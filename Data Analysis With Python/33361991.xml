Great for the casual shooter that doesn't know any better but the P-series has always been different. This is truly an advanced compact camera and one that I find really compliments my Nikon DSLR very well. I previously owned the P7000 and while that was a great camera, I had some complaints. Well Nikon apparently was listening and made the P7700 the perfect P7000 replacement!I realize there was a P7100 but it wasn't too different than the P7000 for me to really call it an upgrade.If you're coming from a P7000 then you'll be interested to know the big improvements they've made!1. SPEED. Everything is faster. From shooting to just browsing in the menu. There is no significant delay and depending on your SD card it's even faster at writing to the memory card.2. They finally added commander mode which means just like certain Nikon DSLRs you can use the pop-up flash to trigger your Nikon flashes via CLS.3. Speaking of the pop-up flash it won't pop-up on it's own anymore. Meaning instead of a silly button that would always get accidentally pressed when you put it in a bag or pocket, the P7700 now has a sliding switch.4. They changed the lens diameter to 40.5mm and to a cap system. Anyone that has owned a P7000 knows how annoying and easy it is for those silly lens doors to get bent in. I had that happen and the repair bill was a lovely $65 from APS (Authorized Photo Services). Thankfully the P7700 has a simple lens cap. It may be kind of annoying because it's easy to lose the cap but you can easily buy a small little cap leash or since the lens diameter is now 40.5mm you can buy a protective lens filter if you want.5. Removed the optical viewfinder. Now some people probably don't like this but I do. On a DSLR I absolutely need a optical viewfinder but on my P7000 I hardly if ever used it. It was tiny, distorted and was awkward holding it to my face. With the P7700's articulating screen it doesn't matter. It allows me to shoot any way I want and is just so much easier. For those complaining that they won't be able to see the LCD in sunlight, it's articulating... freaking move it to an angle you can.6. More manual controls. One thing I hated about the P7000 was the inability to change ISO or the metering mode from a dial like I can on my D3. Thankfully with the function keys on the P7700 you can now do that! This by far is the biggest improvement to me. Makes shooting so much easier and easier to go back and forth between this and my DSLR.7. It's built way more studier. Not that the P7000 was plastic fantastic but the P7700 feels like a brick of metal yet not as heavy as you might think. Just feels SOLID.8. No accidentally turning it on. One thing about the P7000 is you could accidentally turn it on in your pocket and possibly damage the lens. However the P7700 disables the power on button when the LCD screen is folded in.There are probably more improvements I can't remember but those are the ones that stood out to me.I do have one complaint. The articulating LCD screen. It looks great, the problem is with the articulation. This isn't a real huge problem and after you get use to it it becomes a non issue but when you flip out the LCD screen it can only rotate a certain way. It seems logical for the most part but if you rotate it the wrong way too aggressively I bet you could snap the screen right off. But like I said through continued use you get used to it. My only other complaint is the LCD screen is not glass, it's a screen similar to camcorders.So if you're thinking of upgrading from a P7000 don't hesitate, if you want a compact camera to compliment your DSLR then this is the one for you!

$REVIEW.: This is my second GPS, and the third in our family. The first is Maggie (yes, we name them) which is a Magellan GPS 315. Sort of a barebones unit but awfully reliable for a lot of years, it went with me pretty much every where. It wasn't until about 12 years of pretty heavy use that it began to feel long in the tooth. Next, a TomTom GPS for my wife (Tom, naturally) which she uses when she gets out and about, not often but necessary. Now, I figure I could use an upgrade to Maggie, and after some research decided an eTrex 20 would fill the bill nicely.Oh, it does. It does. "Journey" does everything I could've hoped for and lots more. Paperless geocaching? Yup. Downloadable maps? Sure. Savable tracks and routes so I can map trails? Absolutely. Fact is, there's so much this little (about 70% the size of Maggie) wonder widget can do, I'm kinda sneaking up on her various subtle features. Like the walk I did last night, which I looked at later and saw what the elevation profile looked like. Amazing what these things can do! Back in the day I used to dream of having a device that would do this stuff. Oh, there were such things, but they were bigger and heavier and usually they didn't bother with Mac compatibility. Garmin is now very Mac-friendly, and you should have no issues swapping data between your home devices and your GPS.I did mention the downloadable maps. Yes, you could buy Garmin's, and I'm sure they're wonderful and kept up to date, but a single trip to [...] will allow you to choose FREE downloadable maps. They're more-or-less up to date, though for my purpose a topo and a decent street map is all I need. Oh, if you're a hiker, you'll want "My Trails" which adds an overlay of many, many well-known (and not so well known!) hiking paths. I plan to contribute to that map, and right soon! And don't worry about running out of space for all those maps you'll be wanting; if you fill up the onboard memory, you can add a microSD card. Classy!Last spring a couple of friends and I went to Big South Fork to scope out some little-seen arches. Maggie just wasn't up to the trip, and entering all of the details and coordinates was a pain. Not so now with Journey. One-click and the waypoint is entered with all the pertinent info already attached. Geocaches are equally simple.Downsides? Well, the documentation is near-to-nonexistent. The manual, such as it is, you have to download off the device, then print if you want a hard copy. The screen is rather small, so if you're visually impaired, expect that you'll have to have a pair of readers with you. I always do anyway and don't find it a bother. The color and resolution is pretty good, so that helps. I can see the screen would be easily scratched, so a case is a good idea; my wife got me the Garmin-branded case which was on sale and fits like a glove. Oh, and speaking of gloves, it's not easy to work the buttons wearing gloves, but it's probably way easier than other such devices which use touch screens. Just my opinion. Finally, there is no proper compass&amp;#8230;one which will give you your bearing when you're not moving. This is a feature on the more expensive eTrex 30, but as I always carry a compass in the field (you do too, don't you?) this isn't so much of an issue. Another item lacking, and I don't quite understand this, is a lanyard. Weirdly, there is a place you can put one, on the bottom of the unit, and the carrying case even has a place through which it can pass. But there's none included. Why not? Seems silly to me, and a cheap bit of insurance, as many times as I've dropped such things. Anyway, Maggie's old lanyard transferred easily enough and so a piece of her goes on with us...I'm going to rate this at 5 stars, because I think what Garmin has given us here is perhaps the ideal GPS for hiking. But I will be patient and see what quirks, if any, emerge in the coming months and I'll update it as I see fit. Right now, I'm only two hikes and a day's walk into my relationship with Journey, but if she keeps it up at this pace, I think I can safely say that this is just the start of a beautiful relationship.

I purchased it because it generates a true sine wave output. My computer's power supply won't tolerate anything less. I've used probably 7 or 8 APC products over the years, and they've been very reliable. As the earlier reviewer said, this is a redesign of the SUA1000, and it's only been sold for the past few months. The only issue I have with the product so far is that the fan is constantly running -- even when no load is present. And, as the other reviewer noted, the fan is fairly loud. I've written to APC Technical Support because the constant running of the fan doesn't seem to be normal behavior. The fan runs constantly for about 5 minutes, then stops for a few seconds, and then resumes again. This occurs with a fully charged backup battery, running on AC, with no load plugged in and at normal room temperature. The only time I can get the fan to turn off is after I run a self-test. But after about 10 or 15 minutes, the fan begins to run constantly again with those very brief pauses. I'll have to see what the support people say.2/15/2010 UPDATE TO REVIEW:APC Technical Support informs me that the fan behavior I described above is completely normal. If you purchase this product, be prepared for a very loud fan that constantly cycles on and off (five minutes on and five seconds off) even with no load plugged in. When I asked whether it made more sense to have the fan run continuously without the brief pauses to minimize cycling of the fan motor, I didn't receive a response. I have no idea what purpose the brief pauses in the fan operation serve except to remind me how much I miss a quiet UPS. I was told that it would be possible for APC to release a firmware update to modify the fan parameters if enough people complained about the noise, but no firmware update is currently planned so I wouldn't count on it.8/1/2011 UPDATE:APC released a firmware update (see comments) that modified the fan behavior so it only operates when the unit is supplying battery backup to a load. The fan no longer runs while the load is being supplied by the AC mains. I've revised the review to five stars.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this drive as an upgrade from one of the slightly older series Crucial SSD's (that one's a 128 GB model -- forget the exact model number, but they were yellow instead of blue like the newer M4's). I've been running this 256 GB M4 for almost 6 months now and it's been nothing but rock-solid and fast. Just like my older Crucial SSD (that's now in my wife's notebook) - zero freezes, zero blue screens, nothing but beautiful computing power and fast compilations in Visual Studio. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I bought a pair of these used, in excellent condition for $50, not here, just for disclosure, I used them as spare speakers in a workshop and this is what I think after listening to them for a while.Do I know what I'm talking about?  I build speakers as a hobby and my main setup consists of Snell XA90's and McIntosh amplifiers.  So I know what 'good' sounds like and how to make speakers that sound that way.So, as others have said they look nice, I can't disagree there but they are also fairly big, and for as big as they are you're not really getting much sound out of them.  So, how do they sound?High range: very harsh when pushed, lacks detail, very bright.  (If you listen to anything with violin/piano in it you may want to just click to another speaker now)Midrange: Rather hollow sounding in the upper midrange and weak in the lower midrange and also lacks detail, but it's still probably the strong point of the speaker.Bass: None.  It's simply not there, specs say 40Hz.  All lies.  I've tried several amps and checked the phase repeatedly thinking I had to have messed it up but no, it just isn't there, they'll do a very weak 60Hz as their lowest usable bass and even then the woofers have no x-max to move air with.  To really put it in perspective, I compared their bass to a pair of old 4&amp;#34; Realistic bookshelf speakers (also sealed cabinet), and those even had far more bass than these.Intangibles/Comments: imaging is terrible, off axis response is laughable, any sound that's supposed to have 'weight' to it just doesn't, they sound very weak but aggressive at the same time due to the harsh treble.Cabinet: thin MDF.  No internal fill/damping.  No real crossover network, just caps on the mid and tweeter (which, for this speaker works to an extent, but it is very cheap and cone breakup from the midrange in the treble is probably part of why they sound so bad in the high range.)  Cheap spring clips.  No mounting options.  No speaker feet. Looks nice with the grills off though.Drivers: cheap.  very cheap.  very, very, laughably cheap.  Cloth surrounds (the cheapest).  Woofer has no x-max whatsoever.  Tiny magnets.  Tiny voice coils.Now, for a non-discerning listener who has a subwoofer to pair these with and just wants &amp;#34;big speakers&amp;#34; these are probably fine.  But if you actually plan on listening to your music/movies, please, buy something else.  The Micca MB42X is cheaper and sounds far better (check noaudiophile for a professional level review of those).  If you still want a 3 way design Genius makes a decent set of computer speakers that are better than these and they're even powered.  If you really want bass, get the Bic Venturi 6.5&amp;#34; speakers.  If you want something that looks fancy the Jamo P404's (amazon has them for $150 at the moment, I bought those, at that price you're basically stealing them, they sound phenomenal and I'll review them after they've broken in a bit more; but if that deal ends then the HiVi D-1080-IV gets my vote, HiVi makes great drivers and very well designed speakers).  I've made finding/modding cheap speakers that aren't terrible a bit of an extra hobby, and these were anything but a diamond in the rough.
$review_summary.: Look nice, but the sound's a bit garbage.

$REVIEW.: This isn't a $300 tripod, but for $20 you are getting a good value.Pros+ 60 inch height+ Carrying handle+ Comes with carrying bag.+ Price+ LightweightThis unit comes already assembled in its carrying bag and is incredibly light and relatively compact (24&amp;#34;). The carrying handle on the unit is convenient but being so light it doesn't matter where you grab it really. This is my first tripod and I didn't want to spend that much because I've already invested so much into my camera gear. With that being said I think it is designed well enough to support the weight of my camera confidently.Cons- Plastic construction- Weak leg supports- WobblyAt this price range you can only expect it to made of mostly plastic. The pan and tilt aren't perfect but should do fine if all you're using this for is shooting stills, its functions may not be suitable if you're using this for video and expect smooth operation. The leg supports are simply stamped aluminum meaning they can bend easily. The unit is incredibly wobbly when fully extended but that is why they add the hook towards the bottom. A heavy camera bag should solve the wobbly issue when hung from the hook and bring stability, or you could anchor the tripod to the ground with some thin rope if you're on uneven terrain.

$review_text.: I bought this item in February 2010 to switch between a PC and Mac laptop using the same keyboard, monitor and mouse.  It worked very well for me.Recently, the button that switches the monitor started acting flaky, and now it doesn't work at all.  So I just bought a new one.I'm not too upset about it as it was only $18, but it is still a little disappointing that it didn't last very long.

I love the waist strap and the extra support strap that connects to the body strap, it makes this bag very easy to carry while climbing. The padding of the bag is amazing and I love the re-sizable compartments. The water proof cover that goes over the bag works well in moderate rain, though I have never tested it with extended water exposure.My only issue with the bag and the reason I didn't give it five stars is the fact that it isn't very woman friendly. I don't think any across chest bags are made for woman, but this has to be the least worst. I am six feet tall and have a large chest, this makes the "sling" part of the bag a little more complicated. To get the bag to fit securely I have to pull the strap tight, which makes pulling it into the front of my body a little cumbersome, but not impossible. I love that I can let the bag rest in the front of my body while I change lenses or grab an extra battery. What I am sacrificing in this camera bag is their advertisement about being able to grab your camera in ten seconds. This isn't possible if you're a busty woman, but isn't a huge down side to the camera bag. It's still comfortable, still protects my camera and as a HUGE plus looks like a back-pack.I'm a photography major and wore this bag to school every day through all of my classes last semester. It has a pocket to the back of it that is meant for a laptop which I used for books. The only people who knew that I was hauling a thousand dollars worth of camera equipment were those people in my photography classes; everyone else saw it as a back-pack. For this reason alone I felt safe taking it places with me.

$review_text.: I purchased this audio extension cable becuase my Bose QC 20i Noise Cancelling Headphones have a reletively short cord and I have to sit closer to my laptop at work to directly connect them.  When this audio extension cable is used the sound I am hearing sounds like it is coming through a tunnel.  The volume decreases with the audio extension but even raising the volume does not fix the drop in call quality.  I have used an audio extension cable before and did not have this issue.  I am not sure if these are made poorly or if I got a bad cable but I just threw mine in the trash.

 2nd headset worked awesome right from the get go and so far have seen nothing to complain about


 Can't say enough about Amazon and the return of the 1st headset


 I actually got the 1st headset refunded today which I sent back yesterday, Amazon even refunded the 2 day shipping on the 2nd set that I ordered to make sure it got here when I wanted it by
 So received the replacement with refunded 2 day shipping and got the refund for the 1st defective headset same day as replacement arrived!  Amazon is awesome and this LG Tone seems to be awesome as well

 Would purchase this headset again even though 1st one was defective which I believe was "used" and not actually "new" as stated by seller, actuallly did purchase again based on reviews being so good for this headset

 And definately would recommend Amazon to anyone

 It's great to see that a company actually takes care of their customers...that's a dying thing in retail lately

 Great Job Amazon...can't thank you enough for the great service!!!UPDATE:  Have used for a few weeks now and have noticed the the bluetooth connection is not very good with these headphones

 I actually have not had these any further than my pocket and have had them cut out repeatedly!

Everything is bad about it from sound to its craftsmanship


The only thing thats ok is that the cord is a cloth like so it does not tangle

But You will throw these in the trash once you hear its performance
I bought 3 of these brands thinking based on the reviews they might be worth it

I was DEAD wrong! The ones I bought were Scosche Increased Dynamic Range Noise Isolation Earphones with tapLINE II Remote and Mic (Sounds worst than a Radio Shack transistor); IDR355MD &amp; IDR655MD.1) The 655 buttons did not work upon receiving it


I didnt care cause I thought it was my iphone compatibility


It isn't.2) 655 broke after two weeks and I didn't even use it everyday

Unlucky for me I was on our vacation when it stopped working
So by the time I got back I'm sure it was too late to return it.3) The 355 sounded so aweful it reminded me of how a transistor from Radio Shack in the 80' sounded.Its craftsmanship are no match from companies like Denon, Sony, Creative, Sennheiser

If you buy any of these brands least expensive bottom of the barrel low end models --- it will still be better than any of the SCOSCHE top end models! Try it for yourself and I guarantee you will go back to our beloved AMAZON and process a return :)

It stays clean, doesn't use up batteries easily, and the price is great

But I've grown to really hate the sound quality


I put up with it for a long time, but now I just can't stand the tinny high frequencies, and am searching for something better (that's still inexpensive)

Not having luck yet!

$review_text.: Just got this in the mail today.In the first place the price for this is so low I don't know how you could have any serious complaints

I read in a couple of reviews that the power supply was underpowered

IMO this is not the case

The included power supply is 1000ma or 1 full amp
That's surely enough to power half a dozen or so USB devices
My only complaint is that the USB printer cable that connects this to your PC is very short (1/2 meter)
If this is a problem a longer USB printer cable can be substituted.

$REVIEW.: The brush is well made &amp; soft (very important). No loose bristles as reported by some others. I haven't tried the smudge remover yet.For my money, the best brush for optical work is a genuine camel hair brush - if you can find one. I also like a very nice brush I got from Edmund Optical some years ago; it looks just like a lipstick container, and the brush is advanced &amp; withdrawn just like lipstick. It is an order of magnitude better than the Nikon brush - it would get 5 stars easily. Still, this one is good enough to carry in my camera bag.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a case that would help make it look less like I was carrying around a tablet, something inconspicuous. This does the trick nicely. I'm a bit worried the adhesive on the case frame that holds the tablet to the back of the cover may not hold up over time, but we'll see. It would have been nice for the front cover face to have had notches or indentations in it to help keep the tablet from sliding when putting it in a &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; orientation. I have to use the magnetic close strap to keep it in place by wedging it in front of the tablet.

$REVIEW.: I've bought these rechargeable batteries more than once and I love them. They come pre-charged, ready to use out of the package and hold a charge extremely well. The only problem is, with all the kids new gadgets, I don't have enough batteries. Will be buying more soon.

$review_text.: it works somewhat, but I have an airial antenna that picks up better than this one. I took a chance on purchasing because my other antenna is struggling to get signals but picks them up better than this one. Part of my signal issue is trees in the yard. Either way my old antenna picks up better than this one but the caviot of this antenna is when it picks up staions the picture is clearer than my other antenna. With an unobstructed signal this antenna would be a better option &amp; picture. Maybe when I move into my own place it will be better. Its much smaller &amp; compact than my standard ota antenna. Everything works on it &amp; it doesn't spin or move in bad weather or windy days. It is impossible to set by yourself as others have stated every time you push the rotor button it switches direction so there is no way to know where its pointing unless you can set it up in your yard on a pole in plain site through your house window.works well enough that with an unobstructed signal it would be worth its cost. The gain control on it doesn't seem to effect its signal any either which waqs disappointing. But hey its not a high dollar top quality device. I'd say its worth it for the money as you get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: Coming into a new age of possibilities means that technology changes, and sometimes I find myself outside of that loop. I love painting but have always been an old fashioned painter, but now more people are looking into graphic designs and creating art that is 100% on computer and not done in your front yard. Corel Painter 12 has so many possibilities for someone who is so new to this type of art, and as a beginner I can honestly say that I was impressed by how easy everything was to get started. Software was easy to install and even though it will take me awhile to get use to mouse strokes instead of paint I can already see this program far beyond what I was hoping for. With so much to learn and the so much to do I am having too much fun just playing around with the program to get any real work done yet. But that could also mean that with so much to do, the possibilities really are endless.My favorite part:The ability to choose from different brushes and types of paper including their textures! For me this was the deal breaker for I can not only customize my color palette but my artwork really looks like I could have done with paint.

 Instead of fussing with all of the cords for your notebook, the retractable cord makes things simple


 It has nine interchangable tips to match almost any notebook.Compatibility should not be a problem since the charger is supposed to be compatible with over 7,000 models and 10 major brands of computers.I also found it very easy to work with when traveling


 Having the cord be retractable kept my notebook computer bag much less cluttered with cords


 With the other accessories I carry, I don't need a clumsy notebook cord taking up too much room


 It simply makes life easier for those of us who travel or use our notebooks often.Highly recommended!

$review_text.: First of all, these headphones have great sound.  I'm no audiophile and I don't own a significant number of wireless headphones so I'm not the best to judge whether they are the best in their class as far as sound goes.  They are decently comfortable, but the cup size is just slightly too small for my ears.  The range works really well for me, through walls and other things with lots of interference.Lots of people have reviewed these features and I find that I'm not going to add anything to them so I will start with what I find intensely annoying about these headphones.1)  No auto off/power-saving on the HEADPHONES.  That's right, you lay down the headphones one day and pick them up the next the headphones will be dead, hope you weren't planning on listening to them.  I'm unable to comprehend why Sennheiser thought lack of power save or auto off would be ok in a pair of battery operated headphones.  The headphones don't even eventually turn off when you turn off the base and there is absolutely no signal.2) Auto-off on the BASE.  You have to turn on the headphones and the base every time you use the headphones.  When the headphones are turned off eventually the base (which is plugged into the wall) will turn off.  If you put the headphones on the charger it will turn off the headphones which means the base will eventually power off.  It does not turn back on when you remove or turn on the headphones, you have to do that via a separate button on the base.  The only explanation I can come up with for this backwards design is that the engineer that was supposed to put the power-save feature in the headphones concluded there wasn't enough room in there for the circuitry so they put it in the base instead?3) Easy to break the ear cups.  If you run out of battery at least you can replace it.  The ear cups twist to the side.  This mechanism can either be really loose and easy to remove or sometimes it is like you super-glued the ear cup on.  If you force the ear cup the little plastic tabs will break and you will need to purchase new ones.  They are difficult to find, take a while to ship and are expensive.  So be really careful.In all I like the headphones and the mobility they provide.  These usability features make the headphones considerably less desirable in my estimation and I wouldn't pay so much for the same pair again.  When I bought one pair I liked the range and quality so much I went out and purchased another pair.  However, if I had used them enough I wouldn't have.

One to use on a Samsung Galaxy S3 and the other on an ASUS Transformer T100.  While I have not used the one for the T100 yet, I'm a bit concerned about using it.For the past couple of days my Galaxy S3 started acting strange when listening to music, suddenly the music would stop playing and the music app would become unresponsive.  I thought a reboot would do the trick, but no, even then the phone was unresponsive, but if the SD card was out, the phone would be just fine.  Upon checking the Storage option under Settings, the SD card section would forever stay as &amp;#34;Computing....&amp;#34;Today, I took the card out, put it in my computer, verified the card is still in its exFAT formatting and tried to run CHKDSK.  Needless to say, CHKDSK failed with the message &amp;#34;The disk check could not be performed because Windows can't access the disk&amp;#34;.  Hmmmm...bad card already?  So I tried an SD card tested app on my phone, halfway through the read/write test (a 300MB test file), the app could no longer read the card with the message &amp;#34;Card cannot be accessed, please mount card&amp;#34;.Great, yet another bad microSD card.  First it was 2 SanDisk cards and now a Transcend.  What gives?  Are manufacturers that pressed for sales that they simply let QA slip?To top it off, I tried going to the Transcend website before writing this review (2/8/14 8:38pm ET) and the site is down.  Quality service Transcend, quality service.  I'm just going to contact Amazon and return the card.

Keytops are just under 15mm versus just under 16 for my Apple Bluetooth keyboard


The spacing between keys is about 17.5mm versus 19 for my Apple keyboard


 It seems like a good portable size and after I realized it was a bit smaller it gave me no trouble.It is light weight, mine came with the stand and batteries, the special keys (menu, home, back, search) work as expected on a Nexus 7 tablet (with Android 4.2.1)


The top frame is glossy, which doesn't make sense for a portable keyboard.I haven't found some important (to a Unix admin) keys, however: ` (backtick) and [esc] (escape).Option-n gives the opportunity for &amp;ntilde; (option-n n) but if you hit right arrow (or anything that doesn't ever have a ~ over it) afterwards it just gives ~


If you want an accent such as &amp;eacute;, use option-e


This is much like a Mac keyboard


Option-s gives &amp;szlig;

Option-i gives ^


Option-c gives , and finally, option-u gives an umlat (H&amp;auml;v Mt&amp;auml;l).I'll contact Amazon to see if there is a way to get the missing keys, but for now I rate it as 4 stars for most, 1 star if you need any of the missing keys.[Edit] Amazon didn't know but was terrific in all other ways as usual


 However there is hope


^[ for escape seems to work, I'm looking at editing a keyboard layout for GRAVE (backtick) and putting ctrl where CAPS LOCK is.[Edit 2] I edited /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl and was able to turn the caps lock into control, and control into into a grave accent, but creating Vendor_04f2_Product_1109.kl didn't work (I got the numbers from System Profiler on my Mac).Steps, if you have root:sumount -o remount,rw /systemcd /system/usr/keylayoutcp Generic.kl Generic.kl.bakEdit the file to make key 29 GRAVE and key 58 CTRL_LEFT

Or figure out the mapping for, say, option-g.That said, I did get the repeating key problem others have mentioned, and this isn't on a Kindle Fire so I suspect it is the keyboard

 I also had trouble navigating around (e.g
getting to the Send button) but I don't think that is the keyboard
 Finally, getting it to reconnect after turning it off and moving around with the tablet's screen off isn't 100% for me.Regardless of any problems it had, for remoting into systems it will make life much much easier.[Edit 3] It has a lot of trouble reconnecting to my tablet; that plus the repeating key problem mean I'll be returning it


Changing to 3 stars from 4.

It has everything I wanted Lifetime traffic (It even rerouted me around heavy traffic.), and maps, the speed limit for major roads ,and my speed in RED if I am over the limit.It doesn't get much better that this!There is one drawback, it doesn't give you the whole route at the beginning if you are on a long trip.

$review_text.: The HDMI video switching is good except when switching between 480p and 720 or 1080 programs.  Reading through some of the other reviews, they mention something about a 'Pure' option in the Video setup and I'll look for that.  This works great for switching between my PS3, cable and Roku HDMI inputs (with the exception of the video issues mentioned).  I also bought the bluetooth adaptor for this unit and, though it looks flimsy, it has worked very good so far for streaming Sirius from the App on my iPhone (particularly on Saturday mornings while listening to Click and Clack),  My next purchase will be a decent programmable remote so my wife can use the thing when I'm not around the house.

$review_text.: I will admit I was skeptical about this product.  Most things at this price with moving parts usually leave something to be desired, right?  Not this.  My iPad Mini case (Griffin Survivor) came with it's own stand, but it doesn't stand vertically, and just isn't comfortable to travel with.  This is a GREAT alternative.First of all the construction is great.  It is made of durable yet light weight plastic.  it is adjustable for a wide variety of viewing angles, from 90 degrees to about 30 degrees, depending on your preference.  The legs that serve as the base can be positioned wide or narrow, and your tablet will fit by itself or with the case on, no problem.  I tested it with the Griffin Survivor as well as the Otterbox Defender, both are find.Finally, all the contact surfaces come with a skid proof rubber layer, so you don't have to worry about it sliding around.Overall a great product useful for a variety of purposes.

$REVIEW.: I was in dire need of an upgrade and was seriously looking at the 7D.  Realizing that the 7D is rumored for a "refresh" in early 2012, I didn't want to spend the extra money versus the 60D.  Ultimately, I opted for the 60D and I have to say, I don't feel like I'm missing anything from the 7D!  This is a fantastic camera and I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with it! And props to Amazon for their speedy delivery!

The top clamp detaches and has screw threads for mounting on any standard tripod. This was one of the main reasons why I bought it .Even the handle has screw threads if you need to mount it on a tripod then extend it up. The metal clamp holds the iPhone 5S very securely with or without a case. The extra 3 ft of reach is great for taking pics over a crowd or for selfies that don't look like selfies. You do need to download a camera timer app, but there are several free ones available.I took one star off because as many others have said the black rubber piece on the top part of the clamp comes off very easily. It is just held in place by friction and mine fell off just by being jostled in a gear bag. On the plus side it does still work fine without the rubber piece although there is a higher likeliness of the metal on metal causing scratches on your iPhone if you don't have it in a case or bumper.

$REVIEW.: I originally purchased this filter for my Olympus 500UZ and took some amazing photos.My ex sat her big butt on the Olympus (may it rest in peace) (or rather pieces.. lol)I now own a Nikon D-3000, and with it's advanced technology... it filters out IR light.So needless to say, this filter removes all light except IR and my camera accepts all light except IR.So as it stands... black photos.Like I said, with the right camera, it works great. I got shots of a solar eclipse, welding, sunsets, etc.Check your cameras specs before purchasing.

Practically, this was bought for a steal! If anyone wanted a Smart TV this holiday season, this would have been the right offer for them! Now, onward to the review.I have so much praise, but I have a wee bit of function-related negative comments about this TV. I'll begin with the positives.Clear, fluid, vivid, and producing rich colour and picture quality with the TruMotion feature always makes a win into my satisfaction! Transforming every little bit of what my Cable provider (Cablevision) pushes into my TV into impressive HD picture quality, I'm glad I made the switch from a 40&amp;#34; HDTV which name isn't as great as its name (and I won't slander the company in any way.)Yes, there are so many useful apps built in and several more listed in the LG app store. At least it won't be the &amp;#34;same old thing every time.&amp;#34; The built-in apps, of which YouTube and the browser I use the most, definitely increase the usefulness of the TV and worth of other services like Amazon's very own Prime Instant Video! (Now it's worth it to be a prime member, eh?)So there were just three not-so-top things that concerned me, but it doesn't de-value of the product. One of them is simply browser lags and bugs with the cursor. Sometimes, if the latency becomes high enough while scrolling up or down, the pointer might go away until you restart the browser. Keeping in mind about the browser, you might be better off navigating with a USB Keyboard and a USB-Ethernet Extender because, for one, it can be a little annoying to control a Smart TV browser with a remote and you don't want to be so close to the screen to cause eye damage.) Finally, the LG app store doesn't seem like there are going to be a lot of updates coming along in favour for the LG Smart TV powered by Google TV (because, as we all know, the Google Play Store is ever-expanding and LG only makes it bigger.)So whether you see a lightning deal like this again or if you're just out there for a new Smart HDTV, this one makes the cut and shouldn't disappoint you. Great LG quality, great price... just don't rely on it as your gigantic smartphone and browser!P.S.: Haven't tested out Skype on it yet. Need to buy the LG-made camera. Only one other downside, but not necessarily a bad one.

$REVIEW.: Unlike other pocket radios, e.g., those offered by Sony and Grundig, the Sangean's tuner is digital, with no drift. Once tuned, a station remains tuned. The internal speaker is large enough to deliver sound without distortion even when the volume dial is rotated to the maximum setting.

If you own a Sangean PR-D5 radio, try comparing its sound with that of the DT-220A/double Altec Lansing combination, and then play the same station on both simultaneously, one on each side, with the volume equalized, for a simulated and highly realistic concert experience.

$REVIEW.: This manual shutter release does exactly what it supposed to do... the only reason for docking it one star is because it is short.  i've used it a number of times some portrait work and some macro photography.  It beats using the timed release control.  I've had no trouble using a halfway release press to set the exposure control settings.  I've used in in bulb settings at night.  It's definitely a good add on accessory.

$REVIEW.: I've always had good luck with G-Technology. This little G-Drive Mini has given me solid performance in Final Cut and After Effects over Firewire 800. Lightroom performance with RAW files has been satisfying. The performance overall is great for a bus powered drive.Physically I like this drive a lot. The styling is great with G-RAIDs and G-Drives, which is a compliment. It doesn't match G-Speeds too well. Petty thing to complain about, the price difference between this is a factor of ten. The included case is great, just loop a cable and velcro it down around the top so it stays with the drive. It has what I assume to be an elastic belt loop on it. I suppose this is intended to go on the strap of a gear bag? I have no idea who would attach a hard drive to their belt or have their hard drive dangling for life on the exterior of a bag, but it's there if you find a use for it. The fact that a case is bundled is great. More external drives should include cases.One gripe I have is that my laptop (a Toshiba) won't power it over the bus using a single USB cable. If I use a USB cable with two USB ends (one for data one for power) it works fine. Unfortunately G-Tech didn't bundle such a cable with the drive, instead wanting you to invest in an AC power adapter. The lack of need for such an adapter is the reason to get a mini. This is the reason I rated it four stars instead of five.Overall it's a solid little drive. If you need a portable for multimedia get it now. If you want something that matches Apple's aesthetics go for it. If you just need some portable storage you can probably find a more affordable option.
$review_summary.: Always great with G-Tech

$review_text.: Screen is as good as Samsung LED and better then HP LCD I already own. Plastic used for the stand and for the trim around the screen does not seem to be very high quality. Stand cant be adjusted in as many ways as HP and Samsung models. Basically monitor can only be tilted back and forth.  Overall outstanding monitor and I am happy with the picture and how much I paid for the monitor. I am taking one star off for the lack of DV-I port. I had to buy DV-I to VGA adapter to use it with my PC.

It is a non-standard connection to the headphones - smaller than USB micro.  I get that they probably wanted to do everything in their power to keep these headphone units smaller, but this is a pain.  Everywhere I go I have microUSB chargers.  My car.  My nightstand.  My desk.  My kitchen.  You will need to use this USB cable to charge these.  And the cable is very very short.  Like &amp;lt;2 feet.The real kicker is that this port is maybe 10% smaller in total size than microUSB.  Seems like poor design.

I was a streamer at the time, and viewers complained sometimes about being able to hear me breathing, my keyboard typing, or sirens outside.This microphone was even worse, plus added awkwardness in setting up because it needed to be on a surface

$REVIEW.: I bought this mainly because my old Onkyo HT receiver only had 3 HDMI inputs and I was tired of playing "HDMI musical chairs" with all of my components.  When I bought it it was priced at $199, but in the weeks since the holidays it's gone up almost $50!  I was going to buy one for my parents, but I think I'll wait and see if it goes down again.I did not have the "brick out of the box" problem that other people have reported.  I simply transferred all my cables from my old Onkyo, turned it on and it worked.  I then let it update via Ethernet and did not have any problems at all.  It took me a bit to find the audio setting that sounded most like my old set up, but other than that everything was easy.I also have not experienced the HMDI out failures that others have reported so far.I'm using it in a bedroom, so it's powered just about right for a smaller room.  If you are looking for something to really shake the house off its foundation in a larger room, you are probably better off going with one of the higher wattage units, but this one works well as a secondary or small room unit.

$REVIEW.: I have a 2nd gen Macbook Air and this is the second Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter I've purchased.  The first one didn't have audio out, hence the reason for getting this one.Build: not quite Apple grade in terms of plastic quality and cord flexibility, but it is of pretty good quality.  I got this so I can plug it into my TV and leave it alone, so it really doesn't matter.Function: works just as advertised.  Picture is perfect and audio seems clear.  If you're having trouble hearing audio, check your System Preferences: Sound, and make sure HDMI is selected.  Sometimes you might need to log out and back in, or restart the computer, after the connection is made.

It makes the Thrive look like a planner rather than a neat toy.  I think that's important because it makes the Thrive much less of an inviting target for thieves if left in a car.  It is also convenient for carrying the Thrive and provides a stand for viewing the Thrive in landscape mode.  I don't find the weight to be an issue and wonder if the reviewer who did was reviewing the right case.  The only reason I didn't rate this case as 5-star is that I'm speculating that it may become damaged in time due to a weak spot where the leather is only a narrow strip that must zig-zag due to the placement of buttons and lights on the Thrive.  That weakness is due to the design of the Thrive, not any fault of the case maker.  The only thing I didn't like about the case was the packaging it came entwined with.  I almost needed a user's guide to tell me how to remove the packaging without damaging the case.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to other Thrive owners.

After I stopped teaching, I became accustom to PC's. When I bought my first iPad, I decided to give MAC's another try. I can't recall why I ever stopped using them. My best guess is the price. Now I'm hooked on MACs. My work computer is a PC and I don't even like using it anymore. I bought this MAC after I went back to school to get my doctorate degree. When school is in session and I have to travel for work, I carry my work laptop (because I have to) and my MAC just so I can complete my coursework and not have to use my work PC to do it. I won't get into all of the technical comparisons of MACs and PCs; others have already done that. I'll simply say that it's user friendly, easy navigation, the mouse pad is much better than those on PCs (I typically use an external mouse with PCs, but I only use the mouse pad with my MAC) and the keyboard is more comfortable.

In short: I'm impressed. This is an excellent tripod.DESIGN:Tried and true: telescoping aluminum leg extensions with short-throw twist locks, three leg angles with full reversal for storage, a two-level telescoping reversible center column, and a ball head. The legs don't twist. The connection base appears to be made of the same solid cast metal as my Induro. No foam legs covers for cold weather, though.A few significant features are missing: an angle adjustment on the center column (e.g., Manfrotto 190), spring-loaded leg locks, and the ability to detach a leg to make a monopod. Dolica's TX570B150DS does the last; this TX570B150SL doesn't. There's also no way to attach the ball head to the legs absent the center column. Still, both versions come with a decent padded case and two hex keys.Actual weight is 2.64 lbs. Compacted height is 13.25&amp;#34;. The packed case is 2/5 the height of my Induro case and half the weight. Taking the Induro anywhere always involves a mental calculation of whether I'll actually use the thing. This Dolica is like an overstuffed umbrella; I'd throw it in a backpack without a second thought. When set up, height to viewfinder with a 5D II (no battery grip) is 49&amp;#34; (center collapsed), 54&amp;#34; (center up one), and 60.5&amp;#34; (center up two). At 6'1&amp;#34;, I find it comfortable enough at 54&amp;#34; and short at 49&amp;#34;.My first copy had a noticeable tilt of about 2 degrees, I believed caused by a casting defect in the base. My replacement copy has no tilt. This is a nuisance only; it's easy to compensate with the ball head.BALL HEAD:Exceptional at this price. It's strong locked down. I had no qualms attaching my 5D II, battery grip, 200/2.8L with tripod collar, and 1.4X TC. A 20 pound dumbell on one side of the QR plate didn't cause any shift in position. Ball adjustments on all axes are smooth at partial tension. It's actually easier to use than my $150 Giottos.Twisting the base without the lock engaged is smooth. Engaging the lock raises the effort, but not consistently. Double-check that the head is screwed on tight before you rotate the head with high lock tension. It wouldn't be that hard to unscrew by accident.The ball doesn't shift position when it's being locked (unusual, this), but flex in the camera frame itself will cause some droop with telephoto lenses that aren't attached with a collar. The plate has excellent grip and secures tightly by hand or with a coin. It doesn't twist with my 5D II and 200/2.8 in portrait position.There's no trigger on the head to release the QR plate lock, so you need to loosen the top knob all the way and tilt the camera to raise it off the head. Not a big deal, just a bit slower than rigs where you can slide the plate out.STABILITY:Good for this size, material, and weight. Carbon fiber and wood damp vibrations better than aluminum, and heavy tripods do better than light ones. Clearly we're starting at a disadvantage. I did a few ad-hoc measurements. The setup was: Canon 5D II, 100/2, focused on a distant object, zoomed to 10X in Live View. I flicked the ball head hard and timed how long it took for vibrations to disappear. I did this twice for each configuration. I also tried my 200/2.8 (no lens collar) and did one trial with the Induro.All legs extended, center column down: 3 seconds (8 w/ 200mm) (46&amp;#34; to base of camera) (Induro: 5 w/ 200mm)All legs extended, center column up one: 6 secondsAll legs extended, center column up two: 18 seconds (25 w/ 200mm)Smallest leg contracted, center column down: 1 secondSmallest leg contracted, center column up one: 3 seconds (42&amp;#34; to base of camera)Smallest leg contracted, center column up two: 12 secondsResonant vibrations are not a strong suit with the center column raised. They have a definite period as the image shakes, stabilizes, and shakes again as the energy moves up and down the legs. Again, status quo for a tripod at these specifications. Hanging a 10lb bag from the bottom ring reduced the times only slightly, perhaps 10%. If the bag swayed even the slightest bit, leg flex was visible on the screen. I wouldn't attach a weight unless part of it was sitting on the ground.Other best practices:* Don't ever extend the second center-column extension if you can help it. This tripod won't stabilize in any sort of breeze at full extension. If you can, drop the center column entirely and retract the last leg sections.* With long lenses (&amp;#62;135mm), use 'Live View' mode for long exposures. Mirror Lockup (MLU) doesn't wait long enough to let vibrations die.* For short lenses with both center extensions down, MLU is fine.* Use the camera's self-timer or a remote release.* Use tripod collars with long lenses to balance the rig weight directly above the ball-head. This'll also make it harder to knock the tripod over.* Disable image stabilization with slow shutter speeds. If it's very windy or the center column is raised, leave it on for faster shutter speeds.IN SUM:For this price, I like it. A lot. It shames the Manfrotto MKC3-H01, another ~$75 travel tripod I reviewed that has only greater base height in its favor. The closest alternative is MeFoto's A0350Q0T. That one costs twice as much and looks for all the world like the same model. Save for the defect in the first copy, there's no significant fault to this Dolica. Shorter folks with lenses under 300/5.6 may well find it equal to any purpose, travel or not.I'll update if I discover problems with extended use.

Ignored everyone's reviews that said the headphones were a pretty tight fit, and lo and behold.. they were extremely painful.The headphones are pretty good at this price level if you have a head the size of a small grapefruit. They fit on securely, are adjustable slightly, and have a swivel ear cup to confuse you if you knock into them at an odd angle.The durability is good, as they can take a beating, and they include a travel sleeve, which I stole to use for my other, better headphones I later purchased. My girlfriend also tried out the headphones, and agrees that they are painful to wear for more than a few minutes at a time. Have tried to stretch them out using a soccer ball, but to no avail.If you're looking for quality headphones, don't look at low end prices- you can find much better headphones used/discounted that are exponentially better than these ones.

$REVIEW.: This was less than a dollar and it shows.Pros:-Protects your iPod Nano (the sides only actually)-Cheap-Looks ok..

that is itCons:-Fits very loosely-You can't press the buttons easily, you need to use your fingernails now-If you plan to use the clip it won't be easy as the skin takes like 80% of the space available when you push the clip open, I could barely clip it on anything-Use the clip and the skin will slip off-Only protects the sides..

not much protection, the clip is still exposed to scratches and dents.-If you have pets or plan to clean dusty places prepare yourself to clean this skin too
Fur from pets stick to it like a magnet.Buy a complete case or something else, this one is really just something to make you iPod look like a black iPod and nothing more


Useless, seriously, spend more on a quality product, specially to protect the glass from a fall.

$review_text.: I purchased this camera for my wife and she is very pleased.  She had an older Casio but she wanted more zoom.  I read some of the professional reviews that said it did not do well at dusk without the flash but I did not find this to be true.  I have a Canon SD970 IS that I dearly love but this camera runs circles around it.  The flash is one of the best ever and the automatic stabilization is superior to anything I have ever used and I have been buying cameras since the 40s.  The wide angle lens is a nice plus.  Some years back to get all these same features I had to buy the camera body, then a bag full of lens along with an auxiliary flash, rolls and rolls of film and if I got a good shot I never knew it until days or weeks later, sadly some very special occasions were never properly recorded.Update 25 Dec 2010 with the recent price drop I had to order one for myself.

 Don't expect immersive sound and immaculate reproduction, but do expect good sound, decent loudness, and comfort

$REVIEW.: I figured I'd give this a shot on a laptop that was using some ridiculous thermal cooling pads that didn't work at all. Sad to say that this has extremely poor performance. Like the other reviewer stated this does not transfer heat very well. It's very easy to manipulate because it is silicone, but that's probably what makes it have such poor heat transfer. It's not sticky but it will stick to a heat-sink or heat spreader after applied. There is really no point in using this for a CPU or GPU because it is completely inadequate. Just get some thermal paste and you'll be much better off.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Image Quality even on FX camerasCurved diaphragm bladesCons:Distortion (worse than 1.8D)Bottom Line:This is a great value lens with a nice step up in image quality across the range vs the 50mm f/1.8D, and the SWM focus is a bonus for those that have bodies that won't work with screw drive.I have run full lens reviews of the following lenses, including formal resolution tests using specialized software to measure the results.Compared to the 50mm f/1.8D:The new G version is sharper across the frame at all apertures and settings
 A noticeable amount, although it will be most noticeable at large apertures and in the corners


 The new version also has 7 curved (instead of straight) aperture blades so the out of focus highlights will be nicer on the G lens

 The downside is distortion is much worse (about 4x) on the 50mm f/1.8G, measuring a noticeable 1.3% vs 0.3% barrel for the D.Compared to the 50mm f/1.4G:The 50mm f/1.8G performs similarly optically, maybe slightly better in the center, slightly worse in the corners, but similar overall, so image quality difference is a wash


 The 50mm f/1.4G is targeted more towards professionals with better manual focus feel and also twice as long of a focus throw so focus might be more precise on the 1.4G, but slightly slower too

 The 1.4G has 9 curved aperture blades instead of 7, and the distortion is slightly worse on the 1.4G

 The 50mm f/1.4G also has half an f/stop advantage.This lens displaces the 50mm f/1.8D most, the buyers of the 50mm f/1.4G will likely still buy that lens, but this is a huge step up in image quality from the 50mm f/1.8D, and is half as much as the 1.4G to boot


 It will be a huge seller like the 35mm f/1.8.Eric

The top unscrews to expose a threaded shaft which did fit the mounting holes in the bottom of the speakers. Unfortunately for me the bases were almost impossible to line up with the spikes.

$review_text.: I really like this case, but I don't think it will last long.  I use my Kindle sparingly, so far I've read one book on it and half of another in the 3 months I've had it.  The problem with the case I have noticed is that the fake suede interior is starting to separate from the rest of the case, leaving weird looking bubbles in the fabric.  Also, the tab that holds the two pieces closed is starting to fall apart.  In fact the tab started to come apart just two days after getting the case.  I'm still using it for now, just because it was the cheapest option for Kindle jackets, however I'm going to have to replace it at some point.

I had an easy time installing the bottom piece, but the top piece was difficult for me.  I think I didn't have it slid up all of the way, so I couldn't get the top rim to snap on without enlisting my husband to help me.  It is a TIGHT fit on the top, which is nice, but also frustrating.  I didn't want to put too much pressure on my screen while trying to snap it on and I was also afraid of scratching the laptop by sliding the case.I must say, I'm also nervous about taking the case off.  It is recommended to take it off to clean out any debris that might have worked its way in between the case and the computer.  I'll report back once I've done this a few times and know whether or not the case gets any more flexible or if there are other issues.The case does a good job of covering most of the laptop, though part of the laptop bottom (where the hinge is) is exposed on the long edge.  The corners are mostly covered, but a drop at a certain angle could certainly scratch or dent this exposed area.  Of course you might have bigger problems if you drop your laptop on the hinge area (or at all), but it's something to know.Even though the case doesn't weigh very much, I do notice more heft when I pick up the laptop now.  What once felt fairly light and comfortable, especially compared to our 2006 MacBook Pro, now feels heavy to carry around.  If I hold it in my lap, though, it's fine.This case DOES fit in my TwelveSouth BookArc for Macbook Pro (http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-BookArc-MacBook-Pro/dp/B0098EYM3A/).  Without the case, the laptop fits in the insert with the smaller slot; with the case, it fits in the insert with the larger slot. There is still a little room in the stand even with the case on, so the stand does not put pressure on the laptop while the case is on.Finally, the feel of the case is very nice.  Smooth but not glossy, it feels like a very soft and almost velvety rubber.  The photo is a decent representation of the color, though in-person it looks to have a little green in it as well, making mine look almost teal.

Whether one needs to spend time typing on the device or viewing a movie or TV show, this stand knocks the others dead in the water!Nice thing is that whether I am at my desk, someone else's desk, at a hotel, strange place, or even using rubbermaid boxes on top of my bed to set it on, I can get the view that I want and need.Very durable; made of a good quality materials and will probably last longer than my iPad!

This will cause a BSOD till you go into Safemode and uninstall them and then install the correct drivers via ATI.It has 4 star review from me, as I find the big glowing green light circle annoying and not necessary.

So, I ordered a Verso clip on light and while that certainly served my purposes I wanted a case to keep my Kindle safe from scratches as well as I wanted a light that did not require batteries and wasn't so easy to lose
During the day I would unclip the light so I can read without it but once I settled in to read at night I would spend a little time trying to find it (I lose things nowadays, baby brain I suppose)
This light is sturdy, bright and vibrant and I love that I don't have to get any more batteries

The case is thin but decent quality and the Kindle snaps in and I feel like it's very sturdy


I appreciate the light design because it doesn't add weight and I can fold the flap behind the Kindle and it's comfortable to hold and read


I would definitely recommend this case!

$review_text.: If you own an interchangeable lens DSLR, then you need an air bulb blower for sensor cleaning and Giotto makes the best. There are several different models that Giotto makes ant the AA1900 is the largest and most powerful. I also use the air blaster for cleaning the dust from all kinds of electronic gear and its power will surprise you. I have several of these blowers around my house and in my camera kit.Caution: The AA1900 is a powerful blower. When blowing the dust out of the sensor chamber on a DSLR make sure to tilt the camera (lens side downward 45 deg) and only use gentle puffs of air. Too strong a puff could actually send dust up into the prism head, where it is almost impossible to remove.

Anyhow, the various routers all performed exactly the same - and with the same results. But this little guy did the trick!! I got half-way through the set up and did something wrong, so I ended up having to call customer service at D-Link - they were terrific!! It took a while to figure out the problem, but they eventually did and now it works like a charm!! I have at least 3-4 bars throughout the house. I bought this one instead of other choices that might have been a little less expensive because my router is a D-Link and I figured it couldn't hurt to use the same brand - especially if I ended up having to call customer service. Don't know if that was true, but I'm satisfied - with the router, the extender, and the customer service experience!

It's thicker and wider than many travel mice, which is a plus in my book.Now, the bad news - the power switch on it broke the FIRST TIME I used it.  Luckily, I found instructions online for disassembling this mouse, and was able to rig the power switch so the mouse is on all the time - but that doesn't do much for the battery life.  Speaking of battery life, it's not very good - I have to replace the batteries about every two weeks.  I'm using Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries, but I suspect that the smaller current capacity of the AAA batteries this mouse uses (vs. the AA batteries every other wireless mouse I've had uses) are the main factor in the poor battery life.  (For comparison, most AA-powered mice I have go for two MONTHS on a set of batteries.)

 Take a few minutes and learn how to customize the button to fit your equipment and you will likely not need anything else

 I was able to get it setup to operate my PS3 (used primarily as a media player)

 So simply my 3 year old can turn on the PS3 and go to her movie folder and turn on an Elmo video
 My wife also loves it

 Her whole thing with technology is please keep it simply


 No training necessary she figured it out without any help

 This is also a learning remote

 Our DVR has a skip feature that was not not assigned to a key was the DVR was added in the setup process

$review_text.: I couldn't get the WPS button to work, which confirms a suspicion that I have about problems with the WPS function on my router (couldn't get it to work with a different device a few months ago).  I was disappointed that I couldn't just use the two-button setup and frustrated that I was going to have to find a power outlet close to an open Ethernet cable (it seems to be either one or the other in my house, because all the power outlets are already taken).  But I was THRILLED to find that they have a wireless setup too.  I've used two similar wireless extenders before, but they both required wired Ethernet.So I used the wireless method and it took me about four minutes to set this up.  It found my network right away and all I had to do was enter my password.  It linked up and kicked me off the admin page (because it's network name changed as part of the setup).  Then I unplugged it and took it upstairs to put it in its new home.One nice feature that this device has is a signal strength indicator.  That's a first for me.  I got four bars out of five upstairs, which is perfect for my applications.  Now all my portable devices get great network connections upstairs.  I even have a good strong signal in the front and back yards now.Great product.  Simple setup.  Very well done.

It only takes about 2-4 seconds to save to the card.  At the highest resolution I can take close to 5000 photos and at 8MB I can fit about 10,000 photos on this card.  Can't be happier -- highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I should have read the case dimension before buying
Although this case fits the old passport fine, it's too big for the new passports


The material is good, sturdy but not bulky


If your passport is the old(bigger) size or you don't mind the hard drive sliding around within the case, then this case is good.

It does how ever seem less durable but I think it will be fine. The glass lens protector is much more vulnerable to damage. Its pretty much out there. The # has a lip around it so if you were to for example place it lens down on a surface, it wouldn't make contact. The 3+ would. The extra and replacement cases are quite expensive. But on a good note. The camera's. The 3 and the 3+ are virtually the identical size. I realize they are different in capabilities, but size wise there identical. Which means, and Ive tried it out, that you can interchange cases. If youd like to accessorize your 3+ with cheaper options that are marketed for the 3 you can, or if you prefer the smaller lighter cases for the 3+ you could use them with your 3. Everything fits and lines up the same.  The 3+ cases are just smaller, thinner, lighter. And they do have a simpler latching system. Instead of the push to the side and pull back simultaneously and bash your fingers the first few times you use it  until you master it. They have a simple common latch. Super spendy though. I will definitely accessorize with Hero3 cases. They seem more durable, cheaper to buy and if needed maintain. Image quality and usability of course is as expected from GoPro. Fantastic.

 Nikon d5000 with 18-200 sigma lens

 I had to get additional weights and even with additional weight balancing it to have to float properly is very difficult

 Sounded much better than it really is


 Perhaps it will be great for small point and shooters, but for a dslr, an incredible amount of work.

$REVIEW.: I purchased these to go on my Avantree bluetooth headphones to help the headphones stay in place while running.  These fit right onto the headphones, which have a round design similar to Apple headphones in size and shape.  These Acoustibuds are comfortable and stayed in place.  I'm 6' tall and 180 lbs or so, and I used the size 4 adapters.  They fit snugly and comfortably and make the headphones much more secure.  I would recommend them if you need your headphones to stay in place during heavy use.

I've gotta say, for the few minutes I have listened to them, they sound awesome!  I typically have trouble with any in-ear headphone design (I guess I have a small ear canal or something) but I found a great fit so far with the different options of seals included.  The sound...WOW!  I never thought you could get such dynamic sound from an in-ear headphone!  I was very surprised at the bass response (coupled with my Sansa Clip Zip) and heard details in my music  that I have never heard before from any source!  And they're beautiful on top of it all!  I also actually like the cotton pouch...it is perfect to fit the headphones and my music player.  One strange thing...my package did not include a cable clip.  Not sure why?  I'll contact Amazon about it because it is something I would definitely use.  However, it does not affect my review of the product.

ONCE you have it set up properly it works great!  This is the second wireless network I've used.  I set up my old Belkin system by myself about two years ago.  In recent months I've had problems with it.  I had two computers hooked up to it via Ethernet cables, and used the wireless ability of my Belkin router to communicate with my old Epson Workmate 600 printer. Recently I got rid of my oldest computer and replaced it with one suitable for my wife to telecommute to her office system via VPN.  What I've recently purchased is a new laptop, one new desktop for my wife to telecommute via VPN to her office server and two new printers (Epson Stylus Pro 3880 for my professional photography, and an Epson Artisan 810 all-in-one printer for documents, copying, and faxing.)... and of course the Cisco SysLink E4200 router.  Initially I only had my newer desktop and laptop hooked up to the SysLink router.  I had no problems hooking up our brand new computer for my wife.  The problem occurred when I loaded my printer software for the Artisan 810 printer in my laptop and the new desktop.  The printer software could not find the printer.  No problems with the pro printer I hooked up via Ethernet.  Anyway, all is well now and my home network works flawlessly!

Since I primarily use my Macbook as a &amp;#34;desktop&amp;#34; computer with an external keyboard, I bought this keyboard cover to keep dust from falling into the computer through the spaces around the keys. A more expensive cover would have fit the keys bettter, which makes a difference when typing on them, but this one suffices for that, too.

My rooCASE fits snug but it's still easy to remove the tablet from the case


Materials (leather, hook &amp; loop, felt) and finish compare to good-quality day-planner covers I've had in the past
That familiar feel will surely help my transition to an electronic "day-timer" from pen &amp; paper


This model is only the cover &amp; landscape stand


There are no pockets or slots for anything but the tablet
The case adds significant bulk &amp; weight to one of the heftier tablets around

The protection the case will provide and the stand are worth the extra weight for me


It would seem more secure perhaps if there were a clasp for the cover but then the smooth, clean look would be lost


We'll see how the magnetic closure holds up

All the ports &amp; connectors that made me choose the A500 are available while the tablet is in the rooCASE except for access to the microSD slot
Not a problem for me because I don't believe I will need to remove the extra card unless it fails
The docking connector at the bottom is exposed however I don't have a dock yet so can't say if it would sit in a dock well while still in the case
Rear-facing camera &amp; flash are fully exposed

Front camera hole is at the proper location
There is a hole in the case along the top horizontal to the right

I'm not yet sure what it is supposed to expose


I guess I'll have to read the manual! Adding another seven percent to the msrp for a cover seemed expensive but now that I have it, it will be worth it

It is much less fragile and more safely portable


At the time I pre-ordered this, the OEM part was more expensive

Now this has the higher price

Very pleased with item &amp; overall purchase.

I called HP and the wanted $60 bucks for a replacement keyboard. I figured I'd give this a shot. It's GREAT! It is the exact same keyboard for a LOT less money. I didn't know how to replace it, so I did a search on you tube and found a video on how to do so. It was very ease. Remove the battery, remove three screws. Turn it over and unplug the data cable and do the reverse to install. Took five minutes.

$review_text.: the shock mount is made of sturdy metal, the pop filter is made with two layers of cloth with an air space between them

 The filter support telescopes, you can adjust the length and the angle on each end
 All the parts are metal so you can crank down hard on the knobs and not break anything


 The elastic is stiff enough there is not much sag in any mounting direction


 The microphone attaches to a captive treaded ring nut

 The whole thing mounts with either standard American microphone stand threads or the smaller European type threads

 I tried kicking the stand with the microphone live and yes it reduces the noise greatly but of course not 100%

 I thought the price was a little to high but when you consider you get a quality pop filer that is a no-brainer to mount and adjust and remains "put in place" the price is reasonable.This is NOT a general propose generic shock mount

 It is designed for only a few Rode model microphones with threads on the bottom that fit the threaded ring nut.

When it arrived I was very impressed with the quality and finish of the fine leather and the impeccable craftsmanship of the leather stitching and construction. So far five stars. I had read some of the reviews commenting on fitment problems so I made sure I read the instructions and watched the video. Bottom line, the case did not fit properly on closure (came up about one inch from closing all the way unless forced) as others have noted causing me many problems with the magnetic on/off feature. Twice it caused my iPad to lock up and I had to reset to get working again. Apple tech at Apple store said probably caused by rapid on/off cycling when I was trying to get cover to stretch and close properly. Whoever measured and made the pattern for this cover in my opinion was about 3/16 inch short on the flap width. In my opinion I do not believe the leather will "stretch" this much naturally in a reasonable time frame as I have heard this "stretch" nonsense for decades from shoe salesmen when their shoes were too tight on my feet. They never did stretch enough when I was dumb enough to believe them. I have many fine leather products made by Allen Edmunds, Hartman, etc. so while not an expert I do understand the characteristics of fine leather. Since I needed a cover I sent this one back to Amazon and purchased something else as I did not want to use my iPad as a stretching block. I did not contact customer service at the company so cannot offer an opinion on that part.

Believe it or not, everyone does not live in a McMansion with a dedicated media room.Got a good deal on a "refurbished" unit directly from Zvox via Amazon, appeared new. Setup was easy, though I had to go through the remote learning process three times before it took. Making sound adjustments are easy and straightforward. I found that the dialog has been made significantly better and I do not even use the dialog enhancement feature.I did a bass test using the movie Titan A.E., and I would say it held its own. Although, at times there is some bass distortion.  But keep in mind that I am not an audiophile. So far I have to say that I am very impressed by this speaker.***************************************************Update 4-2-2013Just bought a new, heavier TV, the bass distortion seems to have disappeared, so it was probably more of a TV vibration problem.  I read another review recently where someone else had the same problem and he placed a black towel between the TV base and the Zvox to eliminate the problem.

$review_text.: The instructions say1
 Plug the AC adapter of Almond into the power outlet.2
 Follow the on-screen instructions on Almond's touch screen.That was it and presto my 2 to 3 bars are now a solid 5 on my office on the 2nd floor extending the router on the 1st


 It can't be easier than this.Read the reviews and knew this ahead of time;We will have a new firmware available in late September that will address the &amp;#34;Network Name - Almond&amp;#34; drawback you mentioned

It will give you the flexibility to make the repeater network name (SSID) the same as the main router's network (SSID).So when you're setting this up, remove the &amp;#34;- Almond&amp;#34; from the  &amp;#34;Network Name - Almond&amp;#34; and you will not have to change any of your other network settings
 I think my setup was really only 3 minutes as the advertising states.I love this thing


 It sits handsomely on my dresser and shows me the temperature and sky conditions - cloudy for example


 It also can display a clock.Kudos for the creators of this product!

$review_text.: For $8 this thing is a no brainer.  The only reason it doesn't deserve 5 stars is the little tab that lets you turn it into a stand doesn't seem like it would last for a long time without starting to bend outward and get in the way eventually.  Because of that I don't see myself using it in stand mode very often.  But if like me you don't really care about that and really just want a slim protector without extra junk, this is spot on.  Last point that doesn't merit a star drop, no pen came with it and the loop design for it is obvious in the pics so anyone buying this already knows it isn't hidden away, I plan to just snip off that bit to make the case slimmer.

$REVIEW.: This mouse is everything the other reviews said it was. It is actually a bit smaller in person than it looks like in the pictures, which is a good thing since I'm using it with a laptop. It feels very natural to hold, and there is good feedback from each click. My only complaint is that the mouse wheel needs to be pressed fairly hard to click, but it seems to be breaking in well after a week of use. Most people don't use the middle click button much anyway, so it is hardly a drawback. I will definitely purchase this mouse again when I need another one.

I needed the extra length due to the way my room is set up, and for under $5, I figured that if it didn't work, then no big loss
I ordered the cable on a Sunday, it shipped out Monday, and I got it Thursday


I'm sure where you live plays part in the shipping times, But I thought it was pretty quick
I tried the cable on my laptop, and my Blu Ray player

Worked perfect on both


The picture was perfectly clear, and so was the sound


Like a lot of people have mentioned, it's a digital connection


As long as there are no breaks in the cable and the signal gets through, then it's going to work

The cable I ordered was just as described
It does ship in a clear plastic bag inside a shipping bag, but when it involves free shipping, I didn't care as long as it wasn't damaged

Unfortunately, the metal end that swivels out-of-the way to access the usb connector is loose and allows the usb "plug" to be exposed when it is not connected to the port.  It should have some way to "click" in place to maintain the closed position.

It is a bit tight over the viewfinder hump, but not to the point that it stresses the seam or hinders the cushioning effect of the neoprene.This is not a quick-access case when used with an OM-D. It will take a few seconds, at least, to get the camera out and ready to go. I snipped off and fused the internal attachment strap because I don't use it.

$REVIEW.: I loved this stylus the moment I held it
The tip is nice and springy, works great on my 2nd generation Kindle Fire
Tip is long enough to keep the metal of the stylus body from touching the screen, though a few times I used it without thinking and touched the wrong tip, the metal tip and it didn't scratch screen
Well made and nice color, just like the color on the picture

I recommend it to anyone with the Fire, though the clip is too tight to fit on my case, I think that's just because my case is a bit bulky


I will update this if it falls apart or if tip breaks in less than 6-7 months or so, that's a normal life for a stylus, right? It seemed a bit pricey, but I can tell it's better quality than other ones I've bought, and those all seemed to need to be held just right to get a response, this works every time.

$review_text.: I had been getting fair reception on TV, but the broadcast would occasionally drop out because the signal was just a little too weak
I connected this along with a new RCA ANT751R outdoor antenna and we're getting great uninterupted reception now
It's easy to install and all electrical connections are indoors
I opted to insert the power module in the attic before the splitter, but you could just as easily connect it somewhere closer to the TV.

$review_text.: Product is well built and allows access to all those old floppies you just can't seem to get rid of.I use it to access older HP equipment that has floppy drive(s).Worked right out of the box on XP and Linux.  But when I plugged it in to my Win 7 machine, it wouldstart and read one file but would hang at the end.  Then, it wouldn't read another file.XP is fading out so c'mon guys, make it work with the newer OSes.

$review_text.: I had owned a pair of 6i-ER's previously and had to replace them when I tore the cord. I must say that as good as the 6i-ER's sounded these are even better. The bass response is much better and the overall sound quality and crispness is exceptional. I had debated going with a pair of Klipsh over the ear headphones to get a little more bass but hesitated given the bulkiness. I'm glad I didn't go that route. These produce all the nuances of the music as well as solid bass response in a way more portable form factor.

$REVIEW.: Really neat case case for the ipad; looks nice and very functional. One half of the case hugs the ipad from the back and has a swivel mechanism. The other half has a magnetic strip to turn off the ipad when closed. Together they offer a bit of protection and also excellent functionality - better than the apple ipad cover. For example, the swivel back allows keeping the ipad vertical or horizontal and type or view the screen. Do keep in mind that this will protect your ipad from scratches, but not from drops (as others have pointed out, works well with ipad2, but no so good with the newer ones).

$review_text.: I purchased this to use the eSata interface on my external drives from Seagate.  When I started to notice some issues with my MacBook Pro with respect to accessing the drive and file permissions, there was a small note at the bottom of the Sonnet web site stating that there were driver issues with OS X and that the next release should remedy them.A couple months later, the site was updated to state that there is a known incompatibility with a certain Oxford Semiconductor chipset used by Seagate and Western Digital.  It is odd that this card has issues with the #1 and #2 makers of drives.I am not saying it's Sonnet's fault, but you will be SOL if you're using those FreeAgent Pro or MyBook drives.

I saw this thing and decided to get one because I would rather connect my HD Samsung television and my Samsung BDP-1600 Blu-ray player wirelessly instead of having to run two extra Ethernet cords from my modem to each device
It works well and is good as advertised


All I had to do was to go into my network setup on my television and my blu-ray player, select connect wirelessly, enter the modem password, and presto, that's all to it
Now I can go to Pandora, Youtube, Netflix, and Blockbuster on my blu-ray player and can get weather, news, and stock quotes on my television via Infolink


So cool


Because I won't be using it on my blu-ray player as much, I'll probably just use this one instead of getting another one


But who knows: down the road I just might get another one

Samsung is starting to fill my room

Great that it plays a lot of different file formats


Not so great that the remote can barely make contact at as close as even 10 feet from the base unit


Also the zoom starts at 2X and that's not great by my standards for viewing media recorded in wide-screen on a conventional analog TV
It's a pretty decent device, especially for the price, but a couple more bucks can get you a lot more flexibility and more options if that is something that matters to you.

$REVIEW.: We had Minolta film bodies until just a few years ago, bought our first Sony Omega digital body so we could continue to use our 500 mm reflex lens and other lenses. (Sony acquired the Minolta camera line.) Wife-unit dropped the Sony, fracturing the UV filter and damaging the body.  Camera shop said we would do better to invest in new body.  Hard to believe, but the lens survived.Local shops only sell kits that include new lenses, and not equal to what we had.  Bought the body and with the $100 we saved were able to apply savings to a lens we desired.Really love the panorama and dusk features that stitch multiple shots together.  The dusk feature compiles multiple shots to allow filming in low-light situations without using flash.The camera is much lighter and smaller than previous body, a big bonus.
$SUMMARY.: Now I'm glad we dropped our previous Sony Omega

$REVIEW.: My background; I've had a projector based HD Home Theater with a 10 foot wall painted screen since 2006!  My goal is always to build or upgrade a state of the art HD Home Theater for under $1500.Needed to replace my 1080p HD projector.  Researched all options including 3D.  Results, the  ViewSonic PJD7820 FULL HD / 3D 1080p Projector with HDMI.NOTE: I found the major difference between HD &amp; FULL HD is the screen up to 42 inches &amp; Screen larger than 42 inches respectively.  Wow, was I short changed with my 120 inch screen!  Plus 1700 vs 3000 lumens of brightness &amp; 4000 vs 15000 contrast ratio too! What a significant jump in viewing enjoyment!RULES FOR HOME THEATER for 2014: (Remember - this is a theater not a tv, the darker the room (more theater like) the better &amp; more effectively real it becomes!  BIGGER IS BETTER !)DO's - FULL HD (3D) Projector, FULL HD (3D) BLU-RAY player, HI-SPEED HDMI switch &amp; cables, 3D glasses, a 5.1 or greater HOME THEATER AUDIO SYSTEM &amp; HD Projector (wall) Screen Paint.My system consists of; 7820 projector, BDP-S5100 player, SSG-5100GB 3D glasses, Kinivo 301BN switch, AmazonBasics HDMI cables &amp; Paint on Screen (S1 Ultimate Contrast (also good for 3DHD). COST, $950 less audio.NOTE- includes 4 Hi-speed HDMI cables &amp; 4 pairs of 3D glasses.  ALSO already had 5.1 audio system.DON'Ts- Purchase anything less than the above listed!  WHY? With WIFI you need the most efficient system for HD Wireless Video Streaming! hI-SPEED HDMI handles internet streaming too!  Ignore the internal speaker, it ionly provides 2 watt mono sound, even the audio output is only mono.The 7820 gives you everything!  I will only discuss the TOP FEATURES.  This projector has many auto calibrating features to maximize your best visual experience.  The 7820 has an outstanding picture over 2 million pixels worth.AGAIN, ONLY Hi-speed HDMI cables ( less than 9 meters in length). WHY? Hi-speed provides 3 additional advantages with FULL HD, 1. Supports Ethernet / WIFI video streaming. 2. With FULL HD &amp; Hi-speed HDMI all pixels on a Blu-Ray disc are displayed (more than 2 million). 3. Provides enhanced full features for screens greater than 42 inches!7820 HI-LIGHTS:  PROS-6000 hour lamp life (most have 3-4000 hours)3 year warranty (most have 90 days to 1 year), plus 1 year lamp (most have 90 days) plus a 1 yearexpress exchange service! ( no one else has this!)Best price in its class ($600-700)FULL HD / 3D1 HDMI port ( using a 3 port Hi-speed HDMI switch allows a single cable to the projector!  Minimizeswires to the projector to 2 (power &amp; HDMI). Awesome!Consumers Electronic Control (CEC) may synchronize power on/off via HDMI connection for systemDynamic Movie Function- auto power consumption adjustment of projector lamp use.Magnify feature- magnifies or reduces projected picture size for exact screen size presentation.Auto Sync Feature- auto determines best picture quality for the displayed image.Hi-Speed HDMI connections ONLY for maximum visual / sound stream.Keystone Correction- corrects projected image from projectors position, left, right, high or low.Aspect Ratio- Set to AUTO ONLY.3D SYNC- Auto Syncs 3 D equipment.Must have, 3D Projector, 3D Blu-Ray player Hi-Speed HDMIcables/switch and 3D glasses.CONS-1 HDMI port (see PROS)1 internal 2 watt mono speaker. (Only good for monitoring sound during setup. Recommendation isto ignore it otherwise)Fan Noise- about the same as my previous projectors, not bad. (42 DBS?)NOTE: just a little tid bit of information regarding projector placement.  Thumb Rule is 1.4 x screens width.  Also, 1.4 to 1.8 x screens width is the optimum seating / viewing distance from the screen.PICTURE RATING with FULL HD &amp; HI-SPEED HDMI components ONLY!HD cable - FantasticHD WIFI-  OutstandingHD Blu-Ray- The BEST PICTURE ever!PS3 HD games- Unbelievable3D HD- work in progress/distance/syncing/colorsSCREEN.

Permanent Full time HDTV/ Theater (bedroom too!)I use my Theater as a Full Time Entertainment complex to include; HDTV cable w/sports, movies &amp; network tv, WIFi with NETFLIX &amp; AMAZON PRIME etc., GAMING PS3 and HD/3D Blu-Ray movies.  This projector has a 6000+ hour lamp life or 8 hours a day viewing time (just like a HDTV) that's almost 3 years before replacement.I hope this review was helpful and gives you an idea about full time theatre/ tv with this outstanding projector!!!ViewSonic did their home work and this is the one!  enjoy.

$review_text.: Update as of May 2013: you've got to be kidding me - I can't believe anyone is still selling this thing

Peek is gone, out of business - and it happened not long after the "new" Peek came out


 I formerly mentioned going to their website, good support, etc
but all of that's gone now


The site doesn't work anymore either (formerly getpeek.com).This might be an ok toy for a kid but I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars for it.------------I don't know the background on the cause, but I can tell you that Peek Pronto devices NO LONGER WORK


 I don't know why it's still for sale

 There is a problem with the network or something, and they're useless.I'm a (former) loyal Peek user


I loved the email and texting capabilities and bought a lifetime version


 It's now a paperweight, and has to be replaced with new hardware before it will work again - I haven't decided yet if it's worth the expense and hassle
 They've got great service, very friendly customer support, and I like the device itself, but this is extremely frustrating


There's a little more detail on the Peek discussion boards at their website

 I do like the device, but wanted to warn people not to buy THIS specific one
 Order the Peek9, if you want a Peek.

$REVIEW.: I just bought the Logitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black).This new laser mouse works great like I'd expect from a logitech laser mouse.I use it in a business environment on a standard mouse pad, so I can't comment on its hyper-sensitivity (or lack of if that were the case) for gaming, also I can't comment on its effectiveness in peculiar situations such as on my lap, on glass, etc.. since I use it on a mouse pad.The 'unifying' software is awesome... I also have a logitech N305 numeric keypad and both operate on 1 unifying receiver.. WITHOUT any bulky software running in my system tray.Build quality does seem to have decreased from my previous logitech mice.... but that is to be expected during/after a "bad economy".. even successful companies don't "waste a good recession" as an excuse to build things cheaper... (1) the battery cover is thinner, I'm afraid of breaking it.. and (2) the scroll wheel feels cheaper/lighter/less precise.One positive improvement, in addition to the unifying receiver, is the on/off switch on the back which will extend battery life so

I inserted my old hard drive that have been sitting in a dawer for like 4 years and viola...that was it. You slide the back cover, slide in the card drive in the enclosure and then plug in PC (USB port ) and power. My PC picked on it right away...no formating needed. Ansd Now i have an extra 320GB storage space thanks to this little enclosure box.Great buy, very well priced since everything else i foung at local stores was double the price and that is with tax and shipping.

$review_text.: The monitor overall is well made by a great company and has an amazing display, especially with video games.Pros:Extremely thin1ms response time!Very good viewing angles2 HDMISome cons that irritate me:The ASUS logo - Everytime I power on the monitor it displays the ASUS logo for about 5 seconds. Not a big deal the first couple times but slow gets annoying.Tiny, hidden buttons - Power and menu buttons are located on the bottom part of the monitor and are very hard to find. You will get skilled at it but I still have trouble finding the button I need.Inputs face out - The HDMI inputs face outwards instead of down or sideways so you cannot have the monitor flush against a wall.Can't be mounted - Base is connected to the back of the display and wall mounting is not possible.Besides those three, the monitor is fantastic and ideal for gamers looking for a fast response time with powerful HD resolution.

$review_text.: I couldn't resist writing a review when I saw these as Amazon's "Today's Deal" -- the price was $50 lower than what I paid for my set, but they are an amazing deal even at the regular Amazon price


 I installed mine about 6 months ago, and they still sound fabulous

 My Energy RC-Micro 5.1 replaced a set of much heavier Bose bookshelf speakers that I wanted to replace only because I didn't want to worry about mounting such heavy speakers every time my family moved.I live in a large apartment with high, 11-foot ceilings, and these speakers fill the apartment with crisp highs and booming bass


 My movies and music sound awesome through these Energy speakers


 I dare say that to my ears at least, they sound better than the larger, heavier, and more expensive Bose speakers they replaced.The only complaint I had with these speakers is that the couple of universal speaker mounts I had did not fit them without purchasing some right-sized bolts from the hardware store
 (They do make custom mounts that fit these speakers perfectly, but I didn't want to pay for yet another set of speaker mounts.)At the "Today's Deal" price on Amazon, I would have quickly jumped on the purchase had I not already bought a set 6 months ago.

The problem was despite claims that "it'll fit both", the third generation iPad is just a bit thicker, and so it didn't quite fit right.  And over the course of the month or so I had this other cover on the new iPad, the corners started cracking out of the blue, and small pieces would fall off.  Finally last week the last piece of the top fell off, and it would't stay on at all anymore.  Now, I baby my electronics.  I never even so much as dropped this thing a foot onto my heavily padded mattress... So there was no stress, no dropping, nothing other than simply "being on it" that caused the stress cracks and breakage.So I started looking for a new one for the third gen iPad, and came across this.  The price was great, so I figured even if it didn't work, I was out basically nothing.  So I ordered it and got it.It's a little thicker than the one I had been using and it fit just great.  Snaps into place and you can wiggle the corners a bit, so you know there's a little bit of wiggle room there, it's not tight to the point of causing stress fractures over time.I like the material.  The one that broke was a real slick surface, this one, while still a hard plastic, has a little more grip to it.  And I actually like the cut out of the apple logo on the back since that gives a good spot to get a finger or two to hold the edge of the case for a little more security as well.Cover came well protected with sticky plastic stuck to it to prevent scratches.  Works great with my smart cover I took from my iPad 2 when I gave it to my 8 year old.Can't beat it for the price, and for the quality at this price, it's a steal.  No-brainer for me, this was a good purchase.

$review_text.: When I ordered my iPad from Apple, I also ordered their case. What a disappointment. It was so flimsy that I went on a mission to find something better--had to protect my investment! Checked the cases available at Amazon and had it narrowed down to two. I decided on this one, and I am glad I did. It's a great case, and the cost is incredible for the features. It is very nicely padded and the bumps on the other side work well for keeping the iPad upright (especially great for watching movies). The only detraction (as some others have stated) is that the edge by the on/off button does buckle somewhat. Five Stars nonetheless! Even though it is not REAL leather, it looks like it, but, more importantly it is constructed well. I have since looked at other cases in stores, and I think I made the right decision with this one. I don't think you will be disappointed.

It's bulky, and the thin elastic straps over the corners of the Kindle are flimsy and horrible. I switched back to my old case almost immediately; and since Amazon and its partners are falling all over themselves to phase out Fire accessories in favor of  the new Fire HD, that case will have to do for the life of my device.

This replaces an older "n" unit that I was using

This ASUS unit looks good, and has a high-end finish


The old unit that I had broke apart in two pieces (its cheap plastic case was not well made)
The ASUS unit appears well made, and it maintains a high throughput and broadcast speed

So far, ASUS seems like a good buy
Be advised, however, that the actual body of this "dongle" is wider than most USB ports
So, unless you use the provided extender adaptor, you'll be limited on where you can permanently install this unit
With, or without, using the adaptor, I get a 5x5 signal
Excellent!

$REVIEW.: I had read about these covers for DSLR's and before I could even decide if I want one for myself, I found this on Amazon (Amazon is like genie who keeps suggesting things of interest). Before I can blink my eye, I had this ordered.This fits very snugly and adds some grip to my Nikon D7100. Honestly, it might take some time to get use to it as it does add bulk to your camera and even the marking for the buttons are not very clear but all this balances out when you realise how important is it to protect your costly gear. You will need to remove your horse shoe cover that came along with DSLR and slide the one thats part of this cover. Honestly it's annoying but then you get used to it.It comes with screen guards for back lcd and top info lcd.

$REVIEW.: I have 6 smaller USB iPhone battery extenders, and this is the only one I now use.  Some of the others do not suppy enough power for the iPhone5 (did work for older versions).  Some do not have enough capacity to charge the iPhone5 fully or more than once.  This unit is larger than many, but it Works for my iPhone(s), iPad (full and mini), and other odd devices.  In 6 months of regular usage, it still seems to work well with no obvious loss in capacity (just a feeling - no scientific measurement made).  I am not sure why one should have to turn it on to use it (other lower-powered extenders sense when power is being drawn and switch on automatically - effectively).  Maybe the problem here is that the 9V/12V option requires an inverter and hence needs a switch - with my use mostly being the USB output, the switch is one more thing to remember when plugging something in - small quibble, I admit...

External noise is sometimes an issue, but I work in NYC so that's to be expected and these are not noise canceling


The in-line volume control is very handy and the cord is longer than most headphones, which is convenient when I need to stash the mp3 player in my backpack and set it down and keep the headphones on my head

I also use them when I watch TV and can turn my head so my ears are on the pillow and not have the earpieces dig into my head.

$review_text.: The video with the stabilizer is fantastic however, it takes a while for it to focus which is annoying

That's #1It takes great pictures especially at close range!It looks and feels great


Having a touch screen is fantastic
It's easy to use.It records sound very well however, because of the way it's designed, I tend to hold it where the microphone slots are and that muffles the sound
I got used to not doing that but it does happen from time to time
You hear your hand shifting around it


That's #2When you record the video, it will set either landscape or portrait depending on how you are holding it which can get annoying
 It should have a setting for a default set up which never changes


Maybe there is one but I can't find it

That's #3As a device on a tripod outdoors in bright light, it's wonderful but that's not what I need it for


I need it to record things like dirt bike riding, zip-lining, races, etc and it just does not cut it

It also really lacks in low light situation.I am going to order the Kodak Zi8 which I've read is leagues beyond.*Update:  I did the firmware update for this model and it has made the camera focusing problem much better


Upping it to four stars!

It's a fixed focal length. This means that you can't zoom in and out like with most lenses to get the composition you want. You have to move toward or away from your subject to compose the image.2. It doesn't have the AF-S motor built. It relies on the older "screw drive" motor for auto-focus. If you have a D5000, D5100, D5200, D3100, D3000, D60, D40, or D40x, you won't be able to auto focus with this lens. It still works great with manual focus. Even though you have to manually focus, the in-focus indictor  WILL work in your viewfinder, so you'll know you're in-focus at the chose AF points.3. It does not have image stabilization (VR) built in. On the lenses I have that have VR, I use it all the time. It has saved me from more than a few shaky shots. This one doesn't have it. Not a deal breaker.The good - it's a very fast, f/1.8 lens. The colors and contrast are fantastic.If you've got an FX camera, it's perfect for portraits. If you have a DX sensor (the less expensive, or entry-level Nikon DSLRs), the effective focal length is closer to 80mm, so you'll have to stand back further in order to get the whole subject in frame.The lack of the AF-S makes the autofocus a bit slower than with newer, more expensive AF-S lenses, but it's still not bad. I assume that it depends on the speed of the motor in your camera (see note 2 above) and honestly I have no idea if this speed varies from camera-to-camera. It's just noticeably slower than some of my other Nikkor glass.A couple of negatives...1. The construction feels more like a kit lens than I was hoping, it's very, very light and while it feels solid, it does not seem to have that same great fit that the other lenses in my bag have. It doesn't feel like it's going to come off, it's actually a bit snug when turning to lock it.2. The rear lens cap is a disappointing cheap plastic cover that looks more like discardable shipping material - no turn/lock, just slips on/off. I actually don't even know where it is anymore.3. Made in China. This was a lot more disappointing than anything else. Though I haven't found any flaws with it, and pretty much everything is made in China now... it's my first Nikkor lens that's made there. I think my reaction is more emotional than objective.(Edited 3/8/14 to clarify auto-focus piece)

$REVIEW.: Had WD fail and a Maxtor because of a poor design or something and or not good ventilation and they were not powered on all the time just for backups. Hope this one lasts but so far every external I looked into had problems. I have a passport also now that stopped working and then it did when plugged into another usb port which doesn't make sense because they are all USB3. Also a friend bought different ones from Costco and had 4 fail in a row in about a year. So I'm just crossing my fingers on this one and get a different second one to mirror just in case one crashes like most of them do. Also it makes no sense that it can only work with windows.Update today june 30 2014  So the Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 had only 6 hours of use for backup only then all of the sudden it was not recognized by windows explorer when it was before being plugged in an out before. Same with my other seagate drive which was a seagate free agent that started having the click of death (look that up if you don't know what it is) I made a mistake above saying the other was a Maxtor external...i have so many computers and drives and got them mixed up. So i opened up the cheap plastic case and hooked it up direct to the computer via USB and no clicking which means that it was the controller in the case and got all the data back. Now as far as the Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 that wasn't recognized i can't give it a proper rating yet because it didn't show up as a drive and I already had return labels ready to ship it back for a refund because in any partition program it showed up as a healthy drive but not as an NTFS file system and I thought how could that be since it was formatted that way and has all this data on it. Seagate help site was zero help like nothing at all. So I thought ok I'm going to have to run a recovery program to get the data back in RAW format since seagate had no answers for it at all. Then i tried something different after alot of people giving me stupid advice that didn't know anything saying update your usb drivers and the seagate drivers which is really stupid since the drive shows up as normal but not NTFS and I have been building and working with computers for over 20 years. So i opened up Disk Manager in windows and right clicked both seagate drives that worked before and assigned them other letters X and Y and viola it showed up in explorer and all the files are there even on the one that was clicking and the WD passport that wasn't showing up. Hope this helps someone that thinks their data might be lost but isn't and still there and not pay some company thousands to con you for data recovery which I have done myself for cheap on actual dead drives.So I have the return shipping label but think I will keep it for now but from all the negative reviews I'm going to get another probably a Hitachi which has a really good endurance rating. Also remember If it's just a back up drive then use it for backup and and shut it off after.

I've discovered this seems to do a bit worse reading rental discs than my normal Sony Blu Ray player, but after cleaning the discs it seems to be working
 Hopefully this'll be the last time I need to update the review!Okay, here's my original review, which for the most part is still relevant:I've been surprised it's taken Sony this long to release a portable Blu Ray player, considering they were one of the main companies involved in the standard

 I've been scared off by negative reports on some earlier portable players by other companies, but thought I'd take a shot on this.Random things about it:-The unit physically looks a lot like a notebook computer


 The screen opens up just like one (and it looks even more like a notebook when the screen's shut)


 It's black, and kind of a very dark blue that is easily mistaken for black
 (I'm noticing in some pictures it looks fairly bright blue, but in real life, even under bright lighting, it looks almost black-it's not garish at all in other words).-The screen can swivel around, so it's facing backwards, or folded flat against the base


 I'm not really sure why I'd want to do that, but the hinges seem to be really sturdy.-The controls on the unit itself are unfortunately touch based instead of physical buttons, but they're also indented, so they're easier to hit than they'd otherwise be
 It also comes with an almost totally normal IR remote, which works great
 (Virtually identical to the one my normal Sony Blu Ray player shipped with, except it's a little bit more compact.)-The unit's battery unfortunately seems to be sealed...I suppose if/when I ever get rid of this, I'll unscrew it and pull the battery out for recycling.-The screen is "matte", instead of the more typical "glossy" (reflective) screens used on most notebook computers

 Matte looks less flashy in stores, but actually works better, since you're not seeing reflections all the time

 I'd assume that the LCD panel itself is identical to ones used in 'netbooks'-it's the same size and resolution as the typical 'netbook'.-Unfortunately I *STILL* don't know for sure if this uses cheaper/older florescent backlighting, or LED backlighting


 For a variety of reasons, I prefer LED
 Since Sony doesn't say, you'd assume that means it's using cheaper florescent lighting...except it's fairly bright and seems to more uniformly go up and down in brightness when adjusted, the way LED backlighting typically is


 Is Sony just inexplicably not marketing a selling point on this?  I don't know for sure.-The screen itself looks good, and appears to be QUITE watchable with shows or movies
 I wasn't too impressed in the store, but it looks better at home, and better still once I actually threw a Blu Ray in


 While the resolution is "only" 1024x600 rather than a full 720p, on such a small screen, and considering you'll probably have it at least a few feet from your face, I doubt that'll make much difference


 At any rate, both DVD and Blu Rays look great, it maintains correct aspect ratios, etc.-The unit uses Sony's XMB (Cross media bar) interface they've been using for the last few years on everything from the Playstation 3/Portable, to newer TVs, and normal Blu Ray players

 It's a straight forward interface that makes adjusting settings pretty self explanatory-of course most of the time you'll just be launching a disc from the 'Video' section, so barely even using it.-Volume and sound quality through the built in speakers actually seems surprisingly good


 I don't know how it would be on a noisier environment though (a car, for example), but it seemed a bit louder and better than my typical 14" notebook, which is saying something considering this is physically smaller.-According to the manual, the unit weighs a bit over 3 lbs (also similar to notebooks using the same sized screen!)-The unit includes the aforementioned almost-normal remote, regular (and pretty small) power supply, and also an power supply for use in a car's cigarette adapter


 It also has a composite cable for connection to a TV

 Of course using composite instead of HDMI means it can't output HD, but it's still nice to have.-The unit has an HDMI port, but doesn't include an HDMI cable (most products don't include a cable, unfortunately).-It also has a proprietary part that apparently lets it accept composite INPUTS, but unfortunately doesn't include a cable for that
 Unless maybe with adapters the input cable would work?  That's theoretically a neat feature-you could display an older game system or the like on this unit's built-in screen, for example-but I'm not sure how you'd find the necessary cable (Unless the input cable would work, with three adapters).-Performance seems good
 It actually loads Blu Rays faster than my 2009 Sony Blu Ray player (which works fine, but this does seem noticeably faster)


 No complaints about that

 Every Blu Ray and DVD I've used has loaded just fine so far, just like my normal player


 DVDs seem to be scaled just fine on both the internal display and through HDMI.-Unfortunately, the headphone jacks are shut off when it's outputting HDMI (the volume controls also stop working, and the internal speakers are shut off)

 Thankfully, the monitor I'm using it with has an analog output...I'm running a cable from that to my notebook, and from that to my headphones...bit of a weird work around, but works fine
 Of course this won't matter if you're using it on a TV, or if you're using it with it's own built in screen.-Bizarrely, you don't seem to be able to shut off the internal screen when it's outputing through HDMI...it just mirror's almost everything to the external display (everything except the menu to control the internal display's brightness, contrast etc
 That menu only displays on the internal display, and the settings don't affect the external display)


 The closest I can do is just turning the brightness all the way down

 Seems like there should be a toggle to shut it off completely, but...-Like my TV and normal Blu Ray player, this has an Ethernet jack for doing firmware updates


 You plug it in, it checks, and lets you install an update if available
 For whatever reason though, while this was 'seeing' that an update was available, it couldn't download it, and eventually timed out with an error about the server not responding


 This may just be bad timing-Sony's update server might be down today or something

 I was able to work around it by downloading the update from Sony's support site (it's pretty easy to find), sticking the files on a CD-R (Sony even gives you instructions for who to do that on the support site), and sticking the disc in the player

 It took a LONG time to finish the update-felt like 10 minutes-but it worked fine.Everything actually seemed to work just fine before the update, but the release notes mentioned a few things it changed
 Of course this is probably just a one or two time thing-don't know that it'll ever need another update.So anyway, aside from the few minor issues mentioned above, so far this seems like a quality product
 The performance and compatibility seem fine


 The screen looks nice


 HDMI out works

 The remote's nice, etc
 Seems like a safe choice if you're looking for a portable player, and technically it could even be used as a normal player (except that the internal screen will be on the whole time...unless I just haven't figured out how you shut it off).

Running 4.2.2 Android OS, access to the Google Play Store, and XBMC playability are just a few of the features on this device.The Android media player uses a quad core CPU, 2 gigs of DDR3 RAM, and 8 gigs of Nand Flash for custom installs and installed apps. This device also supports external hard drives up to 2TB, and has an SD/MMC card reader that supports up to 32GB.On the back of this Smart TV Box, you ahve the power input, AV Output, HDMI Output, LAN, and a Digital Optical Audio Output. A home theater system that's close to the size of your hands and powerful! Offering a chance for surround sound and HD quality movie/TV watching.This media player also has Wi-Fi and although you can't see an antenna, the signal is actually quite strong. Wireless N/B/G are fully capable with this system. I haven't had any interruptions while using Wi-Fi, but I did have HD playback issues. I didn't have the problem with the hard wired connection, sometimes the HD file playback on Wi-Fi can cause issues, but it wasn't the players issue.Along with the Quad Core Smart TV Box, they throw in a remote that works well with the system. The remote features the most important buttons you need and you have full access with it.

$REVIEW.: In theory, the Kanex SnapX would be great for me. I could hook up two macs to a monitor and easily switch between them. However, only one of the display cables was functioning on arrival. So all I had was a 1x switcher...The weight of the central box is very light while the cables are very heavy and non-flexible, so this won't stay on the desk very easily, unless you clip it or otherwise attach it to something. The clip is clearly designed for a thin based monitor, i.e. an apple display, so it probably won't clip to another vendor's monitor if it has a thicker base.The switching button on my SnapX was noticeably askew. I don't know if this is related to the problem I was having with one of the cables not working.

After sending all 4 back here is my take on ASUS and the republic of gamers laptop.  First off none were impacted by the new Sandy Beach processor (at least not that I was able to single out).  The bottom line is either you get a good one or a bad one.  Regardless some things are the same. Frist, yes there is bloatware and no two reivewers have removed it the same way and once you do there are messeage errors that haunt your system.  The lighted keyboard is sometimes working and sometimes not working.  Yes you can reload drivers or press fn and f4 or you can reboot or you can pray but in the end its always something and there are multiple ways to fix the problem however does the solution stick (I am not sure it does).  Yes sleak design and great feel, and packed with a lot of punch and amazing display....but how many times do you have to reinstall the software after you have backed it up for 2 1/2 hrs? I am not going to discuss the weight or size of battery life cause its a gaming laptop and the last 5 reviews have all been on the money.  Asus needs to pay attention to detail and take care of the things mentioned over and over again.  Yes put some things on the back of the laptop so right handed and left handed folks dont have the power cord and other devices in their way.  I believe ASUS has built the best bang for the buck and can do even better by paying atteniton to the words that others have taken time to write.  I will more than likely give this another try and pray the 5th time is a charm.  I have a desk top with ASUS COMPONENTS AND IT ROCKS!!!  ASUS IF YOU ARE LISTENING ...GIVE US BACK UP DISKS ALL READY TO GO...GET RID OF BLOATWARE YOU CAN DO WELL WITHOUT IT (VOLUME SALES).  Hard drives not be divided.....You are kicking ALIENWARE AND OTHERS TO THE CURB. Read carefully the reivewers from AMAZON CUSTOMERS AND YOU WILL GO FAR. As for me, I am going to buy another one and hope this time I get a laptop that works and not one that dies, freezes, sends me error messages when I try to connect to the internet, goes blank after rebooting, lets me play WOW without kicking me off the game on numerous occasions, and last but not least....delivers everything its meant to deliver and more........I will follow up with another review after I get my next laptop.  By the way the 4 laptops were purchased during the month of May.  On another note...Amazon is the best and took great care of me...my hat goes off to them for sending me out laptop after laptop.....Your customer service is the best...THANK YOU AMAZON YOU ARE A CLASS ACT.

Fintie does not increase the size of the Kindle Fire by much but it is something to hang on to so the tablet does not slip from your fingers. Should you drop your tablet it offers considerable protection. And most important for me, I can easily eat or sit and read or watch without propping the table up on something. There are two viewing angles with the Fintie, the main one being almost perpendicular to the table surface and the reverse, tilting the tablet up about one inch. I wish the reverse angle had a catch or a lock to prevent the cover from slipping out of the latch groove in this configuration but this is a very minor consideration. It works just fineThe cover closes with a magnet strong enough so it does not fall open but is easily pulled open with a finger. Buttons and speakers of the Fire HDX are fully accessible at all times.I have seen quite a few cover/stands for the Kindle Fire HDX, many much more expensive than Fintie. After owning this now for more than a month I would still choose it over any other one I've seen.

And that is I can squeeze more video and file content onto these Verbatim disks whereas with those other brands I cannot! There is a little more storage space on these! That has made a difference at critical moments in which I needed to fit those extra few megabytes onto the same disk.I am on my third 25 disk spindle and undoubtedly will opt for the 100 disk spindle when the time comes to replenish my supply.I have decided that I won't use any of those other brands until either the manufacturing quality of these changes for the worse or they stop making them altogether -- I hope neither happens.Anyway, these are as near to perfection for burning video and files onto as I have been able to find and I recommend them to you heartily!

You'll thank me later.My first experience:I bought 4 of these from Amazon less than 1 year a go, and 2 have gone bad and had to be replaced.  The warranty is for 3 years, so you can go to Western Digital's site and get an Advanced RMA, BUT you have to pay for the shipping!  So 2 of these drives actually ended up costing me $20 more than I paid for them on Amazon because I had to pay for individual shipping (they went bad at different times... of course!).  Lost money on the shipping, lost data that was on the drive, lost the time replacing the drives, lost a couple weeks off my life stressing out about losing the data.  If I knew then what I know now, would have paid $20 extra and bought the other drives the first time.My second experience:A few months later (before the first 2 drives died), I purchased another 4 of these same drives from another site (cheaper with free shipping as well) and found out after the fact that they won't work in a RAID 5 configuration with Windows XP because of XP's 2TB limitation.  I upgraded to Windows7 and thought I was in business but because these drives are eco friendly green drives, they shut off after a certain threshold of inactivity.  Ya, that doesn't work for a RAID setup--can't have drives dropping offline every once in a while.  So after much research I found out there's a work-around to turn this feature off, but WD says if you do this it voids the warranty and they won't replace the drive.  Man, I can't win!  1 year later and I have to buy 4 new hard drives again!My advice:Don't EVER go with cheapest if you value your data.  Is your data, your time, and peace of mind worth the few dollars you save?  Yep, I totally agree.  Pay a little more and buy something else, these drives are NOT the best choice out there.My 1-star rating:That said, based on my experiences, it doesn't seem right to give a drive 5 stars that just sits there and stores files like any other drive out there that has the same exact specs/features; so I would have only given them 4 to begin with.  However, it does seem fair to knock them down 50% of those 4 stars because 50% of the the drives went bad in less than 1 year.  However, some people think 2 stars means they must not be that bad if you gave them more than 1.  I don't understand it but that kind of logic is why I'm giving these 1 star.

$review_text.: The Sansa Fuze is a neat little player for people who like to listen to music for a long time.  I've had it for a year and I honestly can't think of another use for it.The Good:-The screen is a bit small but it's crisp and bright enough that I never needed to use it on the highest settings.  When looking for songs I could hold it at arm's length and have no trouble reading the titles.-The battery lasts an extremely long time.  I charge it for about 15 minutes every 3 or 4 days.  It's never died on me and I've seen the low battery alert maybe once.  I also love the fact that I can hook it up to my laptop or any USB slot.-Over 500 mp3 songs can be stored on it, quickly though Winamp and Windows Media Player.  It would be nice if there was some iTunes support but we can't blame SanDisk for Apple's NO-PCS-ALLOWED policy.-It also comes with neat (but mostly useless) little extras like a clock in the corner, album art display, ability to change the color of the background, radio, equalizer and so on.-The headphones that came with the player are better than most packaged headphones.The Bad:-While the headphones that came with the player were better than most, after they fell apart (Yes, they literally fell apart)I noticed that the Fuze has nearly no bass.  Playing around with the equalizer didn't do anything but make my music sound very canned.  In fact, I'd say that the equalizer really isn't good for much except making music louder.-It's not very sturdy.  The player itself feels cheap and plastic.  A few months ago, the black top layer started to peel off exposing some silver plastic-y material underneath.  More recently, the top half of the player started to separate from the bottom half due to me dropping it a few times.  I have to keep snapping it back on every so often.  I've bought cheaper Sandisk products that I've had longer and they still haven't fallen apart like the Fuze.-If you have a lot of songs, scrolling can be time consuming and just a pain.  There are options to organize songs by Artist, Song Name, etc but there should be a way to get from A to Z faster.The Ugly-THE VIDEO FEATURE IS ALMOST A LIE.  VIDEO SUPPORT FROM SANDISK IS NEARLY NONEXISTENT.  I never tried to put videos on my Fuze until a few days ago when I thought about writing this review, honestly.  But I can count on one hand how many videos I've gotten to work properly on my Fuze:One - A softsubbed mkv, which I had to convert with a user-made program made for the Fuze, that lost it's subtitles and played the video too fast causing the audio to lag behind.Two - A hardsubbed avi converted with the same program but the subtitles were so small that I had to hold the player inches from my face.SanDisk's solution is to offer users a "firmware update" that contains a program called Sansa Media Converter.  However, when updating, the option never appeared for me and since then I haven't been able to get ANY videos working on my Fuze.  I did manage to find a standalone download for SMC but it didn't recognize my player.In conclusion, if you're looking for a decent mp3 player for a decent price, the Fuze is a good option.  But if you're looking for an all-in-one type of device that SanDisk advertises the Fuze as, look elsewhere because just about everything else is useless.

$review_text.: This monitor lives up to my high expectations. The 120hz is GENUINE, not a marketing gimmick like the 120hz televisions which simply interpolate frames to give the illusion of 120hz. This monitor will definitely help your aim in shooter games such as cs, cod series, dod, whatever other crap you can think of.This monitor is definitely worth its pricetag when you see the difference it can make in a gaming environment.As far as 3D vision... I would never attempt to play video games in 3D. I might be interested in adult films in 3D, but games... dgaf.The fact that this monitor also comes with an adjustable stand at this price point is also very appealing to me, I'm very anal about my setup being ergonomic.TLDR; If like pc gaming enough to spend over </review_text><review_summary>Pleases</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1D74YWB3PF5PU"><latest_review_date>21/04/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00829TIA4</product_id><review_date>21/04/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>worth the money</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1D9KGPRZBQQ4Q"><latest_review_date>19/03/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00A4796D6</product_id><review_date>19/03/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Looks impressive but didn't perform for me against DB8</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1D9N6K66OGOYJ"><latest_review_date>06/10/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00005A1K1</product_id><review_date>06/10/2014</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>great speaker</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1DBA5DSNARK9R"><latest_review_date>24/04/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0001R05Y8</product_id><review_date>24/04/2012</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>No problems and pretty ergonomic feel to it.

$REVIEW.: I own a lot of SD cards for various filmmaking implements. This is the nicest looking SD card I own. Which is a strange metric to rate a card with, but really. It's so pretty.Otherwise, it's a class 10 SD card. It writes fast, I can record RAW video onto it fairly handily.

The keyboard is delivered with batteries (I think 2 AAA), and when you press the connect button and enable the BT on the iPad side, the password is shown on the screen and you can already use the keyboard to enter the password.The keyboard feels pretty nice on the hands, spacy and comfortable, it looks like a black apple keyboard. It has some function keys like home screen (equivalent to the home button), search button, play-fwd-backward etc. It's definitely easier to type on it than on the onscreen keyboard.Keyboard box/stand - it's very thin and easy to open and use. It supports 2 placement options for the iPad, portrait and landscape.What I didn't like about this product:1) I still had to use the touch screen in many (most) cases2) When the keyboard is connected, It disables the on screen keyboard. So you actually have to disconnect the keyboard to be able to use the on screen one.3) No height change capability (like most standard keyboards)4) (I should mention I'm a PC power user) there were several places/activities where I expected the keyboard to be functional and it failed me. One simple example is when you google something on safari (in the search box), you see the google suggestions options, but the down arrow does not work to traverse and choose the option. The supplied documentation does mention that this is something the app developer should support - so I guess it's apple's fault.5) Documentation - there is a URL for support documentation on the package - first, it does not lead to the right place, second - it does not add much to the details on the package.6) Switch language - couldn't find a way to do it7) Box/stand feels cheap and plasticyComparing to apple's keyboard:1) Warranty - you get 3 years vs 1 year from apple2) Price - same3) Size - apple's keyboard is delivered without a box, just a small dock, so a bit smaller &amp; lighter.4) Batteries - sameAll in all, great addition to enable faster/easier writing on the iPad.a note to Logitech:* Adding a mouse/touch pad to the keyboard would be great* See my comment about documentation

$REVIEW.: I should preface this review by admitting that I'm not generally a big fan of earbuds for music-listening. Over the years, I have been buying more full-sized and portable headphones for my listening....but there is something to be said for the tiny size of earbuds. So, I have bought a few sets of earbuds in recent years. When paired with my Sansa Clip+, I can literally keep my entire system in a small pocket.These Polk Audio earbuds have really impressed me not only with their sound quality, but their comfort. The sound is rich, clear and very nicely-balanced. Of course, the bass response will never match those of larger diaphragms, as found in headphones, but you can't have everything. As far as earbuds go, i don't think I've heard better than these.They came with several different sizes of ear cushions, which is great for tailoring to one's own ear canals.Also, I don't own an iPhone, so I can't speak to the iOS connectivity.

I have a full-face helmet with a flip up chin guard but unfortunately it generates a lot of wind noise when riding. I was able to put these headphones on and slip a helmet over top without discomfort. They cut the noise levels down tremendously although the fact I can't hear vehicle engines at all means a bit more work for the eyes.The real revelation for me was taking these on a plane. Without being plugged in to anything they immediately cancel all the noise you normally hear. I was sitting at a window seat beside the engine when we took off and could barely hear a thing. Plugged in to the entertainment system they allowed me to hear the programs clearly without having to crank the volume. If you have ever used the headphones the airlines give out you know what I'm talking about. Wearing my Bose QC20 was the difference between a loud conversation at a bar and sitting in the symphony.I work in an open-office environment where sometime concentrating can be difficult with several people speaking at once. All I have to do is put these babies on, tune in to my favorite chillout track from di.fm (at low volume) and I literally can't hear anyone else around me. Its like my own portable privacy booth.The manufacturing quality seems really good so far and I've been using them every day for the past month. The cord is very flexible and feels high quality. The connections around the battery pack are reinforced to prevent wear and tear. The ear buds themselves are the usual high quality Bose tech.There is a button to turn noise cancelling on/off. If you just put the buds in without turning on the device, there is a noticeable muting effect. Turn the device on and shut noise cancelling off and its almost like you don't have the earbuds in at all. This is useful when you are getting ready to go somewhere, have put the buds in, but someone wants to talk. However I found I could not ride with noise cancelling off as the wind noise was still very loud.In short, this is a fantastic device. Time will tell how long it lasts.

It is amazing.  But shortly after receiving it, I accepted the upgrade from iTunes to v. 3.1.3.  this has been nothing but trouble since. I've restored.  Randomly after I recharge or if I leave it on and it shuts down on it's own, I have to do a soft reset (sometimes several times before even that works) to resume function.  ON the apple boards this is apparently an issue (along with other problems I've not had) since the upgrade.  I really really want to love this product, but this makes me crazy.  I may have to take it to the Apple store (which is not a short trip)

$REVIEW.: The battery does not fit very well
 It keeps falling out

 Currently I have it taped in place
 Need it badly so have decided to keep it but a very poor fit without much battery life
 It runs down in approx

one hour.

There's an up arrow there.  I touch type and have done it for years.  A cordless keyboard is supposed to allow me to get away from my desk.  I don't look at the keyboard.  And with this one, I get stuck with pressing the up arrow key when I want to shift.  This is just wrong.  It breaks my concentration and wastes my time having to focus on the tool and not the thought.  What were they thinking?  Logitech didn't do this to the K810.  If you touch type, think about this before you purchase.  A keyboard shouldn't cause this much aggravation.  (I have the K810 and love it.  It just doesn't have the built-in touchpad.)

$review_text.: This product is designed for a 13.3" Macbook, but I selected it because I have both a 13.3" MacBook and a Sony Vaio laptop (SR series) and thought it might work for both of them.  Turns out it did.  The Sony fits perfectly (12.4" width)!I carry my laptop around quite a bit and I find that this case provides a good protection - good thickness but doesn't take too much space in the bag.  I have actually been shopping for a case for quite a while but found the price point often too high and the material too flimsy - not with this case.  The price point of $24.99 seems reasonable.  Also, the color selection offered is great as well - I received the Moka one, and really like the design, look and feel.The item arrived in a ziploc-like bag, sealed, and with a little color swap on the outside so if you were buying this in a brick and mortar store, it would help you see the true color and texture.Overall, I'd recommend this case to anyone looking for some protection for their 12 or 13 inch laptop.

I'm very glad I did.This little radio does a great job, especially for AM purposes, where my favorite newsradio stations are.  I had no trouble tuning in on my favorite stations (AM and FM) including one station that broadcasts from Tampa, FL that I'm able to pull in from the opposite coast. The TV does quite well, but my area only uses 3 or 4 channels within the 2 to 13 range, so I hardly use that band area.The only surprise (for me) came with the needed use of an antenna for the FM and TV stations. Normally, the wire for the ear buds works as the antenna, but if you use the on-board speaker (which works great) you'll need to use the included antenna wire which plugs into the ear bud jack. But that's not a big overall deal.The first day I used it I accidently dropped it on the brick floor with no ill effects. One battery popped out from the impact. It still works fine - just a few tiny nicks in the front.I'm glad I didn't buy a cheaper radio, which is what I had originally set out to do. I like this radio. It's easy to handle, it's already taken a beating, and it works really nice. I look forward to using it for years to come.UPDATE:  Five months later and I have fallen deeper in love with this darling little radio. It's been dropped and slobbered on countless times (on tile, brick, and concrete flooring) by a 1 year old toddler. It still looks and runs great. (The lock feature comes in VERY HANDY when dealing with a curious toddler. Super feature.) My husband has complimented me on choosing this radio...it's helped us through Hurricane Charley and helped beat off boredom the days without power afterwards. I do not regret buying this radio and would gladly buy it again and again and again if I had to.

Viewing angle is excellent, and the automatic brightness adjustment works well.This unit does a good job on handling standard (480i) inputs.  The stretch mode will adjust a 480i picture to the size of the screen, maintaining the 4:3 ratio (i.e. black bars on the sides).  The zoom mode is appropriate for letter-boxed DVDs and movies, and enlarges the letterbox to fill the screen, again maintaining the original aspect ratio.  There are some additional stretching modes, including a "smart stretch" mode that pulls out the sides of a 4:3 image to fill the 16:9 screen without distorting the center of the image.  Works fairly well, but generally with a 480i picture I'll either use sidebar or zoom, depending on whether or not the image is letterboxed.For higher quality inputs, the available stretching modes are dynamically adjusted to a set appropriate for the input.  Generally they do the reasonable thing.I've got anOnkyo TX-SR607to handle the audio, so I have no comments there.  One minor annoyance is that TV displays "No appropriate audio signal found" whenever the input or picture mode is changed, unless you've turned the sound on the TV to zero.The HDMI control on the receiver has a few warts.  While turning off the TV will turn off the receiver, turning the TV on does not turn on the receiver.  However, changing TV inputs to another source and back to the receiver does turn the receiver on.  Seems like a firmware bug, but the latest update didn't fix it.

This is definitely the smallest digital camera on the market today, and the styling is superb, making it one of the things you want to own the moment you see it on display.Under the beautiful skin is a capable digital camera, with 1632x1224 resolution (good for prints up to 6"x4") and very good image quality.  The small flash does limit its use in dark settings, and the lack of optical zoom sticks out as a disappointment, but considering the typical use for a camera like this -- quick snapshots, party memories, candid exposures -- the overall package is still excellent and the feature compromises understandable.(For the ultra-cool and compact digital camera with optical zoom -- 3X at that! -- I heartily recommend the Minolta Dimage X and Xi, also available on Amazon.com.)The camera's lens, rated at the 35mm equivalent of 33mm (which makes it a wide-angle), is well made, as is the case with all of Sony's cameras.  The camera has center-weighted auto focus with macro capability, and also center-weighted auto exposure.  Shutter speed is rated in the 1/30 - 1/2000 range, typical for consumer-class digital cameras.  The LCD viewfinder measures 1", which is quite small but still usable to most people except those who need thick reading glasses.  You get a few digital effects (black&amp;white;, negative, solarize, soft snap, etc.) when you do feel the creative juice flowing.  You can also take 160x112 MPEG-format video clips, but I find this feature pretty much uselessFor power the U20 uses two AAA NiMH rechargable batteries.  You can buy these batteries for cheap at Radio Shack, for example, and the camera kit comes with a recharger, although you can buy fancier ones that charge in less time and condition the batteries as well (actual benefit: unknown).  I've taken about 30 pictures, all with flash, so far, and the batteries are still good.  I definitely prefer these batteries to LiIon since 1) NiMH AAA is cheap and sold everywhere, and 2) they hold more power than LiIon and also have more rechargable cycles (i.e., they can be recharged more times).  I'll update the real-world battery life rating once I get a better picture of it.Weighing in at 4.5 ounces with batteries and sporting the "I'm just cool" styling of Sony, the U20 is a little digital camera you'll love and carry with you all the while.

$review_text.: The Gigabyte GTX 770 is a fantastic GPU that will crush just about any game you throw at it. The Windforce triple fan system keeps the card really cool, generally below 70C even in the most demanding games, and stays extremely quiet because three fans share the workload instead of two, which results in lower RPM for each fan and less noise. Gigabyte as a brand is top notch, I've never had any serious issues with their products and anything small I have contacted them about was dealt with promptly.Before the price drop of the GTX 770 and 780 I would have said the GTX 760 carried the best performance per dollar ratio for GPUs. Recently the 770 has dropped from $400 to $330 while the 760 has stayed the same at about $260, which gives the 770 a significant performance boost for the minimal price difference of $70. The card generally only has a 10-15% percent performance gap with the 780 but costs $190 less, that's insane. It can also easily play 1440p at high framerates, unlike the 760. For these reasons, the 770 has reached a perfect middle ground of high performance at a (relatively) low cost.One thing to note is that this card is basically a tweaked and overclocked 680. This means that the headroom to overclock is rather slim. If you are looking to go crazy with the overclocks you may want to look elsewhere, I got mine to +78 coreclock to 1300MHz and ran a tad hot at about 76c.

$review_text.: I don't regret buying this, but it's not what I expected. It's not anywhere near as plush as the photo makes it look, but it is faux fur on the outside. It's more for a fashion statement than actual protection of your computer. It has zero padding inside, and I mean zero. It's just faux fur and linen lining. It is very cute, and looks good in my bedroom. I only use it to store my laptop if I'm not going to use it for a while, I wouldn't use it for traveling.

Very compact and portable! Comes with a retractable cable with 2 attachments for a micro and mini usb cable. Uses a micro usb for charging the external battery pack and will work any micro usb cable you have laying around. There are indication lights on the device as well to inform the use of the current charge and use state. There is a power button on the side as well to tell the device to start outputting the power. There are 2 full usb ports on the the front for 2 devices you want to charge. They both have a rating of 5v and one is at 2.1 amps and the other is at 1 amp for those that know what this means.There is also a nice carry pouch that comes with this as well with draw strings. There is plenty of space for the battery pack, the cable, and accessories this comes with. Depending on the size of your phone, it may fit in as well. My sprint nexux 4g will fit in with the charger as will my og evo 4g.This will charge with ease my sprint nexus 4g and my og evo 4g.If you look on whatever device charger you are wanting to charge with this and it is outputting 5v/ 2.1A or 5v/1A then this should work, sense it will be power and rate of flow as from your current charger.This is great for camping or for power outages, anytime when you will want to be able to charge your phone without easy access to an outlet. Also being able to charge 2 devices as once is very nice!I love this and would recommend it to anyone!

$review_text.: The light given off by this Kindle add-on is nice and even.  There is no "hot spot" and it is not overly bright.  Unfortunately, it does not travel well.  The unit is bulky and when curled up is a little smaller than your fist.  It takes up a lot of room in your briefcase or suitcase.  Also, the on/off button can easily be turned on when stored.  Once, when I opened my briefcase I found the light on and almost all the battery used up.  Poor design.

I'm blown away that you can get a sub like this at this price. I have heard many more expensive subs and this one can hold its own with them. While it can not get super low it gets low enough for me. We compared this sub to my buddy's HSU VTF-2 MK 3 and were amazed at how well it compared. The VTF-2 did get lower but to my ears the PSW505 sounded better (particularly with music).

The first one never quite worked, but that was two years ago
Has Intel's WiDi technology improved?Sadly, not that much
In all fairness, I should point out that it's difficult to review and rate WiDi adapters, because the whole WiDi thingy requires both the adapter and the PC that has the WiDi technology to work well together


Case in point, at first I tried to connect to this adapter from my one-year-old Lenovo desktop

I tried for ten minutes without success
After some digging -- and that's after getting really frustrated! -- I realized the WiDi program "Intel Wireless Display" on my Lenovo running Win7 was an older version
Actiontec does tell you that you must have Intel Wireless Display version 3.5 or higher in order to work

I hadn't seen that, and even if I had, I wouldn't have thought that my version of Intel's software was already way out of date.I then tried to connect from my new Toshiba touch ultrabook, and it worked flawlessly
It found the Actiontec right away and after entering the 8-digit PIN and waiting for over a minute for the WPS security check to pass, I was connected.I give five stars to this adapter because it's small yet well built
You just plug in the power cord and the included HDMI cable, then run the Intel software from your PC

 I like the looks of this little guy.Unfortunately, the entire WiDi experience is no more than 3 stars


 I put my Toshiba, which has a latest i5 processor, just a few feet away from my TV and the Actiontec
 I've got full-strength WiFi on the Toshiba

 Yet video played over WiDi is pathetically jerky, even for a 480p video streamed from a popular video site

I haven't tried playing an HD video file yet, and to be honest I'm afraid to even try it, because I feel I'm gonna be really disappointed by something that's unwatchable.I'll be honest with you
I think I'm gonna stick with the HDMI wired connection directly from PC to TV, which is delay-free and you can go full HD


Heck, if you've got a 4k UHDTV you can even go all the way! But I doubt you can do that with a WiDi setup


So I don't see what value WiDi really brings to us
If you just have to have WiDi, I can highly recommend this Actiontec adapter, though!

Something synthetic rubberish.The shiny part is a bit like denim in the back with a glossy wax cover.The matt section is like that of the scuba suit but harder.The overal workmanship is good.The iPad is held by a thermal polyurethane molded piece that is sewn on the backing.The camera hole cut out is clean cut without right on the center.The weight is a bit heavy (subjective), some like it heavy, some not.This line of Belkin folio cover is very nicely executed but priced on the high end.If you get any dirt on this, it is very easily cleaned with damp cloth wipe down.I recommend this folio if you have the right budget for it.

Works great.I just began using the adapter on a very old Sigma 28-70mm Minolta mount lens - and geesh, this lens seems even better than the Panasonic lenses I am using on the m43 camera.I am going to order a 2nd adapter and just leave one each on the Minolta mount lenses. Very pleased.

I use my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for games, movies, reading, internet, music and office document editing.The case allows you to easily hold onto the device with one one through the strap on the inside of the one of the case flaps.  It is elastic so for right now it is holds on tight to my hand, but I am sure that overtime the elasticity of it will go away.  This is great for reading on doing things with the Kindle in portrait mode.  However, It can be troublesome to use it with your left had as the strap is on the right half of the case but it is not a deal breaker in my opinion.Once you put the device in the case, it is very secure in it.  I do not see any wiggle from the device while shaking it. The case does allow you to view the device in landscape mode with three separate angles.  To get it to do that, you just pop the device out of the bottom corner tabs and the case loosens to allow you to select your angle.The speakers on the device are covered when you have the flap on the back of the device, but the case does have perforated areas near the speaker locations.  The sound does come out fine, but it does sound a little bit muffled.  However, if you want to listen to music or watch a video, it is a lot better in landscape mode and the speakers are then uncovered.  Also, having the case where it is located in landscape mode allows the speakers to be somewhat wrapped as if you had your hand there shooting the sound back to you.The speaker allows you the easily charge your device in the open or closed position so long as it is not in landscape mode as the hookups are blocked.  The headphone jack is not blocked at all and neither are the power or volume buttons.  However, it can be a little difficult to press the up at times.There is a hoop on the side of the case that allows you to attach a stylus.

 Clearly it is of low quality and most of the keys stick, meaning that when you press them they do not register a press

 If you are not always ensuring that what you press was accepted you will see missing characters

 They also feel like they are sticking most of the time
 Not all keys are affected it seems to be about a third of the keys in various locations.This is particularly bad for a lighted keyboard as if you think about it the people who need a lighted keyboard are those like myself that do not touch type and tend to look at the keys when they are typing and not at the screen.It is still useable for me on a secondary computer that I seldom use and may be fine for others who do not type much and mostly interact through the mouse.

$review_text.: Pros:PriceSound quality is good for this price rangeCons:Cheaply madeOther thoughts:These speakers work well for computers and mobile devices.  I use mine to listen to music in the shower, or outside while the kids are playing.  I think the sound is pretty good, but if you are looking for rock concert volume you need to look at a different price range.  There are no bass or treble adjustments, but was aware of that prior to purchase.  The subwoofer driver is exposed on the bottom and looks to be made out of cheap paper.  Overall these are great speakers for listening to music at normal/mid level volume.

 The range is advertised as 30 feet; however, I experienced a range of about 20 feet indoors when there are no obstructions

 At about 20 feet, the signal starts to miss.You can listen to music and take a phone call easily with the push of a button.Overall, I recommend this as a speaker to listen to music and a handsfree speaker phone.

$REVIEW.: I don't have an iPad of my own at present but was able to test this product using a friend's iPad.  I must say I was fairly impressed that it synched immediately with no fuss.  I will confess that I have never been impressed with any keyboard thta Apple makes, However, Targus does seem to have a keyboard that responds in a way that a PC person like me can appreciate.  But the downside is that the keyboard is very small and it seems a little bit too flimsy in the middle. I type fast and furious and I do not like feeling so "cramped" when I work.Things I would rather have had with this keyboard and I have with every other device keboard I own are:*10 key numeric keys off to the right for putting in figures - a definite must when doing financials and spreadsheets.*lighted keys.* A carrying case. - When one travels, having a case for device accessories is a must.
$review_summary.: Great keyboard for the iPad

$review_text.: We have a dozen or so cameras (all exterior) located around the house and property, but due to how the front porch and door is recessed, it would have been nearly impossible to mount a dome or bullet camera to cover the front entrance without it sticking out like a sore thumb. I decided to mount an indoor camera to cover the front door and I installed this camera approximately 2 months ago. I wanted to try a concealed/covert style to avoid mounting an obvious dome or bullet, but must admit I fully expected the quality to be crappy because of the low price. I was wrong. This little camera not only blends in perfectly on the ceiling, the resolution is indistinguishable from 750 tvl cameras mounted outside. This camera does require more light to operate than our outdoor domes and bullets (when they are in color mode), but I don't need it to, nor would I really expect it to. I am extremely impressed with the quality of this camera and am amazed at the price. I strongly recommend this camera to anyone who needs an interior day only camera, but doesn't want to install an obvious camera. I should probably point out that I did not hook up the microphone, since I only needed the camera. Therefore I can't comment on how the audio works, but have no reason to think it wouldn't impress me just as the video has.Amended review on 9-2-2012:I have just installed a second one of these cameras in the office and experienced the same results. Once again, I'm very pleased. This is a very nice camera at a remarkable price.

$review_text.: After using my kit lens with my t1i for a year I decided to invest in other lenses to have more control in low light situations and to create beautiful dof  in portraiture. This lens was a perfect and affordable choice. Yes, it is plastic, but as long you take care of your equipment you shouldn't worry about it breaking or scratching. If you are low on budget or just getting into portrait photography this is a great lens!

$review_text.: The inexpensive jack was a perfect solution to getting the RCA output of my VCR to work with my other S-Video based video components.The DVD and Satellite receiver are S-Video but the VCR was RCA.  Even though I have a video switching Onkyo receiver, I still had to swith the video input selection on the TV when I changed between S-Video (Sat Rcv/DVD player) and RCA sources (VCR).  Too much switching for the young kids.Put this little baby on the RCA output of the VCR plugged it into the Onkyo and bingo.  No more need to change the TV video input - it's all S-Video now.Picture is great.
$SUMMARY.: Works perfect - converted V CR to S-Video for easier switching

 I have a carbon fiber tripod that is lighter and even more sturdy, but it cost well in excess of a hundred dollars

This tripod comes very close to matching the carbon fiber unit

I knocked off one star because of the effort to crank the extension rod on which the camera mounts


Maybe there is a defect with the one I have, but it requires so much force that I worry about the handle breaking someday
And when I crank it to the down position, it almost falls down on its own


I know there is a tightening nut to secure the height, but it is definitely loose or disengaged

It is only the upward cranking force that is an issue

I may consider adding some lubricant to the gear, but I am hesitant to do that just yet
I read the other reviews and nobody mentioned this issue, so maybe it is just this unit I have that is problematic.Otherwise, this is a very good tripod


It has two bubble levels, one of which is a circular bubble to adjust the extension legs

The other is a conventional level built into the camera mounting base


It checks the level in the vertical tilt direction and when combined with the circular bubble level, you should get a level photo every time if you take the time
But the camera base level is not so convenient to see.The tripod camera mount has a quick release base so you can pop the camera on or off the tripod quickly

 All three feet have pivots to adapt to the surface of the floor or ground

There are lock nuts for every possible setting, so nothing is going to slip if you take the time to engage them


 There is a hook on other center shaft to add a weight for further stability if you are inclined to carry a weight around with you


I'm not one of those people
 And there is a carry handle that I've never seen on a tripod
The legs are made of tubular aluminum for light weight, but still very sturdy construction
Overall, I think this tripod will pass the long term endurance test in the field
I have several other cheap tripods that all broke, usually some plastic piece and especially the crank handles
There are plastic pieces on this tripod just like any other tripod, but they appear to be fairly strong, especially compared to the cheap tripods


Anyway, I am about to take a trip to China and the Philippines, so I'll find out soon how it works in a real life situation.

This worked out great for tagging my photos inAperture 3and the integration was easy, since no software install was really needed for working with this on a mac.  My mode of operating was to put it in the constantly recording mode (I downloaded the PDF manual from the website as that was newer than what was included on the cd with the packaging), then whenever I finished shooting photos, I turned it off again (though sometimes I forgot).  At the end of the day I would connect the logger to my laptop and see it as a drive with a folder full of log files in there.  I copied these off to my computer and then deleted them from the logger (to make sure there was enough space).  In Aperture after importing my photos into a project I then added my GPS logs to the project.  Using the Places tool in Aperture I could then line up a photo I knew with a GPS track, Aperture then prompts me as to whether I want all of the pictures automatically tagged based on the timestamps (adjusting for the difference between the photo I picked and the track time for the location I picked).  Now I can browse my pictures on a map and see where it was we were hiking.The battery life was great and the logging seemed to work well based on the tracks that I saw.  I used the strap that came with the logger to strap it to my camera bag or to my belt loop when not carrying my bag around with me.  A couple of improvements would help this product:1) Add an LCD for some information display2) Display the battery life percentage on the display3) Display the time that the GPS unit thinks it is, making it easier to check the time on the camera to make sure things are synced upI'm glad I bought the device, even though I was uncertain based on the reviews I saw and I was taking it on a trip without having time to test it and get used to it.  This will be one of the items I make part of my standard travel kit.

 There are times when a program will spit data to the drive and all the sudden I'll see the drive at 95% full!  Use the free program winDirStat
THIS PROGRAM IS GREAT!!!!  It sorts your drive contents by size

 This way you can locate where big chunks of data are on your SSD and relocate them.

Subtitle worked perfectly fine.Files with DTS audio plays flawless directly on TV speakers without requiring any additional DTS receiver.Very responsive remote control.Played lots of MKV files of size 8GB and greater with h264 and DTS audio from an external USB drive and they all played very well. Subtitles were supported and no jitter in playback.MKV playback is awesome and Up-conversion works great.I can clearly see the difference between regular playback and upconversion (the files I have used were IMAX HD documentaries and Disney Pixar movies i.e. quality of the original file was good to start with).I tried Verbatim LTH some very cheap media from Meritline and Optical Quantam BD-R burned using IMGBURN in my LG  WH10LS30 Blue Ray burner and everything worked flawless.I tried about 20 of dirt cheap DVD media Dynex, Teon, Playo etc. which had avi files with variety of codecs recorded about 5-6 years ago and they all played without any issues.Blu Ray disc loads really fast the picture quality is crystal clear. Also quality of You tube and picasa is great.Overall, it's great inexpensive player that played many media from various sources. It played various file formats not even supported by Philips 5982 Divx player but I still can't retire my WD Live as its picky about codecs i.e. not all mkv files plays flawless and MOV doesn't work at this point.UPDATE: I was successfully able to play Blu-Ray video files (m2ts) directly from hard drive via. USB connection. Menu is not supported but the files played successfully.

$review_text.: Now this is a great idea: a fan that stands upright, with a variable speed control, that is powered by USB. Awesome. Except for one little thing: to shut it off, you have to unplug it. There's no on/off switch. That is annoying after a while. I guess that would have raised the price a little, but I would have gladly paid a bit more for the convenience of a switch. Other than that, it works like a champ.
$review_summary.: Outstanding product, but no easy on/off switch

$review_text.: Very easy to set up and very robust.  Took a while to figure out all the features and apps as the manual seems written for more experienced networking/NAS users.  I use it to share files across my home network and also as a streaming server to my Droid phone via the Synology app.  A great solution at a great price, just remember its BYOD (bring your own drive).

$REVIEW.: It is cheaper than the ipad yes. There are however many draw backs to saving the money.1 if you are a mac family do not expect an easy transition into this tablets world.  The device does not sync to your Mac computers very well.  When you do get it to recognize the tablet managing it does not work very well.2  The Ads...this tablet has adds with every app or operation you try to use.  Very annoying.3  The expandable memory is very misleading.  You can add a micro chip to expand to 32 however this extra memory does not apply to APPS.If you can figure it out you can add Movies and Music to the extra memory but if you have kids that love playing with the apps then you arestuck with an 8 tablet.  You can fit about 6 games on it maybe.  You cannot remove the many " google" apps that as kids you will never use.We bought it for our kids and so far are super disappointed.We were lied to about being able to use our AMAZON PRIME membership with this device(you can only read books.  The device does not support AMAZONs streaming.It has a nice screen and when you can watch movies its a pretty picture.  So there I said something nice.I do not have a kindle fire but from my friends reviews they do not have the issues we have had with this tablet.You do get what you pay for.Update: After trying to make this work with the help of a Samsung rep we gave up.  The tablet is poorly designed.  We have returned them and gone with another tablet.We were very disappointed in everything about these tablets.  We are now stuck with the microSD cards and cases.

 icore 7 really heats up to 95C!I decided I needed "does the job" fan which would not make my wallet feel..sad?Everything in the reviews stated it was a weak item..that it seems to want to break if moved around


 ITS TRUE

 Just follow the reviews and dont move it around, also keep it in a flat surface because the fans are not protected..they get caught by cloth or what ever is bellow the area of placement.I decided to get this instead of the Cool Master X2 because of the price and the need.It cooled my laptop from 92C down to 85-80C and sometimes 75C
It just takes about an hour before the results were positive=]It may not seem like alot, but it makes a diffidence..now my computer doesn't shut off AND while playing games it doesn't lag because my icore doesn't slow down.I recommend this for someone who needs a quick fix to "computer shutting down" which I had.It has 3 fans..they arnt the strongest

 Wish it could blow more air..but it does the job.Anyways it was a GOOOD BUY..just hope it lasts long! I will put update when and how it breaks


*cross fingers* not any time soon i hope!Update: This is not something you put on your lap, ALSO I dont think it will fit a 17" laptop BUT you can place it on top and move the laptop to align it where the fans should give air to the laptop
(which is what i did with my 15" laptop

IT DOES THE JOB

 bang for the buck make the most outa cheap items i say!

I bought it because I used it in the store with my iPhone 4, and it sounded awesome. When I first brought it home, it worked great. The next time I used it the remote wouldn't work. Sometimes it would change the volume or source and power on/off, but I couldn't use it to change the radio station or change the song. The same day the sound kept going out. If the iPhone or system moved at all while the phone was docked, it lost connection. So when I would change the song on my iphone (because the remote nor the buttons on the dock worked) the sound would go out.Just today I started having a hard time getting it to charge. Like other reviews, I had to push really hard to get it to charge, and it would still stop charging after a few minutes. I honestly really liked the style, and I compared the sound to my brother's Bose side by side. You couldn't even tell a difference. It's a shame it's having all these problems. I've decided not to chance it and am returning it today.

$REVIEW.: My last headphones were over-ear closed Shure SRH440's.  I'm missing the sound isolation that those provided but I generally listen in a quiet environment where I am alone, so isolation is not really an issue.  Open phones like the HD 598 have a more natural sound quality.  I'm very pleased.My SRH440's were noisy over my ears if I moved my jaw.  The HD 598's are very quiet and also very comfortable.  It is very easy to forget that you have them on.  I often wear them for hours at a time and have never removed them just because my head/ears needed a break.What I love most about the HD 598's is the great frequency response.  They are very similar to my Mackie MR-8 studio monitors.  These headphones don't seem to &amp;#34;colour&amp;#34; the sound.  I especially dislike the overdone bass response on certain celebrity endorsed, (and more expensive) models, so the HD 598's were a welcome addition to my work place.These are wonderful headphones for general listen or mixing.  I would choose something else if you need something for recording and require isolation.

One was it makes it heavy, well you don't buy this case for it's slim light weight, you buy it for it's protection. Button sticking, mine is the latest version and I haven't had any issues and I have used it for several days now. The screen protector is great no bubbles to worry about or sticky stuff.

The quality is more than I'd expect for such a bag.  Normally, I'd expect to pay at least $70 for something like this.Despite how much I like it, I do wish a couple of things were different:1) The inserts provided (the two large ones) aren't really customizable to my needs.  They are stiff and set up so you have no choice about where in the pack your camera body sits.  I'd prefer to have my body sitting a little lower in the pack.2) The addition of a system to hold a monopod would be awesome.  If on the outside of the bag, perhaps on one side, a little hook at the bottom to rest the peg of a monopod, and a strap to secure the upper portion snugly to the bag.There are three slots inside one of the compartments for memory cards.  It's a nice idea, though I think I'd rather have a small  plastic case to protect my memory cards.The pack sits very nicely on my shoulders.  I can walk around with it on one shoulder, and it doesn't feel at all like it would slide off.  Other packs I have/used would slide, and I'd have to constantly adjust them.  This one doesn't move.I think you can't find a better bag for this price.Some have complained about having the Canon logo on it, worrying about thieves being drawn to it.  Boo hoo.  Everything has a logo on it; get over it.

Only 4 narrow screws are used in attachment to the wall.  I mounted it on my apartment wall, and when I remove it it should be easy to fill the holes so I don't get charged by the management company for destroying the wall.  Take your time in leveling before you drill.  I was a little off and had to use an allan wrench on one side (under the top hook) to raise the side a bit.  The packaging could be a bit less wasteful if they were to fully disassemble the back plate before boxing.  I was confused why it was pre-assembled because the instructions called for having to assemble it from 4 pieces.The free HDMI cable is a great bonus.  Best buy charges like $50 for these, which can be had for $10 online.This project took 2 trips to home depot.  I needed 16 5/16" washers for attaching the arms to the back of the TV (the included hardware, while extensive, didn't fit my application perfectly...the included M8 screws were a little long).  I could have bought 4 new 20 mm M8 screws to replace the 25 mm M8 screws; however, they only had 3 at home depot so I elected to go with washers instead.

 Corsair uses a wheel to raise and lower the sound

which makes it easy to quickly adjust the sound up and down

 I was able to walk about 25 feet before it started to break up.The headphones use a soft cloth, which is a nice touch.The build quality is questionable

I am not sure with they will hold up over time
 They do not feel sturdy to me
However, I did not reduce the rating for build quality because I have not had an issue.My issue with these headphones is they hurt my ears after 20 minutes

 I reduce the rating one star for this.

The night vision leaves a little to be expected but  that is to be expected.  This is by far hands down better than the cheap cameras that came with my system and I plan on purchasing more of these if the need arises.

I got it in a lightning deal so overall for the price that i paid i think it is a really great deal.

However, the traffic receiver version of the vehicle power cable was not included in my package.  It only contained the regular vehicle power cable and a USB power/data cable.

$REVIEW.: This KVM works well. It's simple and easy to set up. To address some of the other reviews on this product, I've had no issues waking up my PCs out of standby and it hasn't yet locked up on me. Nor have I found any issues with regards to video. Note that there is no audio support and no switching supported via key presses (you have to press the button on the unit itself). That said, it's a cheap, reliable product that does its job well.One caution though... take note that this product uses only 1 USB plug for each computer that it's hooked up with. Thus, it serves as a type of 2-port hub. This is very convenient in one sense, as it doesn't hog up your available USB ports. You just have to be sure that the port has enough power for the switch (which does light up when your computer is on), your keyboard, and the mouse. I have a Logitech Illuminated Keyboard and an iGesture Touchpad that I used with this device and I had a lot of issues initially with the Touchpad not being recognized or only working for a brief interval. What I discovered was that the power provided by my PC's USB port was not enough for both devices. If I disabled the lighting on my keyboard, both devices worked great... once I turn up the lighting, the touchpad became erratic and eventually stopped working. I was able to resolve the issue by piping the USB plug through a powered hub (thus ensuring there was maximum power going through the single plug) and the problem went away. The point being, that while this device is convenient b/c of it only requires 1 USB plug and no external power, just take note that this might not work directly if you have some sophisticated equipment.IOGear also has a similar looking KVM product with a remote switch that I recently purchased as well (seeIOGear GCS22U 2-Port USB KVM Switch). That product DOES have two separate USB plugs and thus, is not susceptible to the same issue. However, the remote is the only way to switch the connections and the nature of how that remote is connected scares me somewhat as it can be easily smashed or the cable can be easily frayed or cut. However, if the remote switch is important or you'd prefer dedicated plugs for both the keyboard and mouse to each PC, then that would be the better choice instead of the product reviewed here.Bottom line, for under </review_text><review_summary>for $35 this Light is amazing</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1HPC4BDRLR60"><latest_review_date>22/01/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0012JE3YM</product_id><review_date>22/01/2014</review_date><review_helpful>[2, 3]</review_helpful><review_text>for 79 dollars this product is truly amazing !the image can fill up a whole wall at night.

$REVIEW.: Even though this says its for the RX1, I took a chance and purchased it for the HX50v and it fits fine. I have a similar protector on my NEX5N.  The screen coating on many Sony models has a tendency to rub off over time, so a good screen protector is a must.  These protectors apply so much easier than most, because only the outer edges have adhesive, so you don't have to be as concerned about bubbles.

Designed to be small enough to fit on a shelf or the corner of a desk, it never the less has enough volume to clearly and completely carry music through a noisy room (say, during a party). It has the typical "modern style" look of being black with blue lighting accents, and also comes with a small remote for volume control (the volume buttons are also duplicated on the top of the device). Connection is done easily through one of three methods: traditional Bluetooth, NFC, or direct cable connection via an auxiliary port.I primarily use mine with my laptop, and have yet to have any issues. Initially connecting the device wirelessly took seconds, and it has played through hundreds of songs and videos now without a glitch. All I get is clear sound!An interesting note about the system: did you know it has ports? It has both an auxiliary-in port and a headphone port. Don't discount either of these - the "Aux-In" allows you to connect older or non-BT devices easily with a cord (like when you want to listen to your old iPod Shuffle mix); the headphone port not only allows you to connect headphones (if, say, you're in the office and want to be courteous to others), but also allows you to pass a signal through to other devices. You probably won't ever need to pass a signal through, but I have done it once.Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars. I have no complaints with this speaker system, and am very happy with it!

$REVIEW.: I just bought the Kingston RAM to update my Dell laptop from 1GB to 2GB... The memory install was a snap, repowered my laptop and the computer now sees 2GB... My computer is much faster...Kingston has been around for a while so I recognized the name in a good memory provider. I went to Fry's and they had a new brand called Centon, while cheaper, I had not heard anything about the brand. The salesman says it is a new brand and they do not know if people are having problems so for a few more dollars I bought Kingston (a brand that I know about).Most, of the negative reviews, seem to be of the variety of being shipped the wrong memory and not the product performance and/or reliability. I bought this same RAM in a store and know that it is a 1GB DIMM...Update:I also updated the memory in an old Dell desktop from 1GB to 2GB with the PC3200 Kingston chip...In replacing the desktop and laptop I noticed that both machines were getting a lot hotter. The laptop felt much warmer and the desktop had this foul heat smell... I did some searching on Google and there were some issues with the vendors that Kingston is specifying and their chips do get hot... It seems that there is also a similar issue in Samsung memory as well (they used similar or the same vendors)...I decided to replace all of the Kingston chips with Corsair and the computers while warmer were not that hot and the smell went away on the Dell desktop.If I was creating a new review I would give it at most a two since there was a product defect (which can lead to frying parts or a fire hazard). I wanted to like this product; I know the name but this is a serious issue...

They come with a great durable travel/storage bag made of a thick vinyl, an adapter plug that unscrews to fit both the small and larger inputs.I might not know a lot about impedance ratings, etc ... but I do know these headphones sound great, are durable and the swivel ear cup provides a good option for a DJ or just a regular listener like myself who needs to keep an ear open for other things like a telephone or whatever.  When the phones are on, they comfortably encompass the entire ear without being super clunky.  They have a cool, sleek look and have enough durability to travel over and over.Great for everything from studio monitoring, listening to an MP3, etc.  I love these phones!

$review_text.: I like these a lot.  The audio clarity is pretty good for the price.  They produce plenty of bass.  As a closed design they do a decent job blocking minor external noise.  They're a big step up from bargain-basement headphones.Their main drawbacks are:The bass is unnaturally strong.  This could be a plus but you may need to play with your equalizer.They can get hot and uncomfortable if worn for over an hour or so.I had to replace the cable after a few years.  Fortunately it can be replaced separately from the main unit.

 This little antenna, mounted on a ten foot pole gets us great reception on all the important broadcast channels with transmitters located about 10 miles away

$REVIEW.: Ok, overall it's a good router, looks really good, easy to set up, but I wish I would knew one fact before I bought it. Even that it says it's a dual band, you can operate only one band at a time. Wireless b/g can only be operated at 2.4Ghz, so does a/n, but at 5Ghz no b/g support, only a/n. So if you set up for Wireless N, it works great with your PC, but if you have iPhone/Touch, or PS3 using wireless internet, only have b/g support you out of luck. So in my case, if I knew this before, I would rather paid more and bought DIR-855 model. For those that don't know 2.4Ghz band is slower, and in most cases over crowded.

The cost is right, the quality is what you would expect (see below), and the pictures are stunning. Complements my 5D mkII and 40D perfectly, and seems like a reasonable merging of the two. Although a new user might feel comfortable, I would recommend this camera to those with experience in photography. Fantastic camera, glad I bought it!The details: I'm going to start with what I don't like first. Keep in mind that none of these are significant and do not affect my enjoyment of the camera a bit. They are small things that I've noticed, though. First, the build quality is slightly below what I would expect. I have no doubt that the camera is rugged, but I'm used to feeling the sturdiness of a camera in my hands. When i first picked it up, it seemed too light and plasticy to hold up to regular use and the occasional bump. But it's worked fine and the plastic is necessary for the GPS and Wi-fiSecond, although it's made by Canon, there are some small user interface differences between this and previous models. You may at first turn it on and think, &amp;#34;Wait, where's that setting I used to love?&amp;#34; It's there, but it's likely buried, accessed via a counterintuitive route, or on the opposite end of the camera! But, after a few minutes of messing around you'll be fine navigating all that the camera offers.So, onto the good and great:Image quality: Surprise! It is amazing. It is leaps and bounds above my 40D (likely due in part to the full frame), significantly better than my old 5D, and I would say marginally better than my 5D mk II. Obviously this last comparison is debatable and can actually be ignored entirely; both produce stunning images that are only slightly different upon unusual inspection. If you're used to a point-and-shoot or worse, your cell phone camera, you'll probably cry a little once you see the images this thing takes. They're sharp naturally, without post-processing. The exposure is sometimes a tad off, but it's still better than most bodies I've used.Low-light: I found out by accident how capable this camera was of taking low-light images. After opening the camera the night I received it, clicked the shutter by accident and was blown away by the image it produced. The ISO was not cranked to the max and the lens was not particularly open. I've added the image to show what I mean. On my previous cameras, those shadows in such low light would have been indecipherable. This is my go-to when out for an evening shoot.UI: As mentioned, there is a slight learning curve. Canon moved some things around, I think to keep up with modern conventions, so if you're coming from a previous Canon body you might have to take some time to learn where all the important settings are. But once you find them, they're easy to remember. Buttons, dials, etc., are all self-explanatory.Specs: On paper the camera is impressive. All of its features add up to a wonderful photography experience. Low-light noise handling, the autofocus, dynamic range, ISO, shutter speed, and general speed are all superb thanks to the powerful processor. The viewfinder is clear and encompassing. You can crop in-camera and the battery lasts plenty.Bells and Whistles: This thing has them. They were not a primary concern for me, but after a month of heavy use I can say I'm glad they're there. The Wi-fi and GPS enablement is a time-saver and appreciated nicety. The latter is becoming increasingly popular with online photo sites, so it's just something cool to have built-in.The magic: The processor and focus mechanisms in this thing are unparalleled. There are times where I would normally switch into manual focus to get the right feel to the picture, but this camera predicts with 90% accuracy what I intended. When shooting complex subjects with multiple textures, the camera accurately selects what I would have focused on. And beyond just focusing on faces of human subjects, it targets specifically their eyes. It's wonderful.This camera is amazing. If you've been contemplating this for a while and have had trouble justifying the cost or have been switching between this and other bodies but have yet to make a decision, but it. If you stumbled across this and are considering it for an expensive impulse buy, buy it. If you have a significant other still using an earlier body and want to help them step up their game, buy it. You will not regret it.

$REVIEW.: I ordered these to go with a Harmon Kardon receiver (AVR 1700) I found on a great clearance sale at Best Buy. They look beautiful, and I have no complaints about the sound. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I like my movies to sound good, and these are night-and-day different to listening to my television's built in speakers, or even my old hundred-dollar sound bar I bought a couple years ago at Radio Shack. I'm not advanced enough in my knowledge of good speakers to evaluate the sound quality in more fine detail than that, but I have never had a situation where I thought they were lacking.  Oh, and the fact that 5.1 surround sound includes a center channel speaker that prioritizes dialogue means that I no longer have the issue where I have to turn the movie up WAY TOO LOUD for a few seconds to hear a quiet piece of dialogue. I love that.My only complaint was the speaker wire inputs. These spring clips are cheaply made. You'll read the same thing in several other reviews on here, but I'll throw my hat into the ring on this one. Five of the six speakers, no problems. But on the second one I wired up, the clip just crumbled under my thumb as I pulled it back against its spring. I have small hands, and I was not rough with it by any stretch of the imagination. Just using the amount of muscle needed to compress the spring was too much for that particular clip.Now, Polk was great and immediately shipped out two replacement sets of spring clips (even though only one speaker was broken), along with some quick verbal instructions about how to replace them myself. I asked about taking the speaker in for service, but the shipping wouldn't have been covered under warranty, so I thought I'd take a crack at it. It sounds simple, but it was VERY difficult to get the speaker apart to replace the clips. I am posting this in the hopes that it will help someone else who has to do this in the future.The face of the speaker was easy enough to remove, as were the screws underneath the rubber seats for the posts on the faceplate (these had to be carefully removed from the speaker, by the way, before the screws were visible). However, the two halves of the speaker absolutely would not even BUDGE against each other. Trying to pry them apart with a small screwdriver was only resulting in putting gouges into the plastic of the speaker.I put in another call to Polk to resolve this, and eventually the CS rep went and got his hands on an actual speaker to take it apart. He came back and said he had the exact same problem, solved by (get this!) wrapping the speaker in a layer of cloth for protection and WHACKING IT AGAINST THE WORKBENCH! He said this loosened it right up and suggested I do the same. I got his assurance that if this broke the speaker, they would replace it for me. Then I went home and did like he said... gave it a good solid whack against my carpeted floor. And wouldn't you know it, a couple whacks and the two halves slid right apart. No damage, easily replaced the spring clips, and we're back in business. That speaker now sounds just as good as the rest. So if you have to take this apart to replace the spring clips, wrap it in something soft and strike it firmly (don't smash the heck out of it!) against a hard surface until you hear the halves pop apart.I would buy these again, but the flimsiness of the clips was a little disappointing.

$REVIEW.: This lens is sharp, fast, and autofocuses on all Nikon DSLRs
 The autofocus motor is louder than most AF-S motors, but it's not actually bothersome.Compared to the Nikon 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 (which I've borrowed), this lens is about a stop faster, doesn't make it quite as wide (only goes to 11), and, subjectively, has less distortion.This is a great wide angle lens and, due to the fast f/2.8 aperture, it is easily the best for night sky photography.

$review_text.: I was hesitant to try these decals, but I have to say that they are wonderful. Before applying, thoroughly clean your workspace (a glass tabletop works great), because the underside of the decal will attract any tiny speck of dust or pet hair (and you will NOT be able to remove it) and it will be visible under the decal. Follow the instructions and the decals are actually very easy to apply. Some people claim to have been able to remove them and store them in the original packaging. I had no such luck. One tore on an upper, inner corner, and another stretched out of shape. I would not consider these reusable.

$review_text.: I can understand the need to make some cuts in a budget tablet and could live with no flash for the camera. But haptic feedback (vibration alerts) is an integral feature in all versions of Android and one we expect the hardware to support. Of all things, why would Asus leave this out? And this is not always spelled out in the specs, so you have to go beyond the specs and research each individual feature that you assume is there for any tablet you want to buy. Lack of haptic feedback on this tablet is a complete disqualification as far as I am concerned. Same with the Dell Venue 8.UPDATE: had to change from 2 stars to 3 to be fair. It seems most other manufacturers are leaving haptic feedback off of all but very premium tablets. Even the new Galaxy Tab PRO 8.4 does not have it.

$review_text.: I've been using Pinnacle for over a decade, upgrading regularly. But I'm done with it now.I downloaded the patch to upgrade Release 17.4 to Release 17.5. It came with a free plug-in for SonicFire. The patch installed, but the plug-in for SonicFire would not.When I tried to get support from Pinnacle for the failed installation, they invited me to purchase a support ticket. Hello? That's a hidden-fee or installation charge. You have to pay them to fix their mistakes.Three times I got the same canned message that &amp;#34;if there's a product defect, there will be no charge&amp;#34; -- followed by instructions for purchasing a support ticket.I could not get through to a human being. I could not get a human being to acknowledge that they sent out a defective patch/plug-in installation.As far as I'm concerned, their customer support is worse than incompetent -- it's deliberately rude.Based on this experience, I can only assume that Corel/Pinnacle doesn't understand public relations very well. It looks to me that they see their customers as nothing more than cash cows to be milked.I did finally solve my problem. I uninstalled it and switched to Adobe Premiere Pro. The learning curve is a little steep, but I trust Adobe a lot more than Corel/Pinnacle.

Both look and material are very good

The case fits a full size micro ATX mb, 1 5.25" disc drive and 1 3.5" hard drive
Instruction is quite simple, 1 sheet of paper but enough for setup with some trial-and-error

Optical disc drive may use 3rd screw hole so there won't be a gap between eject switch and push mechanism on case


I use 2nd hole and put a self adhesive furniture bumper to fill the gap.The primary issue is the noisy PS unit


This can be solved some by swapping an aftermarket fan


Go buy a 2 bucks silent 80x80x25mm fan, remove the PS from case (3 screws), remove its top cover (4 screws)
You will see the PS fan uses 2 wires, red and black

Your 2 bucks fan may come with a 3-pin connector in red/yellow/black wires or an ATX 4pin peripheral connector with red and black

If it's the 3 pin, the yellow is not used and you don't need soldering
Just pop the pins and insert them to PS fan's connector
Or, you do little soldering if it's a red/black 4pin fan
Black to black, red to red
Otherwise it will short and get burnt


However, this fan swap needs to rip off the warranty sticker so 1 year warranty is no more

If you prefer not to change internal parts, google for a micro ATX PS which this case uses

SilenX has a 200W silent PS for 10 bucks.But no matter you change fan or replace the whole PS the noise is only reduced to an acceptable level, not eliminated
This is due to the air flow design of the case


Intake is on bottom and space for air flow is limited
If you want a very silent case with small footage, go with Antec NSK1380 but in some cost.Cute, not very noisy(after modify on PS), fit for standard DVD and MATX MB, low cost
Really not too much to criticize.

I needed approximately 60 feet of cable but the only offering on Amazon from this company that I found was 50 and 100 feet.  I ordered the 100 foot length.  When I went to install the antenna the instructions stated that I may need an amplifier for any length over 50 feet.  After the connection and setup my high definition reception with 100 feet was as good as what I was receiving with cable.  I only wish there was a greater selection of lengths offered on Amazon.

$review_text.: I have a Panasonic 37" LCD TV and wanted to improve the sound. Originally I purchased a Panasonic SCH-TD10 Sound bar that coordinates with it. After listening to it for a couple of years, I was still unimpressed with the sound and looked for an alternative. This sound bar had mainly terrific reviews and Klipsch is known for making terrific speakers (back in the day). I installed this and was very disappointed. The sound seemed no better. I removed it from its mount and placed it in front of my TV and alternated playing TV program sound and music from the two speakers. Other than the better base from this sound bar, I heard virtually no difference. I then did the same with the Panasonic Bar and found little difference but some improvement so I returned this bar. I'm now pretty impressed with the TV's speakers and soundThe bar had some problems as well. The AV wire that comes with it is very flimsy and didn't work. I had to use the wire from my Panasonic Bar. The remote controller would not work, occasionally, and I had to turn the bar off at the bar and turn it back on in order for the remote to work.One last feature, or lack of, which bothered me and which may be common to most bars, is that the bar has to be mounted in an open area as the remote's infra red has to be able to reach the bar's receptor. While the bar can be programmed to accept a Universal remote, it has to read that remote directly. Also, there are two volume controls, one for the main speakers and one for the sub and the universal remote has only one volume control so that you need to keep the Bar remote handy if you want to adjust the sub or other features.Since my Panasonic bar was built to coordinate with a Panasonic TV and has a cable with a connector similar to a USB cable connector, the Bar takes its commands from the TV and can be placed in more remote locations.

Much cheaper than having to replace a screen. It was easy to put on as long as you follow the great instructions provided. Maily making sure your screen is very clean before you attempt to put it on. If you have any dust on your screen it can get trapped leaving a bubble in that area that cannot be corrected since the dust then sticks to the screen protector.

$review_text.: Pro:- Great sound. I am sure there are higher quality headphones made by Monster, but compared to other companies that make headphones in this price range (that I have tried) these are hands down the best- Rubber earplugs stay on! I have gone through pair after pair that kept loosing those damn little rubber plug thingys. It drives me insane. These ones stay on even though I am constantly pulling them in and out of my pocket- Great Cables that are thin and don't snag / stick to everything they tough. I have used others where I felt like if they even got close to something just seemed to stick and pull them out of my ears. These are thing, smooth and durable- Work for Phone Calls. I use mine on my Android phone everyday. They are not specifically designed for it, or call it out in the specs I have noticed. Microphone works great, better than others that spec they are phone capable.- Great Customer Service. They offered to replace my pair that I broke without a problem. And honestly, I broke them by running past something and they snagged. It wasn't a question of the cables being weak.Cons:- Phone calls are great as I said, only odd thing is every now and then on a random phone call, I get these occasional noises that cut through. It is random and doesn't happen often, but I would say it happens on 1 out of 50 calls, maybe 1 out of 100- Weight: I do have to say these do weigh a bit more in your ear. But, its still 100% comfortable. And because it is designed well, they don't fall out any more often than other brands I have tried.Overall:I highly recommend these headphones. I wouldn't let the con's I listed leave a bad taste in your mouth. For the price they are awesome and I love them. You will be very happy with these, and they will out last other pairs. With the added benefit saving extra cash in the long run because you don't have to buy new rubber pieces (like you do with other brands).

$review_text.: I am giving this item five stars solely because of the ease and speed with which Amazon permitted me to return the item. I purchased the item through one of the &amp;#34;warehouse deals&amp;#34; and it was used or &amp;#34;repackaged&amp;#34;. I never figured out the problem, but it appeared that the driver program which was supposed to be installed internally in the device was not present. In any event, my computer could not &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; or recognize the device as it was supposed to do, and I could not get it installed. As a result, I sent it back, and quickly received a full refund, including the postage spent on the return. I then purchased from Amazon a 1TB WD portable external hard drive, similar in size and appearance, for only $5 more, and it worked perfectly.  I'm sort of glad the 500 gb device did not work.

$REVIEW.: I have tried 3 other FM transmitters, and this one is by far the best - and the most expensive

I agree with others that using the Pro setting seems to make the reception better

 I did notice in areas some static and touching the unit made the static go away


 Since I did not want to drive with one hand on it, I leaned a small metal rod on the unit that I just happened to have in the front seat
 It had the same affect as my hand, but a lot safer

 I will keep some metal wire under the seat and lean it against the unit if I hit some static again.

The sound quality is much better than any &amp;#60;$50 in ear headphones I've tried and they fit in my ear very well. They came packaged with a set of 3 ear sizes and I'm sure that should cover most people's size preference. They are by far the most comfortable in ear headphones I've owned.These do a really good job blocking noise as well. I wear them under my motorcycle helmet when I ride to block out wind noise, and they do a decent job keeping me from going deaf. When I'm just riding casually I'll play some music through them and I don't have to max out the volume to hear the music like I do through other headphones I've used.  They have a low profile and don't get shoved into my ears under the helmet. It slides on and off right over them, which is very nice when getting ready to ride.

This Sony DSC HX5V was not on the market yet when I chose my camera.  I would be hard pressed to decide between the two now.

$review_text.: Connects my 30gb iPod classic or my iPhone to my 2010 BMW 328i with no problems


 The BMW audio does not support podcasts so I have been making 'smart playlists' in iTunes to play weekly updated podcasts
 Playback, control and charging all work great with this cable

 Quality appears good, at least for the first 3000 miles!UPDATE after 5 months: Slowly, over the past two weeks this connector has died
 It started by only playing some tracts on the complete list


 Then it would play none of the tracts


 Then it stopped recognizing an ipod altogether
 I have tried multiple iPhones and iPods now to no avail
 Not sure how a passive connector can die like this but, like so many others reviewed here, it did.

First, there may be some people who don't know how to set up a bluetooth connection properly, and they need to get some help, because this is a great little keyboard and case. If you still have troubles, once it is set up correctly, then you likely have a bad unit and should return it for a good one. This types and protects wonderfully.Next, do NOT expect this (plus the iPad2) to be a laptop.  Some reviewers seem to think that all they need to have a good laptop is to get a keyboard.  No, not even close. Most tablets are designed to be, well, tablets.  Extra light and small Mobile computing platforms for doing light computing tasks, especially for times that a full computer (laptop, whether Mac or PC) is not needed. By definition, it is not going to work or act like a full laptop... in other words, I don't run Final Cut Pro on the iPad, nor do I want to. This product WILL allow you to type up emails and word processing documents (if you have the apps, obviously) like a dream.  I rarely get a letter that doesn't "connect" right while typing. But, no, this is NOT the same as having a laptop... it is better in some ways and it is worse in some ways. I use a notebook computer and an iPad and I bring along the one that makes the most sense for what I will be doing (software wise). I am shocked how often it is the iPad2.In addition, make sure you are ordering the newer product if you have the iPad2 (its worth the extra 6 bucks)as the fit will not be good with the iPad2 if you buy Kennsington's iPad1 case... it won't be snug.  Personally, I don't mind taking the iPad2 out of the case for pictures or video, but (of course) with the correct case you won't need to do so.Lastly, ask yourself if you really NEED a bluetooth keyboard for your iPad?  If you type a lot, you are going to love it. But if you only type on a rare occasion, you will find a thinner case and the virtual iPad keyboard will be more fitting for you.  I really like this case, obviously, but it is the right thing for me. If you understand that this product will not give you a full PC or MacBook Pro notebook, then you too will love this nice little devise and case.

And I am happy :-)A few sidenotes here, I forced the Pre-N router to operate on channel 11 and the WirelessG router to operate on channel 1 to avoid each other as much as possible.  Also I could've went with an access point vs. a second router, but it provides a nice double firewall and keeps prying family eyes out of my business.  Plus my only other Belkin choice would be their 7130 access point, but it is an older device, and has received some questionable reviews.  The 7130 also supposedly doubles as an ethernet adapter (or bridge) in conjunction with other Belkin products only, but there does not appear to be a Site Survey incorporated to survey the wifi signals in the surrounding area.  The 7330 does incorporate this feature!When speed testing a PC wired to my WirelessG router, I get speeds of 3.0Mbps which is the best Time Warner Cable of Hawaii is doing right now, (even though they are claiming 5.0).  So this speedy signal is twisting it's way through each of my 3 Belkin devices with ease!  And never SLOWS DOWN!  It's a home network enthusiasts dream, man!Happy Wireless Networking!

$REVIEW.: The benefits of an extra battery are obvious, so I won't bother telling you why to buy one
OEM batteries are the way to go I say

Sure, you pay a premium, but they work right and you know they will be compatible


I noticed some users saying the OEM batteries do not last very long, but having used these in 2 different cameras, an EP-2 and an EPM-1, my experience is that the camera makes an enormous difference
The EP-2 would not last long, but the same battery seems to last forever in the EPM-1, so just consider that as a factor


What else can I say..

it's a battery, it's well made, and it is awesome to have when your camera dies in the middle of an outing!



$review_summary.: Works right..

a good thing to have.

$review_text.: I just bought this router refurbished from linksys to upgrade from my WRTG54 (which I believe was one of the best routers of all time), and it came in a box like it was brand new. The packaging would make you swear it was bought off a store shelf brand new. It was clean, scratch free, and finger print free. The router itself had a clear protective plastic cover adhered to the surface, and the Ethernet cable was wrapped and twist tied twice.Now it says on the box to run the disc before hooking up cables, this isn't true. If you connect your modem directly to the router, you'll have internet access within seconds. The disc does help with initial setup, but I've been setup routers and networks for years, so I just went straight to the control panel in my browser. To access the control panel, just go to your favorite web browser and type 192.168.1.1 That's the default gateway to the router's preference panel. If it asks for a username and password, just type "admin" for both, without the quotation marks.Over all, this router is fast! I was able to transfer large files between computers on my network at blazing fast speeds. With the power of wireless N now, the range and coverage of the wifi is a lot greater. I was able to get WiFi in rooms of the house I wasn't able to before. Rooms that had low signals now show full bars and a strong signal.Design was, the body has been slimmed down and made a sexy glossy black. The new icons and blue LED display on the top of the router is also a nice new refresh. The router is also lacking external antennas which is also nice, dont have to worry about those getting whacked into weird directions and positions by the cat anymore.I also liked the refreshed GUI of the settings. They're nearly identical to the layout of the WRTG54G, but made a bit more simpler and friendlier for those new to playing with the settings of their router.Definitely recommend the refurbished model over the new one!

$review_text.: This is a nice sized mp3 player that is small thin and light. The screen is fairly clear but nothing like apple products. This is great for the gym or a young child who isn't old enough to have a super expensive iPod.I like the FM radio option and the clarity was really good. The overall sound of this small mp3 player was surprisingly good. I did find that scrolling thru the menu's to get to mp3, video, photos, FM were a bit weird.So why is there no mac support? well you can actually load music on it as if it was a usb drive but its clearly not geared for mac, only windows. This isn't for someone who has or had an iPod because they won't like it but for a young kid or to have something inexpensive to travel or take to the gym its perfect. I wouldn't be worried if I dropped it, its light and I don't think it would break like an iPod would.The biggest perk about this is the FM radio.

Compared to my old Nikon D40, it was really convenient not having to swap out lenses all the time. Saved a TON of hiking with the 42x zoom. Found out the digital zoom only works with the switch on the lens, not the one on the shutter button - but trying to photograph anything at that distance is going to require a tripod or other stabilization equipment (like the railing of a cruise ship). Also doesn't take up as much space as my old D40 and two lenses.

$REVIEW.: Yes, that's correct - component (not composite) video


 A lot of folks don't realize, or go into a store and become sold on expensive cables that specifically perform to a single standard, but regular RCA cables designed for audio will successfully deliver component video signals


 Perhaps several years ago, there was a dire need to reduce interference and electrical noise by buying shielded cables and expensive surge protectors


 Today, most equipment inherently account for these variations and have their own filters and clipping circuits built in
 However, if you live within ten feet of a power substation, or happen to be running huge inductive loads like an electric furnace that a person could walk in - then you might have to worry
 Otherwise, don't fret :o)A pack of these connectors will cost you less than a standard component video cable, and allow you to upgrade ones you already own if space becomes limited behind your device


This was the case with us after purchasing a new television and mounting it to the wall, only to realize we still had to use some of the rear-facing connections


 We popped these adapters on the end of the existing cable and viola - turned it into a low-profile cable that routes perfectly in a tiny space.Quality is good - what does that mean?  Sometimes, when a seller offers a product like this in bulk, it's because that person bought someone else's scrap product that is too loose, too tight, or has a bad or shorted connection, etc
 It happens more often than you think...particularly on popular auction websites
 Fortunately, that isn't the case here

 The connections we made are tight, the conductive plating is not discolored or flaking, and the end result is a clear and high definition picture from the source device
 Top rating and review are deserved.I feel confident writing this and recommending the product to others


 Please feel free to add comments or questions and I'll do my best to help.

When the 5D Mark III is set to 1080p at 30fps and Low Compression (intra frame, ALL-I) AND my aperture is f/4.0 or higher I hit the buffer limit very quickly and the recording stops.  So in short the card cannot keep up with the write speed of the large files.  I cannot recreate this problem in any other camera then again I don't own anything else that records at that high a quality and low compression.  I have this card and lots more compared on my website - the number of shots in JPEG and RAW that you can get in a 10 second burst is almost as high as the Extremes in the T4i.

$REVIEW.: I got the leather smart cover when I bought my iPad2, but nothing for the back, since up to this point I've just laid it down face down when setting it somewhere.  So I wanted to get something finally, since I had a nice case for my first generation iPad that I've been using for a while and liked the idea of protecting the back on the new one as I did the first.I don't use an apple dock for my iPad2, so I didn't have to worry about something that would fit when docked.  I have a third party Griffin metal stand that I use for charging that just has the room in it for the plug to be manually plugged in (i.e. it's not attached to the stand) and it has plenty of room for a shell on the iPad and still allow it to fit.The pictures really don't do this justice.  It just looks and feels great.  When I was first putting it on, I was kind of wondering if it was even going to hold, since it just BARELY reaches around enough at the corners to snap into place, but it did.  And during all my normal use and holding positions, it stays just fine.  I can see if someone grips from the corner, and presses against the lip of this where it's gripping the edge of the corner, you can push it off, but when I try to do it intentionally, I have to make sure my thumb is pressing pretty much ONLY on that thin piece of plastic, with no pressure on the surface of the iPad itself, because even just a little bit of my thumb on the glass surface, and that's enough to keep me from having enough pressure on the case to snap it off.  So for me, it just can't come off without me trying from the way I hold it.As far as operation with the smart cover, flawless.  It fit just fine, and doesn't keep the cover from closing at all, or opening.  Even where the plastic covers the right edge, it's easy to get at the smart cover to lift, and if you have problems, there's the opening where the gap is for the volume and slider switch, so getting the smart cover pulled away from its magnetically closed position is very easy.  The only drawback is, as with just about every cover out there, the slight magnetism between the cover and the back of the iPad that helps keep the cover from falling away when it's "open" and behind the iPad is interfered with by the cover, since it's not close enough to the iPad now for that magnetism to work.  But for me that's not a concern simply because of how I hold it in either orientation, the cover won't fall away and dangle.Got a good grip to it without being too sticky like some of the silicone skins out there are, and not nearly as slippery as the bare metal of the back of the iPad when its naked.  Feels solid and secure in my hands.All in all an outstanding solution, and for the discounted price, a steal.Edit  16 April 2012I treat my iPads very well.  I don't even "drop" them a foot onto a couch or bed when I'm reading.  They don't get crammed into my laptop bag.  But the corners of this thing started cracking and breaking anyway within about four months.  Finally a few days ago the final straw was cracked, and it wouldn't hold on at all anymore (up to this point it had tiny bits of the top two corners left that were enough to at least hold it to the iPad).  I didn't take it off and put back on, so it wasn't stress from removing  or anything.  Just cracks that appeared after very very careful use.  Replaced it with a different type that's hopefully a little tougher than this one.

FM radio works well on wired headphones only because you need the wire for an antenna. Now this product would of gotten 5 starts except that it does not accept the latest playlists. It only accepts .pla playlists and they are only used on old windows players. Maybe there is a firmware upgrade, but I don not know. So since it has a Micro SD slot, I own a couple Micro SD's (they are cheap now) and I transfer my hard rock songs on one, classic guitar on another etc. And then I play the Micro SD card I want. Or you can do what the other reviewer suggests, retag your songs with MP3 tag software and this insignia will load them in a certain folder.

$review_text.: It is made out of material that appears to be cardboard (cheap).  I felt like I was going to bend it or ripe it when I put it together.  It is too small to really calibrate at distances that need to be used.  It is way too expensive, $29 to $39 more appropriate for the material it is made from. It will most likely sit in a drawer and gather dust.The only advantage of feeling like I've been taken advantage of, is to be able to hopefully warn someone who will read these reviews a little more carefully than I did.

However, when I was at school or at a meeting and needed to plug in my MacBook Pro into a projector, I was out of luck if I did not have my adapter.  So I purchased this one to keep in my laptop bag, so regardless of where I am or if I remembered to take my adapter with me, I can hook my MacBook Pro to a projector or other VGA device.  I purchased this one over purchasing another Apple branded one since the Apple one is $30, which is kind of high.  This one resembles the Apple branded one with two exceptions, the VGA connector is outside of the plastic (sticking up outside of the box, the Apple one is inside), and the white box is a bit fatter than the Apple one (the part that hooks to your VGA cable).  The packaging that mine came in looked just like the Apple on, just without an Apple picture on it.

I wanted a "folio" style case that also had built-in capability to act as a stand with multiple viewing angles, and this has fit the bill nicely.  The iPad fits snugly into the case with two elastic bands folding over the internal corners.  Easy access to all controls and inputs.  A couple of notes:Viewing "stand":  The design has four pairs of horizontal ridges on the internal face of the left folio cover that is used to hold the ipod in the various viewing positions.  Nice design that works well as long as the iPad is on a solid surface or is supported equally on both sides (eg. it does not work well if you but the case on just one leg while sitting down as the edges of the case bend down and the iPad will not stay standing, but if in your lap with each side of the case on one of your legs, it is perfect).Material:  While well-designed, it is not the highest quality material.  No animal lost hide in the making of this case!  And while it looks good (I bought the black case), it certainly does not match the high style of the iPad.

Their phones and tablets (and TVs) have been nothing short of amazing. And the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is no exception.Despite the similar weight and measurements to the original Galaxy Tab 7.0, the Plus is a completely different tablet. The bulky and squarish designs are gone. The Plus now resembles the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which is still the best looking Android tablet in my opinion. It's very light and thin. The screen is fantastic with the right amount of saturation and contrast. Very responsive as a touchscreen as well.A big bonus is the Infrared Transmitter which transforms your tablet into a great all-in-one remote with the right software. I tried Samsung's pre-installed software and while it does work great, it's a bit slow. Perhaps there are better alternatives on the market.So we know the Plus is a great tablet, but is the operating system up to snuff? Well, yes and no. It's running Honeycomb, so at least we're not using an antiquated phone OS on a tablet. Everything's in high resolution as it should be. However, HC is not Ice Cream Sandwich. There's no support for hardware acceleration. At times, the OS can be quite sluggish and unresponsive. The good news? This can be easily fixed with an ICS update from Samsung. The bad news? Samsung are well-known for their poor and slow update roll-out. It's been over half a year since ICS was officially released and their flagship devices (AT&amp;T; GSII, Galaxy Tab 10.1 etc) are still waiting for an update. Yes, it will come, but might still take a while.Another big question is whether or not anybody should still buy this tablet now that there are cheaper alternatives? Maybe... The Kindle Fire and Nook are in in a different class since unless you're willing to hack your devices, you won't get a true Android experience. They also lack GPS and expansion slots. Now the only available competitor is Samsung's very own Galaxy Tab 2.0, which is at least $50 cheaper (I actually got my Plus for $270 so it's not really a big deal). Even if the price difference was minimal, I think I would pick the Galaxy Tab 2.0 this time around. Why? It comes with ICS out of box. That is its selling point. ICS is just so much better than any previous Android release. That being said, if you can pick up the Plus for less than the 2.0, it's still a great deal. The Plus is slightly lighter, and slightly faster processor. ICS update WILL come.OVERALL: 4 stars! 5 had Samsung released ICS sooner.
$review_summary.: Great hardware. Not so great support.

It's not real leather which is an issue with me as I actually wanted real leather! The screen protector was scratched before I even put it on

The screen protector was stiff, it didn't fit right and the more you tried to get the bubbles out the more you got


I ended up throwing the screen protector in the garbage

But I must say I was really surprised at the quality of the videos and the stills I capture with my ACDSee software. It's also very nicely made, not cheap. It's so small and light that it adds no weight at all to my hand bag. I did get the extra battery and stand alone charger for nearly $50 more. The battery is about the same size as my mobile phone battery. It comes with a USB extension cord for use with a desktop computer, and a clear rubbery sleeve/case. It's really nice. At this price, I'd buy them for gifts.* You do have to hold the camera as steady as possible, but the quality of the video is still good, even if a little jumpy while walking around and recording. I was concerned about the lack of stabilizer when I ordered the camera, but the video is a lot better than I expected. And, as I mentioned, the stills I capture are good size 2.6mb files, decent enough quality for a 5x7 print.* I never installed the software that came with the camera. I have so many graphic software packages already on my computer, and because this camera captures in a compatible format and the files are in AVI format, all my current software is able to view and edit the video files.* I find the camera easy to hold, especially with the sleeve that it comes with. The very first time I touched the control buttons, they did move faster than I expected, but not so that it took any time to get use to.

$review_text.: Amazon says this is exactly what I purchased last time, and I've tried very hard to make sure I bought a genuine Panasonic part, not a cheapo clone. This time I was disappointed that two of the metal clips which hold the bulb to the plastic frame were not installed. They were flopping around loose inside the packaging, and with some long needlenose pliers and a lot of patience I got them were they should have been, using my old one as a guide. (Being very careful not to touch the glass, only the plastic frame) A reputable factory would not send out something that's not finished this way. Now it's in and works, but I question if it's a genuine Panasonic and if it will perform to spec for brightness (the primary reason to choose this projector over others) and bulb longevity.

$review_text.: I am so glad I purchased this projector! I bought a 110in screen and a sound bar to go along with it
I hooked my Playstation3 up to it and movies and games look amazing! I tell everyone that I built a movie theater and when they see it they are all jealous! I have been showing off my &amp;#34;Life of Pi&amp;#34; BluRay and a bunch of horror movies to everyone and they find it very impressive


The amazing scenery in &amp;#34;Life of Pi&amp;#34; looks so surreal and when something jumps out in a horror film it actually makes you jump versus not so much on a normal TV
After seeing how clear and vibrant the picture looks, you will be so glad you did not spend MUCH more on a different projector


I've seen them priced all the way up into the thousands, what a joke!

The locking pin that is attached to the laptop will not latch if the slot is recessed in any way on the laptop


 That excludes many HP laptops as they have placed the slot in a framed square on the side of the laptop, The ridges on the square a only 1/16-1/8&amp;#34; in height, but this is enough to cause the locking mechanism not to latch on the pin
 Wish the pin was 1/16-1/8&amp;#34; longer!

I am commenting to share that having this lens as opposed to needing two has greatly expanded my enjoyment for this great hobby of photography-- even more than I expected when I bought it. I am ready for anything all the time and am getting many shots I would have missed because changing lenses, if I even had them both, is such a pain and takes so long. What you give up is very little compared to what you gain. After decades of periodically improving my equipment I feel I have reached the photo promised land.

$REVIEW.: This has been a great thing- my daughter LOVES it!  Works great and has held up over the past year just fine


Great picture and sound as well

 Easy to work from the unit, no remote necessary really (of course, we have a small car..

I suppose it you wanted to control it from a third seat or something, the remote would come in handy)
 We just take a string (like a shoestring) and tie the unit (wrapped around where it hinges) directly to the headrest..
works great and doesn't stick out too far

 If you have a small car like us, don't waste your money on a case mount or anything

 Just get a string!

A few loose pieces to put together the stand, easy enough to figure out for most, but a pictural guide would be nice. (note: be sure to use the little rubber washer that you may not notice in the package so the thumbscrew will hold tight easily)The camera housing is fairly well designed, the stand is terrible though. just a simple piece of stamped metal, does have a nice finish though.  There is no place to strain relief the power cord.There is a fairly loud audible click when the camera switches to night mode, apparently switching in a IR filter. While the click can be annoying, it does seem to greatly improve the night vision compared to cameras that don't have this feature.The focal length is a little short and there is a manual focus dial on the front. Unfortunately it is very low profile so you have to kind of push on the lens end to turn it. This causes two problems, your fingers get in the way of seeing if it is in focus and when you let go the focus changes a bit so it is tricky to get it just right.The details to access the camera are conveniently located on the back of the camera so you never loose it, as well as an additional sticker you can use without staring at the back of an installed camera.  I put it on the power supply.You can access the camera through the cloud but you can also access directly on your LAN - THANK YOU! seems other cloud cameras I have used force all video through their servers to lock ou into paying for service. Since TRENDnet offers cloud free they didn't have this concern and make it easy to just pop in the IP and go directly to the camera on your own network.Maybe I missed the obvious or it is buried somewhere on the CD (no I did not read the full manual). The default user:password was nowhere to be found. Google to the rescue, it is admin:admin.Another downer was the lack of browser support. Using my up to date favorite browser I was greeted with this message:The current browser version you are using (Google Chrome 26.0.1410.65) may not be supported by the TRENDnet Cloud service. Mobile device supported by the TRENDnet CloudView mobile app, not by browser. The following MAC (except IE) and Windows browsers are supported:Firefox: up to 20.0Google Chrome: up to 25.0Safari: up to 6.0Registration is not as easy as it should be. You click registration in the camera interface and then you go to the TRENDnet website where you again have to click to register and then fill in all the camera details including model number, serial, etc. This data could easily be passed from the camera link, but if not at least give me a screen on the camera I can copy and paste from!Bottom line, there are some non technical details that are too complicated, but the technical stuff is super easy. Anyone can set this camera up, but a big font pictorial of the set up process with steps 1,2,3 would be a great addition.
$SUMMARY.: Set up is easy, but needs a quick start guide.

$review_text.: It's tiny, but the grippy rubber means it stays put on the bottom of my 70-200mm lens collar.  In fact, this little might-might after being well tightened held my lens and camera steady even though it was slowly rotated vertically through 180 degrees.  Even the plates designed specifically for the camera didn't work that well. The D-Ring (tool-less) tightener is a great add.The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are the following two nits:1. The slot on the d-ring is too small to insert a quarter (or penny). Sometimes the extra torque you get from pocket change helps to tighten or loosen the plate.2. It's really small which makes it a bit more fidgety to get it on an arca style clamp, and it also means that you may need to mount it at right angles to what you'd normally do in order to get the most surface contact with the camera.
$review_summary.: Small and Mighty..


The grippy rubber saves the finish (and improves the grip)

The sound is excellent and they are very comfortable to wear and stay on snugly during exercise.  Funny - I liked them so much I actually bought another pair figuring that at some point my first pair would break from all of the use during exercise, but I'm happy to report I still have an unopened spare pair since my first pair still working perfectly (despite a few times tugging what I thought would be a bit too hard on the wires.).I definitely would recommend these to you fitness folks out there who like to listen to music during your workouts, but would also recommend them to anybody that prefers an "earhook" type of headphone.  I've been very pleased with this product.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this as a back up for one of my Foscam outdoor cameras.  Yesterday one of the power supply cords broke off.  Fortunately I had this back up.  I plugged it in and checked to see that it was working.  The green light on the outside of the unit glowed brightly!  Then within 20 minutes, I noticed the camera was not working.  I went out and checked to see what was wrong.  The green light was off.  I unplugged it and tried replugging it in.  It was then that I heard a rattle inside.  The fuse inside must have popped.  What a waste of money.

$review_text.: This is my 2nd Zune 120 and this is one guy who couldn't be happier
I had a problem downloading the software but was able to get live help and we had it up and working in less than 30 minutes


I find the software and the Zune easy to use and I'm 58 years old!!!! So what's the big deal with a couple fingerprints on the case

Buy some Windex!!!! I got several docks (one for my PC, one for my Stereo and one for the radio at work) and 2 car kits

Canceled my XM radio, put away my cds and I'm enjoying listening to the music I want to hear!!!!!April 26, 2013 Update
I'm now 62 and it's been over 4 years since I purchased this, my 2nd Zune 120 GB player and both are still working perfectly
I have over 1000 albums stored on them, thousands of photos and their just over half full
They are used every week for hours
Could not be Happier
I'm more concerned about longevity than having all the latest bells and whistles and have no need to buy a new device every few months, but then I OLD (you can probably tell because I said Albums) and not easily impressed by the latest Gimmicks..

All I need is for it to play My Music....

$review_text.: The wide zoom--16-35, 17-35, 17-40, 20-35, et al.--has been a mainstay of pros, especially photo journalists, since the early 1990s. These focal lengths are ideal for sweeping views and shooting in tight quarters, and are easily hand holdable. The 17-40L is my go-to wide zoom for landscape shooting on my 5D MKII and 6D. Important note: if you use a 1.6X cropped frame camera, e.g., Rebel, 60D, 70D, etc., this zoom will have the field of view of a normal zoom, i.e., 28-65mm equivalent.CONSTRUCTION: Canon's EF 17-40 4L USM brings together precision optical design, blazing AF, durable construction and silky smooth zooming. At $750, it's more affordable than the EF 16-35 2.8L USM II, but offers similar build and optical quality. The hybrid metal and polycarbonate construction and quality components make the EF 17-40 4L USM tough as nails, but a lightweight 475 g (16.8 oz). Plus, the moisture and dust seals, including a rubber O-ring on the lens mount, make it a great choice for jungle and beach shooters. Canon recommends use of a clear or UV filter to complete weather sealing (front element moves slightly when zooming).The EF 17-40 4L USM is a classic two-touch design: manual focus ring near the end of the barrel and zoom ring near the mount. Handling is nimble and decisive. Both zoom and focus mechanisms are internal so there is no nested barrels. Plus, internal mechanisms are less prone to sucking in dust than front extension designs. Unlike most AF lenses, the manual focus ring is large, ribbed, rubberized and nearly as smooth turning as the manual lenses of yesteryear. The satin black finish is elegant and the overall appearance similar to the EF 16-35 2.8 USM II and EF 24-105 4L IS USM.The filter size is 77 mm, making filters expensive. This size is common for L series optics, so you can share filters with the EF 70-200 2.8L IS USM and EF 24-105 4L IS USM. The clearance from the edge of the front element to the filter threads is huge and, subsequently, normal thickness filters such as a Hoya Super HMC UV do not vignette on full frame cameras like the 5D MKII or 6D.AUTO FOCUS: This lens sports a ring-type USM (Ultrasonic Motor) that drives an internal lens group and AF really rips. The front element does not rotate nor does the barrel expand or contract during focus and zoom operations. The motor of the EF 17-40 4L USM is silent during AF. It has Full Time Manual (FTM), allowing you to manually focus without switching out of AF mode. If you prefocus manually, the distance window in meters and feet is handy. AF worked flawlessly on my 5D MKII, 6D, 5D,  A2, 3 and Elan 7E. That is, AF is fast, accurate and decisive.IMAGE QUALITY: The constant F4 aperture is a big plus for hand meter users and those that prefer manual or aperture priority exposure modes.I found EF 17-40 4L USM sharp and contrasty. There is slight improvement when stopped down to F5.6 or F8, but it is almost as good wide open. The contrast and snap of this lens is apparent even through the viewfinder. After all, there's exotic glass in there, e.g., 1 UD and 2 aspherical elements. The short end, like most wide zooms, shows some barrel distortion. The long end has a small amount of pincushion distortion. For most use, distortion isn't a problem save for architectural photography.Flare is well controlled for a zoom. However, some flare and ghosting may occur with bright sunsets. Use the included lens shade (EW-83E) to protect the lens and help keep flare in check. Incidentally, the included EW-83E is a weak design: too shallow and dish-like, yielding a minimal amount of protection. The EW-83H, a deeper and narrower hood intended for the EF 24-105 4L IS USM, gives better protection and does not vignette at any zoom setting on both full frame and cropped cameras.FINAL BLURB: I bought the 17-40 4L in 2003. Ten years of punishment at beaches, waterfalls, jungles and deserts and it's still going strong, having outlived at least a half dozen of my cameras! If you need the versatility of a wide zoom, this is among the best. The EF 17-40 4L USM has similar build and optical quality as the famous EF 16-35 2.8L USM II, but at nearly half the price, weight but shy a F-stop. For discriminating hikers, travelers, landscape shooters and serious amateurs this zoom deliverers quality without breaking their shoulder or bank and can take the knocks they dish out.
$review_summary.: Sturdy, weather resistant, wide &amp; sharp!

This is especially inconvenient if you are showing powerpoint or videos from a USB drive (instead of an attached computer) because turning off the projector (to make it dark when you aren't using it) resets the presentation and you have to walk through the file tree again to restart it from the USB drive. Instead, I keep the projector running and block the light with a book or other object. Not ideal.PROS:o Brighter than I was expectingo Quiet (compared to the Epsons I've had)o Smallo Lighto Cool lookingo I have the peace of mind of knowing the bulb won't blow out on this presentation and leave me stuck.o I won't have to look all over the universe for a replacement bulb in a year or two, then decide whether it is worth it to replace the bulb or the whole projector.

 As long as you can live with the short legs that don't extend, this is a very good tripod
 However, with the flexible legs that wrap around a pipe or other object, you can put it at any height you want
 I mainly use it to take photos for eBay sales and often put it on top of couple of phone books to raise it to the proper height for my photo tent.All in all, this tripod is worth the price.

The chip is faster but not of the same quality as the hx9v.  I haven't yet extensively shot lower resolutions but in general as others will vouch for, using a point and shoot at anything over 12mp and you're just pushing your luck anyway.  My quick impression on the few I did shoot at lower resolutions, the pics were stellar and closer to the hx9v, but not it's equal.  a minor issue but I liked the build of the body on the hx9v better as well.That said, everything else about the camera was superior, the general operation was quicker, shots were quicker, video recording was quicker.  the sony menu system needs work but just in general, the experience has been that of an upgrade I am happy I made.  I am in the minority here but I found the wifi option a very nice addition.  The complaints about having to switch your ipad to the camera's wifi network were pointless to me.  When you look at it, there just isn't a way around that issue, this is exactly how the eyefi cards work as well, it's probably an available api issue.  Sony in my eyes has made the experience as painless as it possibly can.  Would it be more advantageous not to have to switch wifi networks?  obviously yes but givent hat's not feasible, it works great.  I found it ridiculously convenient to be able to send a few shots to the ipad or iphone when on the go to quickly post to facebook, texting or something like that.  I also without any problems, loved the feature to wifi send and offload images to my home desktop when at home.  I could have just been lucky or maybe I am network savy enuf, but for me, everything worked as advertised on the wifi front.  a 20</review_text><review_summary>Drive died in 1 month :(</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1MYNMMX2O1DXF"><latest_review_date>07/08/2007</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0062FZ2WS</product_id><review_date>07/08/2007</review_date><review_helpful>[14, 14]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Terrific and easy</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1N0DWFSHCTEFJ"><latest_review_date>27/02/2010</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B000EMCZ52</product_id><review_date>27/02/2010</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>not a quality lens; photos will come out shady; or fuzzy; but it is good if you want diversify, add a little effects to your photos. experimental cheap lens!

$review_text.: I recently purchased a Roku (2XS) at a local big box store for our bedroom, as we had a Wii connected to our living room TV
 After seeing how easy it was to use, I decided to move it to the living room, which left us with nothing in our bedroom, so I decided to purchase this one to use there.Hookup is very easy &amp; quick


 Navigation is much easier on a Roku than a Wii!!!  The Roku's are great for Netflix, Crackle, etc..
However, I've found that a lot of the other channels do not stream as well

 There is sometimes a lot of buffering on these channels, where as Netflix (&amp; other movie channels) stream flawlessly, so I can only assume it is the way the channels stream &amp; not the internet connection, nor the Roku.Some of the other channels are nice, but some are just useless (hence the 4 star rating)!!!  If you are wanting something to stream Netflix, Crackle, Pandora or some of the other bigger named services, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  However, don't get caught up in the dream that this will replace existing cable/satellite services..

It won't.The only thing I wish the company would change is the fact that the Roku's don't power off
 Other than that, it's a great product!

$review_text.: PROS:- The trim looks OK. (That's all that matters, right?)CONS:- Very poorly written, hard to see/read manual.- Screws are too long and scratch the bottom of the stereo unit (albeit at non-visible area)Tried to use it for Honda Odyssey 2002, replacing factory radio with Pioneer FH-X700BT.The manual is poorly written. Fonts are tiny and diagrams are tiny. I ended up cutting wrong tabs, making it impossible to use the side (ISO?) panels to screw the unit to the car frame. When I realized this, I ordered the same one from Amazon, grudgingly. Fortunately, 5 minute later, I tried re-using the side bracket from the old factory radio and it did fit, although with some difficulty. I immediately cancel the order.All in all, I ended up using only the front trim. Also I used the rear-bottom bracket that held the front trim in place (I may not even need that one). But the tiny screws that join the two was too long and scratched the audio unit, albeit at an invisible area.It looked good once all the work was done.What's the lesson? Look very carefully the shape of the original factory radio's bracket and cut out only those tabs that are needed. Don't rely on the manual since you likely will be more confused. "Use the force".Hence, -1.5 star from the screws. -2.5 stars from the confusing, hard to read manual.

$review_text.: My dissatisfaction with the Canon SD880IS all stem from really missing my old Fujifilm F30.  That good old camera has the best lens/CCD of any point-n-shoot that I've ever seen.  Even ISO1600 photos were usable.  Everything was low noise.  But (probably because it's Made in Ch---) the two F30's that I've owned all crashed way before reaching 2 full years of use.  Yes, I had liked the camera so much that after the first one died I bought another one to replace it.Yes, the problem with the SD880 is NOISE NOISE NOISE.  Even at very low ISO I can see the noise everywhere on the picture.  I tried going for lower pixel count but they are still very visible.  If you want to buy this camera, make sure that you've taken a few photos and zoom them out in playback mode.  It's only after feeding a photo through Noise Ninja that I finally breathed a sigh of relief.Noise problem aside, the SD880 is packed with so many neat features.  I've set the manual white balance to be trigged by the printer button. All I have to do is to point the camera at the white ceiling, press the printer button, and the camera is white-balanced exactly for that specific lighting.Face detection works great, and I really like the TV - self-timer - Face detection combo:  I hook the camera to the TV, put the self-timer on Face detection mode, press the shutter, and nonchalantly walk to the spot of my choice before turning to face the camera.  The camera reads my face and multiple shots of me are made.This camera takes BEAUTIFUL indoor photos -- with a flash, that is.  (The Fuji F30 had been able to take all sorts of great indoor photos without flash.)  The Canon engineers have done a great job with post-processing to get such nice even lighting on indoor photos, especially with such a tiny flash.I take photos with i-Contrast off.  In the playback mode, I can apply the i-Contrast as I choose.  And speaking of i-Contrast, I find that the SD880 tries too hard to second guess what photos I want, and the photos tend to turn out a bit flat.  The photos all improve tremendously when I use Picasa or Photoshop to deepen the shadows.  This is especially true with indoor photos.The video mode is not so useful.  There is no optical zoom with video.  The camera fakes a video zoom by doing a digital zoom.  Of course, if the video is already only 640x480, doing a digital zoom will get you horrendous resolution.  So just pretend that there is no video zoom.  The microphone on the camera is bad.The handling of the camera is very good, and it is a beautiful looking gem.  And I hope that its being "Made in Japan" will at least buy me more years than my two terrific but unfaithful Fuji F30's.  Now if Canon were to come up with a 28mm F2.8 camera that had the same CCD-sensor philosophy and the manual controls as the F30 (fewer Megapixels for superb noise control), I would really PAY for that camera, bad economy or no.[Correction to my original review]I gave up on this camera.  I had written that indoor photography with flash was very nice.  I WAS WRONG.  The flash is simply too weak.  If the subject is perfectly still, yes, indoor shots with flash is lovely.  But last week I photographed some kids at a Thanksgiving dinner party.  They weren't even moving that much, but the flash could not freeze their motion.  In a normally lit room, with the camera set at hi-ISO (ISO 250) the shutter speed was 1/10 sec with flash.  Subject blur occurred.  I have never encountered such problem with any of the myriads of point-n-shoot that I've owned in the last 25 years.The camera is truly beautiful to behold.  But at the end of the day, it's decent photos that I want.  The lens is too small, pixel density on the CCD is too high, and the flash too weak.  No fancy bells and whistles on the electronics can overcome these physical limitations.

It wouldn't work at all in Normal mode. But it wasn't able to remove the backdoor files that the trojans and virsus had left, preventing me from having full use of my computer. I contacted the Tech Support and was able to get his assistance via remote connect. But I didn't like the fact that he never actually called me and told me what he was doing. He instaled a program on my compuer, that was suppost to give me back control over my control panel (trojans took that over) - but it didn't work. The time that I wasted using this program, communicating with tech support, and waiting on everything via remote connect - I could have already reinstalled my entire operating system. Which I had to reinstall the operating system on all 3 of my computers anyways. If you have a major infection, don't waste your money on any software or service to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it. Just get all important files off your computer by loading them to USB flash drive and reinstall your entire operating system. That way you will know for certain that the infections are truly gone and any backdoor files have been completely erased. By reloading your entire operating system, it will delete any and all files that are currently on your computer - basically restoring your computer to an out of the box state. That is the best and safest way to remove any infection. The one set back to that would be reinstalling any OS updates, which can be time consuming - but the cheapest way. I personally can not recommend this product because it didn't fix any of the issues that remained on my computer.

Having both amazing read and write.... however this line the write speeds don't compare with manyof the competitions drives. Although the price point is lower and to be honest you will use your read way more than your write in most occasions.The bottom line.A fast stable drive that you will see the increase in speed from a HDD. Not quite as fast as its brother and only minimally priced differently. Look at your budget and choose the best one for you!

The interior is an awful change from the images on Amazon and I am really disappointed.Here's a quote from the description of this product: 'The molded EVA-foam case features fitted rubber bumpers, keeping your iPad in place while you navigate its Multi-Touch display.'  I received my iPad yesterday. put it in the case, snugged the bumpers against the four corners of the iPad, picked up the case and my iPad fell out.

$review_text.: This slim drive is slimmer than I imagined! It's half the thickness of other portable drives
It's got a simple, utilitarian design that I'm not terribly fond of


I like splashes of color
Construction-wise, it feels a bit delicate
The housing is plastic and the matte black finish picks up fingerprints and smudges like there's no tomorrow

Right out of the box, my first touch left fingerprints.It comes formatted for NTFS, so if you're a Mac user, you have 3 options: 1) wipe this drive with Drive Utility and reformat for Mac, 2) install the included Paragon NTFS drivers so your Mac and write to the drive, or 3) reformat as FAT-32
Macs can already read NTFS drives but can't write to them without additional software
For users in a dual environment, this is a great idea, but you must install it on all your Macs

In a corporate environment like mine where I am locked out from installing anything, this is not an option for me

Most users can probably go with option 3

Unless you need to store individual files that are over 4GB large (like movies), this should suffice for you (music, photos, work documents, etc)


FAT-32 is mutually readable and writable by Windows computers and Macs.Speed is good.
nothing to complain about


At its fastest, I got 90 MB/s copying some movies

Drive runs very quietly and I can't tell it's even on

I find that USB 3 cables are too short however.


I have another drive from Western Digital and the cable was just as short
18" is sometimes just not long enough if you're connecting to a desktop and the ports are inconveniently placed
But the short cable is perfect for laptop users
For older systems, USB 3 falls back to USB 2 speeds.Overall, a nice slim drive


Make sure you get a carrying case for it though

I've killed half a dozen drives carelessly throwing them into my bag or pockets


Price-wise, this drive is just OK


For just a little more, you can get a Western Digital portable with double the capacity and different colors
Assembled in China, 3 year warranty.Will update review when I am able to test Paragon on my own Mac.

$REVIEW.: I ordered mine with the base that mounts to the threads on the camera, and the neoprene wrap with velcro, but to be honest, I like the way it mounts to the adhesive one better. The eyepiece, for some reason, stays in place better with that one, and its better for keeping out ambient light. It has adequate magnification. Not too much, but plenty to make racking focus a snap. For the money you're spending, this is good gear.

$REVIEW.: For the few bucks I spent on this I am surprised at how well it worked, especially for night driving.  I wasn't looking for a crisp high quality HD camera, just one that would be good enough to show fault in a vehicle accident.  The sound recording wasn't bad either.  The interface could be better but only in that an extra button or two would be nice.  The menu is ok.  I love the cyclical recording.  All I am concerned about with this camera is capturing the last negative moment - the accident or incident.  With a large card, 8GB or more, this is doable.  Not a bad purchase but to have but it does leave a little to be desired in quality and I'll recommend it only for customers to see if a mobile/dash cam is right for them and if so stick with it or consider upgrading but either way, you haven't spent a whole lot of money such as with a </review_text><review_summary>this bad boy is good!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1NBBG8BALZ0BP"><latest_review_date>13/06/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B005ES0YYA</product_id><review_date>13/06/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>i just bought a brand spanking new macbook air 13" with i7 and i want to protect my investment. this laptop aint cheap.now theres tons of made in china knock  off keyboard clear guard but this moshi is by far the best. my wife owns one andshe loves her too. stay away from those knock offs and go with moshi. highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: What a difference a year makes.A little more than a year ago, Xtrememac came out with a wireless speaker system/ iPhone charger that enabled all Bluetooth devices to connect to it in a handsome bookshelf-style design.I was impressed more with the aesthetics than with the components.  The speaker system which was a compact version containing 6 speaker including tweeters and a woofer, left a lot to be desired audibly.The new "Tango Bar" is here and it appears that Xtrememac had been listening to its customers.  The Tango Bar is a dream piece of audio equipment for the mid-price range audio shopper.****  ******The most obvious thing about Xtrememac, one of the more prolific Apple-oriented accessory companies, is that their products are handsome, well-built, exterior designs.  Visually, a classy addition to any computer set-up.Xtrememac products are also, however, on the pricier side, and far exceeding their value when compared with like products that boast of more powerful components.But, they did something interesting this time around.  They kept the beautiful silver grey metal grill bar but they focused on the internals.  They've created an integrated system that can function as a peripheral to a computer (through a USB extension) as well as a universal peripheral to other audio equipment with a 3.5mm cable.Which means, you can replace a laptops speaker with this 6-speaker system that is considerably more robust than my MacBook Pro's internal speakers, for instance.  So, if you're taking your laptop in your travels, you have a fairly decent pair of speakers that will enhance most presentations. And, it's only 7"longer in length.****  ****I have a modest portable set-up in my home-art studio.  Consisting of a laptop with a pair of external JBL speakers, I've always been fairly happy with the audio results.  But, I had no idea what I was missing until I set this up for testing.I once had a pair of external speakers that relied on the computer's power source to function instead of an a/c current.  This resulted in a sound that was no different than the sound blasting from my laptop's internal speakers.  So, a friend gave me the wall powered JBL computer speakers that I've been using faithfully for the past 5 years.  When I saw the power input of the Tango Bar, I initially thought "here we go again."  Boy, was I surprised.You can also create, which is my preference, an extended (or a broader stereo sound) if you have a pair of a/c-powered speakers.  The setup is fairly simple:1) Tango Bar (USB) into the laptop/ desktop/ tablet USB slot.2) The external speakers 3.5mm jack is removed from the computer and placed into the Line-In input jack.3) System Preferences-Sound-Output4) "USB Sound Device" and adjust volume.This simple set gave me the effects of 10 speakers.  And, the sound is terrific.*** Conclusion ***The Xtrememac Tango Bar is a well-built and versatile speaker system that allows you to replace your computer's modest speakers with a much more robust audio speaker system.  It's also versatile enough to function as an extra pair of stereo speakers creating a fuller sound for movie and concert watching and it also has a sub-woofer input for bass-heavy fidelity.I really like what Xtrememac has done here and lastly, they've dropped the price from the </review_text><review_summary>So far, so good</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1ND4DRJO2BDZD"><latest_review_date>05/10/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00DMWV3EU</product_id><review_date>05/10/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Signal Boost</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1NDT85J5B0FXJ"><latest_review_date>20/05/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B009A6CZ26</product_id><review_date>20/05/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Not really worth the money.</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1NELD200ZAW2S"><latest_review_date>09/05/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0039YXNVC</product_id><review_date>09/05/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Amazing sound from such a thin unit!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1NF8AYDS3K72R"><latest_review_date>04/03/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0009RML8S</product_id><review_date>04/03/2014</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Pretty good for an "economy" DVD player</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1NGY4FLRCKGTR"><latest_review_date>18/06/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B007X9QIXO</product_id><review_date>18/06/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 2]</review_helpful><review_text>great product, it arrived here on time, great quality, i bought a small water proof camera so i needed a couple of extra batteries.. .i am glad i did

I expected better from Canon since I am a long-time Canon user and have many lenses by them

Images are soft to semi-sharp at all focal lengths

300mm is never sharp


When enlarged even 25% all images go very soft and become noisy and would be useless for printing

I get much better results with all my other Canon lenses


For the price of this lens I expected much better

My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images
Looking at the reviews others have written on Amazon, it may be that this particular lens has an inherent optics flaw


The IS works fine in both settings, but the images are still not crisp.

After doing quite a bit of research it always boiled down to the same thing unless one goes with an expensive Raid zero external array with SSD drives and even then it does not take full advantage of the interfaces capabilities ability to lay down the data.In other words the hard drive and it's controllers for once are the weak link and bottle neck. Lol how the times have changed.I like many others are in the same boat in that we own MacBook Pro 2011 systems that have firewire 800 and USB 2.0 in addition to the Thunderbolt interface.Sadly USB 3.0 did not make it to these systems.Oh but is it sad?My research showed me that I would be lucky to get firewire 800 to lay down 70 MB/per second that is 70 Mega Bytes per second not Megabits.I read complaints about this drive not giving true Thunderbolt speeds and thought sure 120MB per second is not true Thunderbolt speed but it is still better than Firewire may ever hope to put out.So instead of investing in an outdated Interface I purchased this more expensive drive with the Thunderbolt interface.In a word it is awesome as in wickedly quick for what it is. I have achieved speeds of over 270 Megabytes per second and compared to the 27 MB per second I was getting out of USB 2.0 this is wonderful.If you look at the customer attached picture I have provided you can see a live shot of a back up being Performed with the Super Duper Software by the developer Shirt Pocket it allows you to create a bootable Back up for OSX via external drives and this drive is able to be booted from.In this picture you can see it was at 269 MB per second but was actually fluctuating even higher.One thing I would like to say is the Thunderbolt interface on this drive seems to take a while to get up to speed or at least report the speed and the more data that is being written to it the faster it goes.The connections are very firm and the cable does not get hot as some have described even when transferring hundreds of Gigabytes of Data.The Drive slides onto the interface sled and the two combined are thick the interface sled is vented and both can get warm ( Small wonder at these speeds )The interface sled has a magnetic base under where the bottom of the drive sits. ( magnetic how strange. )The interface sled uses a standard SATA connection meaning you can slide the drive off of it and insert a regular notebook or notebook SSD drive and connect to it and run it I have not connected one of my SSD's to it yet but will and will take pictures and report the speeds achieved.You will need to put something under it to keep it even but a couple of adhesive Silicone Cabinet beads used to keep doors from banging should do the trick.Alternatively if you have another Seagate external drive a less expensive model that ships with the USB 3.0 interface you can disconnect it from its 3.0 interface and connect it to this Thunderbolt sled. I have this and have tried it, it works just fine and allows me to have two drives for redundancy and one always securely stored while the other is attached and ready for use.FYI be sure to remove all of the plastic from the drive portion there is a protective plastic film that covers the drive all over it has to come off to allow the drive to cool correctly. Yes it is even underneath so pull the drive free from the sled to remove it.Over all I could not be happier with this drive it is incredibly swift, back ups that used to take hours now only take minutes including the virtual machine images of Windows and Linux Mint that are on the MAC I run under VM Ware Fusion. Each of these image packages is well over 20 GB on their own.Way to go Seagate Awesome Drive.

For this M9P headphone, I've tried all the supplied ear tips but none of them were able to keep the headphone in my ear.  When I push it in my ear, it'll just eject itself out.  I'll have use my breath to moisten the ear tip and put it in so it stick better to the ear canal. But if I move my head, talk or eat, it'll come loose.In term of the sound quality, I found it inferior to the apple kit headphone.  The base is strong, but the mid is muddy and the high isn't clear enough.The headset functionality was the reason I chose this pair of headphone from MEE, but because of the isolation feature, when you talk, your own voice gets very loud and it is just weird.  But maybe it's how it is for isolation headphone..

$review_text.: This remote will change the setup of your home entertainment experience into something enjoyable


First, let me tell you what I used to have to do to get a DVD on


First, I would turn on the TV and select input 7, then turn on the DVD player, then turn on my AIWA receiver that the speakers are hooked up to
Then I would turn the AIWA dial to Video 2 (since I long ago lost the remote), then finally start the movie
Now, I just need to select "watch a DVD" and all of the above is done instantly

It's really quite amazing!  The remote can be programmed for the same devices in multiple rooms as well to control TV's, DVD players, game systems, stereos, mini systems, boom boxes, cable boxes, home climate, and more.After you install the remote software on your computer, you have to gather all of your model #'s, then attach the remote to your computer via USB


After entering your model #'s the software guides you by asking questions regarding your setup


After all questions are answered the remote is updated to work on your system

Should there arise a problem, the remote has an onscreen guide that will ask you questions in order to fix the problem


My initial problem was that the remote was turning on AUX 2, not video 2, so it actually fixed itself after using the onscreen help guide.This remote has a rechargeable lithium ion battery, and has over 250,000 different devices available at the web site for programming


In the rare event that your device is not listed, this remote can also "learn" functions if you have the old remote.One feature I'm disappointed in is that the remote is not pageable
It would have been a nice feature to add that, especially in a house with little kids that like to hide cool remotes.The customer service department was helpful with the one setup issue I had

Of course, it was user error, but I didn't know how to set it up for 2 CD players in 2 rooms, so they walked me through the problem and I had the issue resolved in under 5 minutes.I highly recommend this remote for audiophiles and videophiles


I cannot imagine going back to 10 remotes.

$review_text.: We've had this new Onkyo receiver for a week now, connected to our 5.1 Bose Acoustimass 10 system and it works wonderfully.  The HDMI upconversion has made life so much simpler for us and allows us to use a single HDMI connection between the receiver and our HDTV for all our system components.  The lack of audio up/down-conversion has not been an issue for us (but I suppose could be if we were trying to 'tape' a digital audio source on an analog recorder).  We're looking forward to getting the new Onkyo DS-A2X ipod dock whose release has been delayed probably until at least August 2007 (was originally supposed to be released in early July) as the new dock promises full ipod video and photo display passthru.  The value for the buck of this receiver is fantastic.  My only small gripe is that, for such a full-featured receiver, they don't have a way to jump to a preset radio tuner station.  It seems like a silly oversight, given that they allow up to 40 stations to be preset, yet the only way to get to the presets is to scroll through consecutively from one preset station to the next, rather than ie. have a Preset-station selection button and punching in the number of the station preset.  The only way to go 'directly' to a preset station is to manually punch in the station's frequency, but that defeats the whole purpose of having a preset.  I may be able to get around this issue next month when Logitech releases the updated firmware for their Harmony remotes which will allow for macro/sequential-command programming to a single remote button, allowing me to transmit each radio station's frequency with the press of a single button on the remote.

$REVIEW.: I wsn't sure if this case would fit my Nikon D7000 with 50-300mm lens attached, but it does fit
Actually it is a perfect fit.Very happy with everything about this case

The suspension system is cool and does just what it says it will do


It is only a little bit annoying to pull you camera out of it if you have a lens hood on.A shorter lens doesn't fit quite as well, but with the suspension system it doesn't really matter because the camera still sits right at the top of the bag, not boucing around inside


It really is a good design.

$review_text.: FYI: the power cables are CCA- AKA Copper clad aluminum which is about 3-4% copper and 96-97% aluminum
why is this important? CCA wires have the capacity of 65% of pure O2 free wires
that being said these wires arent terrible, and will work with many systems (def would not use it anywhere near 1600 watts)
fuse is 60 amps so about 720watts max for this kit at 12v i believe

The problem is that DB does not have this info on their packaging


this is the reason why I will give this product 2 stars

for all the 5 star reviews, I respect their opinions but I feel their rating will be misleading to new or inexperienced consumers


im using a mix of DB and rockford/sEFX wiring components and I like the RF and EFX way better than DB
unless you are very desperate and have limited funds or just don't feel like paying more, this amp kit will probably work for you if you a low powered amp.Pros:* Cheap* visually appears true to AWG specs (compared to my Rockford  4g and 8 gcable)* complete kit for a single ampCons* build quality is barely adequate* CCA will create more resistance+ heat and has a lower conductivity compared to higher end kits with pure copper* Misleading packaging and product info* Kit appears to contain other components in many other of the low cost kits from china

check amazon.com for their picks, all the wires and RCA cables are most likely made by the same company and repackaged.

$review_text.: Wow.  This is a truly amazing little camera.  I bought this to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  I had my coolpix for just over 12 months when it broke, due to no fault of my own, and it was going to cost $150 to repair.  Rather than repair a camera that I liked but didn't love, I decided to make a new purchase.My initial intention was to purchase a Canon Rebel, I have used my mom's in the past and really love that camera.  I loved using the interchangeable lenses and the ability to manually focus.  Seeing the cost though ($500+,) plus the cost of additional lenses, it just wasn't in my price range at the moment and I needed a new camera urgently.  If you're looking for a DSLR, do not expect this to function the same.  It's a powerful little camera, but it is NOT a DSLR.  If you're an amateur photographer and have no intention of taking a class to learn how to use the functions of a DSLR, this is a perfect camera for you.So began my research.  It became a toss up between the Canon SX510 and the Nikon L820.  Reviewers were split between the two, some preferring the Nikon, some preferring the Canon.  They seemed to come out about even except in a few minor categories, and having been very pleased with the Canon Rebel, I decided to go with the Canon despite it costing about $30 more than the Nikon.Pro's-*30x Optical zoom - awesome, no more grainy pictures of kids on stage during performances*Built in wifi - go ahead and upload your pics to facebook, send them to your phone, or directly to your wireless printer.*Manual setting - can do your own iso settings, white balance, shutter speed etc.  The auto setting works fabulously in most cases, far better than any camera I've ever owned, but the option is there for those times it's just not adjusting quite how you want it.*CMOS sensor provides for a clearer image, especially on the macro setting, than my own eyes give me.*Zoom assist - for when you use your 30x zoom but lose your subject*Size - for anyone that has gone hiking with a DSLR and multiple lenses, you know what a pain that can be.  This lighter camera is perfect for running around and still has a lot of the qualities that you'd look for in a DSLR.  So unless you're out taking professional shots, this comes in really handy*Discreet mode - This is a setting on the dial, great for those events when there is no flash allowed.  In this mode, the camera doesn't make noise when turning it on, nor does the flash go off.  Even if the camera goes off and you turn it back on, because it is set on the dial, it doesn't reset itself.  I've accidentally had my flash turned back on so many times that way on previous cameras.Cons -*Very poor manual - A lot of skipping around to get one thing done.  IE Looking through the start up manual, it says "for instructions on attaching (the lens cap cord and neck strap) please see the user manual on the canon website"  Granted, it wasn't difficult to figure out, but there was no clear spot for the lens cap cord, and it is something that should have been included in a "start-up" manual.  Another example of a poor manual, referring to the downloadable pdf manual...say you want to learn how to use the miniature setting...so it says "miniature setting, pg 48"  You go to pg 48 and it says to follow steps 1 and 2 on page 46....okay back to page 46, got that down, back to page 48.  It seems to be this way when trying to learn how to access any of the features.  I can't fault the actual camera for this, but definitely Canon.  I actually made up my own cheat sheet for accessing my favorite features until I have it down.*No ability to manually focus - Being that this camera is not a DSLR, I didn't expect or really even hope for this feature.  I would have liked it, but for the $$, I definitely can't complain and will upgrade in the future.*Mirrorless - I would definitely prefer to use a viewfinder, I am used to going without though, so it's easy to work around.*No Raw Shooting - this feature doesn't apply to most people, but sometimes I prefer to use it*No Touch Screen - This is taking time for me to get used to, I find myself constantly tapping the screen.  My last 2 cameras, going back to 2010, have been touch screen, so I'm surprised to find this camera doesn't have one.Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of accessing the wifi, this was fairly easy for me and took about 15 minutes max.  It's a little more work than it typically takes to connect a device to wifi,and you have to use the computer to do it, but it's still not overly difficult.Despite the cons, I'm still incredibly impressed with this camera and it has definitely earned 5 stars when taking into account the type of camera, the construction, and the value.  I'm very happy with this purchase despite the fact that I was hoping for my next camera to be the Rebel.  I never imagined I'd get a camera of this level of quality for under $400.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this receiver in order to set up a home theatre. It is replacing my 30-year old Onkyo receiver which is still great! Unfortunately my 30-year old receiver has no home theatre capabilities, so it was time for an upgrade. ;-)I am using this receiver to switch my HDMI and Component inputs; my DVD player and cable box outputs connect to the receiver, with the receivers HDMI output connecting to the TV input. I have 5 speakers (2 front, center channel, and 2 surround) connected to the receiver, with my front speakers being 30-year models that I purchased with my previous Onkyo receiver.The only 'negatives' that I would have about the receiver is the complexity of the manual and the remote control. If you are a 'techie', its not too difficult to figure your way around to set things up and use it on a daily basis. Otherwise, I recommend you get a 'techie' to help you out.

$REVIEW.: This cover has low-key looks and can really pass for a hardback dead tree book, if anybody should want that. I like the built-in pocket and the fact that the cover isn't slippery; lots of protection is offered, too. I had to fiddle with the orientation of my Fire in the cover a little bit, but it was worth it. I LOVE it! Sometimes I wish it were a little snazzier, but that's all.

If you own a digital TV everything you need is in the box.This antenna is not going to pull signals out of thin air, but if you are getting any kind of reception of local channels it will make them come in clearly. The best way to determine if this will work for you in your specific area is to scan through your channels on your TV. If you are receiving any stations - however marginal - then this will probably work. I live within thirty miles of some stations that I could select, but the video and audio quality were so poor that there was no need to bother. This antenna brought them in crystal clear as though I were on cable (which I am not). More importantly, a scan right after I installed this revealed additional channels that I did not know about.One of the things that impressed me about this kit is the antenna itself. It's almost as though it's made from fabric and can be laid flat, attached to a window or on the included stand. Wiring is simple too. I would have loved it had the amplified that's included been powered by a USB port instead of the wall wart transformer. My TV has USB, which would have powered it a lot more easily than my having to use an extension cord to get power to the transformer, but that is a minor issue.If you can received HDTV over the air signals in your locale this will allow you to watch them as though you were receiving them over cable - most of the time. My area gets frequent thunderstorms and a lot of rain in the summer and those do interfere with the reception quality this provides. But on a clear day ... you can see forever. Definitely recommended as one way to get off cable.

Additionally, loosening the control rods just a little, required to release the tension, makes them very wobbly, adding to the jerky motion required to overcome the stiffness of the mechanism.

I got this camera to replace my Digital rebel - EOS 300D.Good pictures, Good shots at low light levels, Bright colors and nice Wifi feature to have. Lenses are well designed.I liked the Nikon 55-200MM VR lens that came with it. It clearly outweights the Tamron 55-300 mm lens as it has more clarity to the pictures taken and allows more light in!Will surely recommend it!

$review_text.: I got this for my sister for Christmas. She loves it because it is soft and protects her Kindle from scratches. This case will NOT protect it if you drop your Kindle. If you want something that can protect it from drops and scratches I would recommend going with an Otterbox.The color of the case is pretty true to the picture. I would say the color may be slightly darker. It's still gorgeous though.

The stock Samsung on screen keyboard is far from desirable. My hands are big and I still have to hunt and peck to type with this keyboard. You have to apply more pressure to the keys to get it to activate the character. I have mainly been using this as a carrying case. It is starting to show wear after daily use. The trim around some of the edges is starting to crack. The tab that flips over the edge of your tablet to hold it in has finally cracked from repetitive use and fell off.  If the edges get knicked from use, a sharpie marker will make it less obvious about the wear. The cure to my lack of efficiency was getting the SwiftKey 3 app which greatly improved my speed and accuracy. I wouldn't buy this again.

$review_text.: The Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse is an aesthetically pleasing mouse optimized for Windows 8, and is advertised as working with most tablets and laptops.  I was quickly able to pair the mouse with my Windows 7 laptop and download the software from the Microsoft Device Center, which allowed me to customize the settings and do things like assign mouse buttons to do different things in different programs. The whole setup process was quick and intuitive.I tried to mouse on several surfaces, including a wood table and a granite kitchen counter.  The mouse, which is powered by a AA battery, worked flawlessly on either surface. I did not try it on a carpet, but Microsoft says it will work on that surface as well.  The mouse only has two buttons, on the underside of the device, for power and to open the battery door.My only complaint is the size of the mouse. Microsoft advertises the fact that the Wedge Touch has a "compact design for ultimate portability." This mouse is a bit on the small side for my hands. When using it, I find that I "grip" the mouse using my thumb and ring finger, and that my index and middle finger do all of the clicking. Using the mouse for hours may be stressful on my fingers because the smaller size forces me to cup my hand more tightly around the device.Bottom line, I like the Wedge Touch Mouse. It looks different than a standard mouse and I appreciate the fact that Microsoft is trying to produce a compact mouse that travels easily, If you have large hands, however, you may find it uncomfortable or difficult to use.

$review_text.: I would have preferred a "flat black", the finish is a bit more glossy than I would like for this particular application (photography studio). Product works fine though and I even ended up mixing in some CAT-6 jacks from another manufacturer. They did not fit as tight as the Leviton jacks but they work fine as well.

Charge levels are accurate.  The battery will charge to 100% but it will take just a few more minutes for the green checkmark to appear.  That's not a problem.I was able to listen to 3 hours of internet radio using WiFi while mowing the yard and still had 47% battery life showing. That is a huge improvement over the standard battery.It is larger than the origal battery and comes with a replacement cover that fits well.  I ordered an otterbox case that accomodates the extended battery so it's well protected while outdoors.  I'm good with it.

$review_text.: I purchased a battery grip for my Nikon D5100, and read reviews that the cheapo $3 + $5 shipping EN-EL14 knockoffs work fine in the battery grip as long as you use them with an authentic EN-EL14.  However, I didn't want to be in a pickle if my EN-EL14 was out of juice, and I had heard of problems with charging the knockoffs in the standard charger.  I decided on the Wasabi battery kit because the reviews tell me I can trust them to work and they do!The charger has a red LED for charging and a green LED for charged, which is very straightforward.  The batteries charge in less than 2 hours and last longer than the Nikon EN-EL14 (1300 mAh vs 1030 mAh).  These are decoded batteries, so they will also work in the camera individually - you don't need a battery grip.  Wasabi Power's 3 year warranty on the kit tells me that they are prepared to stand by the quality of their batteries, and that means I can probably trust them to be in my camera or battery grip and not damage the camera.The DC adapter seems like it will be very handy.  It all seems well built and the batteries fit snugly into my D5100.  This kit is great for someone who doesn't need the Nikon-branded batteries but who doesn't want to take the risk of spending only </review_text><review_summary>Works Great!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1Q5P5ML3176C0"><latest_review_date>27/06/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00092DZ6U</product_id><review_date>27/06/2014</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>IS is the the word</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1Q6A2AY55L8LH"><latest_review_date>20/09/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00DBENLAI</product_id><review_date>20/09/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Works much better than the HDMI to Thunderbolt cables you can buy</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1Q6CIJ3WSJP6X"><latest_review_date>31/01/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B001FY4DGC</product_id><review_date>31/01/2014</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Great Router and even better support.</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1Q6DAXHHIP482"><latest_review_date>11/02/2010</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00CTUIT20</product_id><review_date>11/02/2010</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>The best Christmas gift I could have gotten for each son-in-law!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1Q6E7U5KGIOI"><latest_review_date>19/11/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B007N6TWF8</product_id><review_date>19/11/2012</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>good MoBo for the price</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A1Q6O7G75XDOXV"><latest_review_date>17/02/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0097CXFCC</product_id><review_date>17/02/2014</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>I bought the IOMEGA portable HD (outstanding product too) and it fits perfectly along with the cable as well.

I listen to the radio while doing dishes so I do use this several times a week.  The sound is clear, the solar charger keeps the unit powered for my minimal use.  I have tested it with charging my HTC Thunderbolt cell phone and it will charge it to half power easily.  The flashlight works well also.  Today I went to turn the radio on while I was doing dishes, first time in a few days as I have been busy with holiday duties.  The radio was dead.  The charger wouldn't work.  I was fairly pissed and pulled out the instructions to see what the warranty was.  Glancing through the user manual while looking for the warranty I came across troubleshooting section and found where for my specific issue they recommended taking out the battery and hitting a reset button with a paper clip.  Bingo!  My radio is back on the kitchen window, charging.  I decided to order a second unit right then and there.  Great radio and a great price.

$review_text.: New phone....a little more patience and results that are night and day.Now I get a decent sound from a new phone without all the Dr Dre Beats crap messing with the output. While the headphones sound a little hollow and tend to be a bit heavy on the bass (not the super low stuff, but just above), they deliver a fine sound for the cost.Look it is not like this is a set of Bose $1000 headphones, but they do the job well for the cost. Actually, really well.Why I had such a negative experience earlier, I can only guess. But the new phone relies far less on the sound enhancements that Beats Audio ***may*** have been pushing into the mix (I actually do not know this...just speculating). Now with this very stock Virgin Mobile Supreme (ZTE Supreme), the sound is like night and day from before. I listened to movies, music vids and other items and it was great.The 4/5 reflects the quality of the output. It is not perfect, but for the cost...what do you want?***************Sounds like a tin can, no bass and basically worthless. Maybe I am doing something wrong (there sure are quite a few positive reviews!), but my experience has been the total opposite. I tried these with a few sources and the result is always the same. I even checked my Logitech G930 headphones side by side with the same source. The 930 worked great and these still stunk.I will give them another try and maybe I will find the issue. If I do, I will amend this review.
$SUMMARY.: I am totally amending this review (was: Did not work for me at all.)

$REVIEW.: i got these stylus in order to use my cell phone more efficiently. i gave one to a friend who absolutely loves it. i have been able to up my productivity on my cell phone. this stylus is very soft &amp; pliable, so it has to be used with a light touch. it is not an ink pen, so it should not be treated as one. don't press hard and keep the tip protected. that is common sense.

One occasion my wife borrow the camera and eventually not knowing the cap is not there anymore. the side part of this cap should be made of something rubber and it should be able to stretch tight then and only then this would make this product worth buying...

You can pick up at Wal-Mart for a few bucks cheaper.  I ordered simply not to have to go to WAl-mart as I didn't need anything else that week.

$review_text.: What more can you say about this product other than it does what is advertised to do? I can say that I bought mine from BlueProton and got Free Shipping and these guys were lightning fast about shipping it to me.It arrived in perfect condition and plugged easily into my USB port and popped my SDHC card into the reader and was able to quickly transfer my Audio books and music to the card without any problems.There are a few people that have commented on the size of the reader being large and interfering with other USB cables. Here is what I have found on this, all readers are made wide to accept the size of the SD card, there is no way around this. If your USB ports are laid out horizontally then you will have to unplug one of the other USB cords to get it to fit. If your USB ports are stacked Vertically there is no problem with it interfering with other USB cables. It is just a matter of the layout of your computers USB ports, either vertical or horizontal. Plain and simple it works.

 He has trouble focusing sometimes and has difficulty taking notes


 He thinks this pen is the best thing since sliced bread

 He's able to jot down a few notes in the special book using the livescribe pen
Then he listens to what went on the in the class when he gets home from school while reviewing his notes


 He then fine tunes his notes enabling him to better grasp what was taught in class.How does it work?  You have to use the special pen and notebook in conjuction with each other
You push record on the bottom of the page using the pen and then start to write

 It records everything that's said in the room and what you write on the paper

 You can listen to the pen on it's own but when you download it to your computer, the page that you wrote is downloaded (exactly the way it looks on the paper) right into the computer and then you can listen through the computer

We highly recommend this pen and book.

$REVIEW.: Some reviewers commented about the build quality of this lens.I agree it is a little light and flimsy-feeling but it's held together well and I've been using it quite a lot.Now, on to what matters! The images from this lens are beautiful! at f/1.8 max. aperture it's wonderful for using natural light indoors - the resulting images have been warm and saturated. Sure Canon offers F/1.4 and 1.2 versions that are much sturdier etc.  but it's the price that makes this one a winner.  It doesn't cost a lot to "check out" this lens and I haven't been disappointed. There are times that I wish it were a zoom, but I've gotten used to just backing up or moving closer. And consider, a comprable zoom in this range would either be much slower, or faaarrr more expen$ive. And even then you'd be hard pressed to find a zoom that's as sharp.I recommend it to anyone in the novice to avid-amateur status range. Snooty pros and people with unlimited budgets please disregard my humble advice (until I become one of you - preferably the unlimited budget thing . . . ) at that time my reviews may be of value to even you.

$review_text.: The instructions were easy to follow and the set up was accomplished in just a few minutes as advertised. Even the firmware update was simple to complete. With this said, the instructions are lacking on how to use the remote that came with the receiver/transmitter or more importantly that you need the source remote to control the device. This may seem obvious, but a small remote did come in the package and even had an up and down buttons to suggest you could change the channels.I was hooking up a TV in my office area so I could watch football on Sundays as these days it seems I'm always working weekends and wanted a way to watch football off a direct TV receiver that neither my wife nor my kids would likely be using during the day. The solution was to connect the transmitter to the DVR unit we have in our bedroom which again took all of two minutes. My office is in the basement while our bedroom is on the first floor but on the opposite side of the house so the signal had to go through a floor and a few walls. The signal was still very strong with no flicker or other video feed disruptions.If it was possible, I would have given the product a score of 4.5 as I couldn't give the product five stars (although the reception is like watching my bedroom TV) but for the fact the instructions could be a bit clearer.

Yes, the price is right and you get a free screen cover which are both nice but the grooves that allow you to prop up the pad are too short


My iPad 3 slips off them all the time

It's very annoying! I have also tried theTargus Versavu for the New iPad (3rd Gen)and really like it a lot! It has deep grooves which never slip and a rotating design that lets you change the viewing positions between landscape and portrait which is a nice feature! The on/off mag feature does not work correctly on any cover that I have tried so far
It's always hit and miss


We alway turn the pad off with the switch just to be sure
I think the extra 15 bucks for the Targus is money well spent


But this case is an OK alternative especially if you still need a screen protector.

$review_text.: This seems to be a great value. 8GB with 266x speed for a fraction of the price of other cards with this rating. But be aware that this is the read speed. So I've put it to the test. Reading at roughly 40MB/s it holds up to the specs but writing is poor: about 18MB/s. Which means you get less than 133x CF specification. You can get the Kingston 133x for about the same price. The only advantage over this would be that you can download your photos to your PC faster. So it always proves true that you get what you pay for. I don't want to say that it's a bad value but you won't empty out the cache of your DSLR as fast as with a SanDisk Extreme 40MB/s for example.

$review_text.: I have slowly been upgrading a box system and the last piece left was my subwoofer.  I used this to replace a 45 watt Yamaha and the difference is night and day.  My surround is in a smaller room so I thought that I didn't need to upgrade because I didn't need more bass.  However, with this I found out that it wasn't the quantity of bass it was delivering but the quality.  This thing hits lows my old sub never knew existed.I don't think it is mentioned in the description, but mine came with a quality subwoofer cable too.

$REVIEW.: Had for a few weeks now and it is perfect, protects the screen when closed, all openings are avail, except for micro sd card.  Sometimes it takes a moment of adjusting when on a surface like the bed to prop it up, but on hard surfaces, no problem.  Actually has two different places that the back can slide into to give a different angle, the one that it is designed to go into, and the little pen holder elastic also works as a brace.  Price, design, and slimness factor  all  great!

You also have to uncheck a couple things in settings like "Unknown App Sources" check to Allow, or amazon store will not load. You have to check the run "plug-ins" to view some online Flash Player movie sites. Youtube works great. My 3-year old broke mine soon as I got it all setup and was using it a couple days. I had a corded USB optical mouse plugged into it to use the onscreen keyboard, and he finally ran right through it, and it pulled the body from the 5V power socket, right off the PCB inside. I wound up opening it up to see if I could fix it being an old PCB designer. Teeny, tinny traces ripped from the board. Can't half see anymore and would need magnifier and super-fine tip soldering set to even attempt a brain surgery type repair. The board and the components are an amazing display of how small and miniaturized things have gotten since my old PCB designer intro-surface mount days, and through-hole days! The package is very solid and well made, except the two micro-usb sockets. They should improve the design of those. They are the weakest links, and are soldered to a couple small pads on only one side of the board, and they can be popped right off the board pretty easily, so be gentle with the two smaller USB ports! If anything breaks from cord pulling, it will be the power socket like on mine, and then the other one if used. P.S. the micro-SD slot works fine but you have to get the card pushed back past the metal housing with a small pointy tool. The HDMI plug is attached like a tank turret. You'd have to break the board in half, or melt it off with a blow torch to ever get that thing loose! (The device as a whole would break your TV's port before breaking the HDMI plug from the module) It's soldered to both sides, and a thicker gauge tin than the rest of the connectors. The full sized USB port is also soldered onto both sides, and is well attached. I discovered the antenna configuration everybody talks about concerning the Wi-Fi reception. It's high quality insulated wire about 4" long folded back inside, and strongly attached, but the problem is that the body of the device is 98% metal so it still blocks the RF, and acts as a shield to the antenna, though I don't think it's grounded. The antenna is not electrically connected to the metal shell. One could drill a small hole in the plastic cap near the root of the antenna wire and thread it through to the outside to get maximum connectivity. The end has a small screw in the middle, and once it's out, you can take off the end, and then the whole thing slides out the other side. The PCB assembly is captured in a plastic cradle that slides out in the direction of the HDMI like a drawer. It's pretty easy to remove if you need to get that antenna wire outside. I would not put it through the metal case, but through a small hole in the plastic end to avoid any shorting to the metal case. Aside from the two micro-usb ports, it's very robust and would not be afraid to put that antenna outside if you need to, and have some technical skill. Oh, and PS - There is a vinyl protective covering on the outside metal case to protect it during production and assembly to not scratch the anodized coloring. Peel that stuff off so the aluminum can better cool the unit. The plastic film is an insulator and helps to keep the unit warmer.

$REVIEW.: This is almost the PERFECT battery charger (for everything except 9V batteries).  At $22, it may also be the least expensive *smart* charger out there.  It has faced a lot of use over the past 2 years, and I've never had any problems.Most other smart chargers refuse to charge my years-old NiMH batteries, and I had resorted to dumb chargers to do the job.  Now I've tossed them all out, and this BC1HU is the only charger I'll use.  Those old batteries have continued to work great, even in high-drain devices like electric toothbrushes, and this charger gave them a new lease on life.  Although these days I'm craving more and more low-self discharge batteries (like the inexpensive Tenergy Centura's) in all my devices, but not quite enough to toss out old (but still working) NiMH batteries.It works great on all of Tenergy's batteries as well.  It's not the very fastest charger out there, but it charges plenty fast, and the somewhat lower speed means your NiMH batteries don't get quite so hot (which could shorten their lives).  The red/green LED indicators are much better than more expensive LCD based models that look impressive only when you first see them, and get annoying after some time.  With this charger, I can tell from across the room when even just one battery is done charging.Cons:9V battery charging resorts to dumb timer-based charging, and several people didn't read the instructions, and accidentally destroyed 9V batteries.  If only Tenergy would fix this ONE simple issue, I'd buy a dozen of these chargers for family and friends.  It doesn't need to charge 9v batteries fast, just smart &amp; safely.The power supply doesn't fit inside the battery compartment.  If they'd move things around just a bit (without making the charger bigger), so the wall-wart and 12V car adapter would both fit nicely inside, it would be superb for traveling.A USB port (or two) would be a nice, convenient addition that wouldn't notably increase the price, as seen on other Tenergy chargers.  Twice as good if it worked while batteries are charging (most don't).  Several times better if it also supplied higher-power in order to quick charge phones and tablets.  Those features aren't worth increasing the price significantly, though, as USB adapters are under $10.If it doesn't compromise the strength/durability or size, a little bit of ventilation would be nice.  With 4xDs charging, I leave the lid up, just to be safe.  Then again, even with vents, I might still feel the need to leave it wide open...Some people might like an option to charge common Li-Ion batteries as well.  I've stayed far away from them, but 9V Li-Ion batteries are tempting.  And if it keeps getting more difficult to find good flashlights that run on standard (AA) batteries, I might eventually relent on 3.7V cylindrical cells as well.Charger comparison:I also had the Tenergy V-9688, but it rejects most of my older batteries as "bad" even though they still work very well.  It also gets batteries rather hot as it charges them more quickly.  The viewing angle on the LCD is horrible, and you can't tell from any distance whether it's done charging or not.  Its lid is flimsy and breakable.  And worst of all, it isn't any smarter when charging 9V batteries, either!  The poor labeling ("L" &amp; "D") and prominent placement of the light/discharge buttons is also a terrible interface misdesign, which confuses average people and will result in many accidental discharges when they just want to see the charging status.Both model chargers run on 12V DC, so any $3 car plug is all you need for travel use (available from seller, and others), which I consider a big selling point, particularly for jobs like charging flash-light batteries while camping, or running from solar panels.

$review_text.: So I bought this cooling pad hoping to solve my laptop overheating issue. I can safely say that it does cool down your laptop very well. Being a techy computer person I did install a CPU temp monitoring program on my computer and I saw that this pad consistently lowered the temperature of my computer by a significant amount (&gt;7 degrees). The fact that it tilts is also nice as it lowers the stress on your hands while typing.That being said... I am only giving this 3 out of 5 stars because the product is cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. One piece broke on Fan 1 on the first day and about 20 days later the second fan went off its ball bearings. The reason I am not giving it a lower review is because a quick 5 minute phone call to the company that makes this product (Cooler Master) allowed me to fill out an online form for new fans - no questions asked. So their support is great and they guarantee their product. I am lowering it to 3 instead of 5 stars due to the problem of having to do this part request. A product should be good right when you buy it and not require new, yet free, parts.All in all, assuming nothing breaks, you will be happy you bought this. It does what you expect it to do - cool your computer. And if something does break support is a quick call away.

I am pleased to say that none of the problems that other people mentioned were apparent with my case. The iPad fits snugly inside the case...and there is a little loop on the top right corner that insures the iPad does not fall out. The case is quite nicely talored with stitching around all the edges as a nice added touch. The snap fastens securely and there is NO snap (metal material) on the side of the flap that goes over the iPad so I have no idea what some of the other people were talking about. Sorry, but the case IS leather so, once again, the other people complaining this was not the case must have received a case from a different supplier. The cover and the stand both have very small magnets within the material that makes the cover flap stay closed on the iPad when the case is closed and keeps the stand from dangling off the back. All in all, a very well designed case for the iPad. My only complaint is that there is really no way to stand the iPad upright(vertically)....only horizontally as indicated in the product pictures. Would I recommend this folio case to others....absolutely!!!

I bought six of them, and while they were not cheap, I don't like to trust my personal data to inexpensive (cheap) drives. While the Drobo does provide redundancy, there is no reason to court danger buying the less expensive drives.

$review_text.: I have found nothing wrong with the item.For those of you complaining about the fan being to loud. IT'S NOT. The idiots who put this thing together placed the fan in such a way that the power cable is STUCK in the fan. It's an easy fix. Simply unscrew the fan and reposition the cable at an angle where it doesnt hit the fan. Done.I hoped this helped, because before I realized this, I was looking for a new odd ball sized 80x80x20 sized fan to replace it.

$REVIEW.: I took the non-kit route and bought a house and this lens separately. After weeks of searching the web and reading far too many reviews for the perfect all-purpose lens, I couldn't resist the range and price of this lens. An 18-270mm at this price and with such good reviews was hard to pass up. The photos have been phenomenal and the VC (vibration compensation) works better than expected. Aside from a stiff zoom range that has subsided with usage and the occasional lens creep that can be prevented with a lens lock, this lens has been the jewel I'd hoped for and has delivered.

$REVIEW.: When I opened the shipping box, I immediately thought "what in the world."  This speaker is TINY - a bit larger than the palm of my hand.  So I was prepared not to like it.  I can now honestly report that my initial misgivings were unfounded - this speaker rocks!The packaging of the speaker itself is almost "Apple like."  A simple box, a speaker and inside, a micro USB cable and an extremely simple setup guide.  The guide itself couldn't be easier - it's all pictures and involves all of 3 steps - turn on device, link with Bluetooth, and play music.  How nice - setup is a breeze!  The micro USB cable even makes sense if you think about it - much smaller than an AC adapter, ensuring that the speaker itself is really portable.  The speaker itself has 4 buttons +, -, bluetooth synch, and on/off.  Simple to use, and from opening the box to hearing it play music took only seconds.Because this is a Bluetooth device, there's no docking station.  True portability.Turning to the most important part - the sound, I was very surprised by the quality given its small size.  You can blast this speaker without distortion, and the sound can fill a decent-sized room easily.  I'll freely admit - this speaker is tiny, and as a result, it lacks base sound at higher volumes, but the sound is still quite good.  In fact, other than the base sound at high volumes, the sound is comparable to our Bose Soundlink speakers.  And of course, this speaker is much smaller in size.I haven't tested the speaker's battery life to see if it lasts the full claimed 10 hours.  However, I have played this speaker for 5-6 hours with no need to charge it.In all, I'd highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a high-quality, portable device.  The age of the boom box is officially over!

$REVIEW.: I'm not new to the realm of home theaters.  I've been around some pretty nice systems growing up and 2 of my friends to this day have invested in home theater systems that cost close to the $10,000 range.  I've always been envious of their systems and told myself, when I have the money to throw around, I'll buy one comparable to theirs.  Well... to this day I still don't have that money to spend.For decades I've been living with "built-in TV speakers" on all my TVs.  Even when I bought my 55" Samsung a few years ago, I watched TV &amp; movies on that thing using the poor man's sound.  My wife pleaded with me to get a home theater system and wanted me to buy one of those "home theaters in a box" or a soundbar.  I refused not because those systems are bad (some are actually quite good), but because I felt that if we just saved a little bit more, I could get a high end system like my friends'. She threatened me periodically, that she was going to surprise me one day. I didn't believe her because in my household, I'm typically the one who buys electronics (she knows this). That's when she did it... she surprised me last Christmas with aSamsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar.I was surprised on two fronts. The first, that she actually bought a decent one. The second, that it actually sounded pretty good with my Samsung TV.  I was satisfied until she wanted to upgraded our TV.  So long story short, we bought a newer TV but didn't use the Samsung soundbar with it.  We relocated the soundbar and Samsung TV to another room.  But over time, we found ourselves watching TV on the Samsung despite the Vizio being BETTER visually.  We realized it was because of the sound.  We were so used to the soundbar, we didn't like watching TV on the Vizio, despite the better picture.  That's when I told her I was going to buy a soundbar for the Vizio.So looking around, I stumbled across this Vizio soundbar system.  What caught my eye was the fact that it was a 5.1 system.  Very few soundbars out there (especially the top ones) utilize satellite rears.  Because of that, I pulled the trigger on this soundbar system.  All I can say is WOW x 10000000000000000.SETUP:Easy as cake. Unboxed 2 satellites, the soundbar, and the subwoofer.  Being conditioned by other electronics manufacturers, I assumed I had to buy all the cables necessary for connection.  Not the case and I applaud Vizio for this.  ALL cables are included!!!  I didn't want to mount the soundbar (rather place it on the TV stand with the Vizio).  Plugged up the optical (Toslink) cable to the TV and the soundbar.  Plugged the power up.  Then plugged the sub in the back, connected the two satellite speakers.  Pressed power on the remote...then BAM.  Instant aural pleasure.  According to the instructions, the sub is automatically sync'd at the factory and this was the case for me.  But if you find that your sub isn't working, then do the factory reset (per the manual's instructions).EQUIPMENT QUALITY:Not cheap whatsoever.  Everything is well-built.  Nothing is flimsy or seems like it will break.  The remote is very nice with the LCD display directly on it.  More importantly, the remote is SIMPLE!  Not too many buttons to confuse you.  Unlike my Samsung soundbar with the LCD display, you don't have annoying lit letters glowing in front of you while you watch the TV.SOUND QUALITY:Really amazing... I haven't experienced REAL surround sound in a while in my house (previous on my computer with a 4.1 system) and this definitely fits the bill and then some.  Bass is boomy enough to feel it yet isn't enough to blow your house down (like my friend's sub). The surround sound envelops you and the audio quality is great for such a system.  What's really awesome is that it supports DD5.1 and DTS Digital surround sound.  No downmixing problems!On a side note, it also supports bluetooth audio.  While I don't use this much (I don't listen to music on my phone), my wife adores her playlists on her iPhone.  We sync'd this sucker to her phone and it was an instant party.  Awesome for those who hosts parties, has get-togethers, or just want to listen to music with great sound.OPTIONS:There are lots of options to tweak the soundbar but it's not so complicated where you feel like you're reading some kind of physics equation.  All settings are programmed via remote and the LED indicators on the actual soundbar itself will light up telling you what setting you have currently set based on the category you select on the remote.  For example, say you want to adjust the subwoofer level.  You browse to it on the remote, then use the left or right buttons and the soundbar has these LEDs that light up showing you the current setting.  All this stuff is explained in the manual if you want more details.FINAL OPINION:No, this won't rival those multi-thousand dollar sound systems but if you're on a budget and considering increasing the quality of your audio, I seriously suggest looking into this specific model.  As of writing (12/3/2013), this (the 42") is the 2nd best one Vizio makes.  The better one is newer and it was actually JUST released (there was a commercial for it on TV).  That one is the 54" model.  Either way, I'm truly impressed with soundbar and would recommend it to anyone.  It's so impressive, my wife can't stop raving about how great it is.

this bag is very slim and probably can't even hold a mouse or the power cord comfortably


I would not recommend this unless you have a computer that doesn't need a power cord (which I think is no one)


The pockets are very tight and I would only imagine putting just paper in there.I am only keeping it because it is the only thing I have right now and other bags are so expensive

I realllly want to return this item..

I guess a few positives is that it seems like a sturdy bag
I like the shoulder strap
I will probably just use it as a laptop carrying case.

$review_text.: I got this adapter to replace my previous D-Link DWA-130 (which was also great). The reason for the upgrade is I also upgraded my router to the LinkSys E3200 and wanted to take advantage of the 5 ghz band of the router. I'm running Windows 7  and the setup was a snap. Although it wasn't plug n play (I had to install the drivers with the CD) it was simple enough and I have had 1 week solid uptime with 300 Mbps. Very pleased.

 The failure process was the same as others have seen:  The unit works fine at first, for about a day, then starts beeping


 Other than the beeping, there's no immediate indication of a problem, even if you cycle through the displays on the unit


 If you keep an eye on the unit over the next day or so, you'll notice that the battery meter gets lower and lower, despite the fact that the household power is on (as evidence of that, the non-battery backup outlets of the unit continue to supply power)


 Once the battery meter gets to zero, the battery backup outlets no longer function, and the unit reports the F5 and F6 failures.Note that the non-battery backup outlets continue to function, providing you with a very expensive surge suppressor, and that's what I'm using until Amazon delivers my newly ordered Cyberpower unit.I'm fairly sure the two APC units I tried were from different batches, as one had a manual that was in English only, and the other had a manual with multiple languages


 I don't know if APC has just designed a bad unit, or has started using cheap parts that fail under load, though I suspect the latter


 It's a shame, as I have an older 1500VA APC unit that I've had for more than five years, which is still going strong on its original battery.

 I've used it to make Skype Calls to Europe and to New Zealand with no problem at all

 Of course, the call quality also has to do with your Internet connection


 The only improvement that I would make is to put a little shutter over the camera lens, a shutter that you can open and close so no hackers can peek in from time to time
 Right now, I stick one of those little yellow stickynote papers on the top of the camera and bend the paper over the lens

 Other than that it's perfect!  I could highly recommend this to anyone.

While reading the owner's manual, I found a small entry in there about possible interference from plasma "displays," meaning TVs or monitors. Sure enough, when I turned off the TV but left the program playing via the cable box, the noise disappeared. So if you don't need to see what's actually on the TV, they work fine!I returned these headphones with a note to Amazon that this little tidbit should be more prominently mentioned before some other poor sap wastes their time setting them up only to have to return them.The headphones themselves seem to be fine as long as you don't plan to use them with a plasma TV. The construction and comfort were decent, the buttons were easy to use and the docking system for charging worked as described.My only complaint is the plasma problem not being mentioned on Amazon's item description page, which is why I gave a 1-star rating. I think anyone not using a plasma TV will probably find no problem with the headphones.

$review_text.: One of the best truly portable headphones you can get. Perfect for portable devices if you don't mind looking a little geeky with it's 80's styling. The next step up would be Grado SR60 or Sony MDR-v6 (which i own) but those are a lot bulkier and more expensive.It has very strong bass for its size. The only thing I would change is a better quality wire that lasts longer. On the plus side, it does have the Koss lifetime warranty (just pay the shipping).

$REVIEW.: The Amazon Kindle is a great tool and one the best things about it is how compact it is.  It weighs next to nothing and is thinner than the average cell phone.  While those are both great benefits, they also give the Kindle the feeling of being somewhat delicate.  Amazon makes a folio cover, but at $60 it's definitely a bit pricey.  I searched through Amazon for different options before settling on the Belkin sleeve and I think I made the right choice.While the Belkin sleeve is not a folio case, I think it is a much better option for protection.  When I throw the Kindle in my purse, I like that the case covers it from all angles and is tightly fitted to the shape of it.The inside of the case is lined with a very soft fuzzy material that protects the surface of the Kindle, front and back, from scratches.  The exterior material is water-proof, which is very nice and the zipper is weather sealed.  I can't imagine taking the risk of carrying my Kindle out in the rain, but I guess having the option to do so is always nice.Another nice feature is the front pocket (where the pleats) are.  The zippered pocket (also weather-sealed) is a great place to stow away the charger plug and cable.  This pocket is also padded so I'm not worried about the accessories being pressed into the surface of the Kindle and causing marks on it.I'm definitely glad I picked this over a folio case because I feel I'm getting way better protection at one third the price!

$review_text.: I've tried four different covers from different companies since buying my Kindle Fire last year and this one is the keeper.  My Fire fits in very snugly (there are four elastic corners that hold it in securely) and I have no fear that it will fall out.  The cover itself is beautiful and I've already received comments from others asking where I got it.  There is a little pocket on the inside front cover that you can slip paper into, if needed.  All in all, this Verso cover will be the one I'll be recommending if anyone asks.

I've never had to restart or troubleshoot the units since installing them.  The Aircams have gone through snow,  100 degree heat, and the wind of hurricane Sandy.Pros:- Durability- Simple install/configuration- Design- Price- AirVision is great, and will get even betterCons:- Must have some light for night viewing- Video quality is fair at best, but the price makes it worth it- No PTZ, zoom, etc.

$review_text.: I upgraded to the View from a Sansa e260. I liked the e260, but I had several issues with it: (1) Synch was clumsy and didn't always work. (2) the MicroSD slot wasn't very useful, since it forced me to synch in MSC mode. (3) Video playback was unwatchable, primarily due to the poor synch between audio and video on the device.The Sansa View addresses all of these issues pretty well. With 16 GB, I fon't need the MicroSD slot--the View synched all of my music, every video I had on my PC, and every photo I had on the PC, with 2 GB to spare. Wow!Synch is much cleaner. Synch uses Microsoft Sync Center and syncs to Windows Media Player without a hitch. And video is not bad. The player can play WMV and MP4 files natively, without having to fool with Sansa's Media Center application. There is a bit of artifacting in movies (jaggies when a fast move occurs), but movies are still watchable.I got this unit for planes and trains. I can throw it in my pocket without worrying about spare batteries or any of the other hassles I had with my larger screen video player. I think it's going to work well for that purpose.

$review_text.: First let's get this out of the way: you need to understand SquareTrade's warranties to appreciate them, and make appropriate decisions on them.  If you understand that the value of the warranty diminishes with your repair claims, then you're OK. The point of the ST warranty is to make sure your computer runs for the duration of the warranty period OR fix or replace it up to, or until, the face value of the warranty is met. Meaning: if you have warranted the computer for $1000, and it is repaired at a repair cost of $200, your remaining warranty is only good for $800 worth of additinoal repairs or refund during the warranty period. I understand this and think it is a fair policy which helps keep pricing affordable.My claims experience with SquareTrade is twofold. About a year into the warranty my touchscreen laptop had a screen problem. SquareTrade repaired it quickly. Unfortunately the screen still occassionally lost its touch ability, but this seemed more software based than hardware as a reboot would correct. All in all I was happy with the repair. The cost of the repair was valued at roughly $250, which seemed reasonable.About a year after that, in a rush, I unfortunately dropped the laptop and broke it severely. I felt terrible as this is my daughter's computer which she loves. Since we had Accidental Damage protection (thought we might need it for my daughter and not for me!) I frantically called SquareTrade. My call was taken care of quickly and professionally. I sent the laptop in and in 2 days was greeted with a warranty payment equal to the face amount minus the $250 previous repair charge. This allowed me to replace my daughter's computer quickly (and with less of a wallet impact) and not have an issue with her school work.Worked exactly as advertised by SquareTrade and I am very happy with their service. This experience will provide additional peace of mind to me should I ever need to make another claim (which I hope I do not) on any of the other items I have warranted with them.

$review_text.: ...although I should thank Amazon Warehouse for first sending me a busted-up 50" version of last year's C8000 or I may never have experienced the awesomeness of the 59" D8000!The great (and exhaustive) information at AVSFourm lead me to this beauty, which I purchased from BuyDig due to Amazon Warehouse hanging me up on a C8000 replacement, and then Amazon taking forever to get the new 2011 Samsungs into inventory and listed for sale. I've got mine paired up with aSamsung BD-D6700 3D Blu-ray PlayerusingAmazonBasics High Speed HDMI Cable. I wall mounted the set with aSanus Vlt14-B1 Super-Slim Tilt Mountbracket. I'm usingSamsung's SSG-3100GB 3D Glassesthat came as part of theShrek/Megamind 3D Starter Kit, which was included as a promotional item with this set.Regarding picture quality:- Simply outstanding. Crisp definition. True colors that aren't overly bright or artificial. Inky black blacks.- No ghosting or shadows. Great with fast action and camera panning. Haven't tried video games.- No sign of jutter or film effect; the high refresh rate makes any motion smooth and realistic, especially noticeable in-store when comparing this side-by-side with a lower refresh TV.- Not so hot as a PC monitor with respect to reading tiny text.If you're worried about the size possibly being too big:- I thought I was pushing my luck after my wife commented that the broken 50" C8000 that showed up at our front door (but was never mounted) looked "too big." And I'll admit, this 59" TV is huge, but once we sat back to enjoy it, I don't know how we suffered (*cough, cough*) with out 32" Trinitron tube for the past 14 years.- With whatever up-convert happens between our DVD player and the TV itself, standard definition movies still look fine on this set. No, they're not as amazingly crystal clear as high-def Blu-ray content, but they're not at all blocky as I had expected.- You will want to take advantage of any HD cable, satellite or over-the-air broadcasts you might have available. Standard definition television picture quality will make you crazy after knowing the cleanliness of HD. (In our case, we're sticking with Comcast's most basic service but added their converter box, and are paying them about $28 per month.)- The VESA mounting pattern on the back is 800mm x 600mm, the largest size the Sanus mount I linked to supports. It's probably worth checking that whatever mount you select is compatible with this pattern.3D movies on this set are simply outstanding. So far, I've only got the Shrek discs that came with Samsung's starter kit to view, though I've got a couple more on the way. The big screen gives a really perceptible depth effect when viewed from my normal sitting position approximately 10 feet away. But we have a wide room and even from viewing angles of 45 the effect is still present with only very minor drop-offs in color and brightness (the picture noticeably dims once the 3D glasses are powered on, especially when the room is bright).3D setup and playback is a cinch -- the sync signal is bluetooth, so each pair of glasses needs to be paired the first time used. Pairing involves nothing more than turning the glasses on, and since the bluetooth signal is bi-directional, the television recognizes when the glasses are activated and provides a brief pop-up indication in the lower left corner saying so.After that initial setup, inserting a 3D disk and pressing play is all that's required to get the show going. The TV even automatically powers on and switches to the correct input when I power up my Samsung player and insert a disk.During the day I've watched my movies with the bright overhead lights on, and daylight lighting the room through two large windows. The anti-reflective coating on the screen is excellent! There's no apparent glare, and the brightness of the screen even at the factory setting (if I recall correctly, it's initially set at brightness level 48) is more than enough overcome this ambient light, without washing out the deep, dark black levels. (The 3D glasses reflect lighted surfaces located directly behind my head; in this case a darker room is preferred lest I need to fashion side-shades for the glasses.) In a dark room, the picture is simply jaw-dropping.Even the built-in speakers of this set do an adequate job of getting the sound out. Fine in a pinch, but I think you'll agree it's no match for amping the audio through an AV receiver to external speakers (in our case, aDenon AVR-3311CIwhich supports HDMI 1.4a and 3D pass-through.)Samsung's QWERTY remote is really a huge leap forward from a standard numeric remote, but is slow and slightly awkward in use. The two-sided remote resembles a conventional numbers-only device on one side, beaming our traditional infrared signals. The keyboard side takes advantage of the D8000's bluetooth, and is therefore only compatible with the television, and not the Samsung DVD player, nor any other device.  The keyboard side of the remote even has a usable thumb sensor -- sort of like a track pad on a Blackberry or a thumb control on a laptop keyboard -- allowing easy cursor navigation of the built-in web browser and applications.However, try as they might, the remote + SmartTV web apps still leave a bit to be desired when compared to a PC interface. For instance, sites like Hulu and NBC won't play Flash video (which I was aware of prior to purchase). So instead, I connect my laptop viaSiig's USB to HDmi adapterto watch broadcast TV shows, and will switch to a PC with a HDMI-out video card sometime in the future.The television's Netflix capabilities are solid. My one gripe is that once I locate and begin watching a movie, but then pause it and return to finish it on a different day, it has taken me quite a bit of searching to re-find it. But once I do, it resumes where I left off, and all of the expected pause, fast forward and rewind functions work as expected. However, once inside the Netflix app, I'm locked out of accessing the television's menu, so I lose the ability to adjust picture (and audio, if using the TV speakers).There are a number of redundant SmartTV features between the television and my Samsung DVD player, and if it were truly "smart," might it not somehow combine these Samsung web apps so that I'm only dealing with one Netflix, one YouTube, one browser, etc.? Because it sure would be nice to use the QWERTY remote on everything, including Pandora, which (I believe) isn't available as an application on the television. As it is, each application has its own login process, with the Netflix process being quite different from Pandora or YouTube, for instance.The YouTube app needs improvement. It doesn't make use of the remote's QWERTY keypad, and instead requires the user to use the cursor buttons to scroll around the on-screen virtual keyboard to conduct a video search. Instead, I use the TV's built-in web browser to access YouTube, which works pretty well, even in full-screen mode.The most desirable part of the Facebook app would be the photo viewer, which for some inexplicable reason won't take advantage of the full screen size -- even for photos that were uploaded at full resolution. This makes showing off baby and vacation pictures a bit of a yawner. The photos tend to be small and a little washed out, though easy to navigate between albums. The rest of the Facebook application is cumbersome to navigate, read and update, and never seems to fully load.One last comment, regarding some criticism I've read regarding the television's silver bezel: it really isn't a stand-out issue. In a dark room, you'll never see it. In a lighted room, it doesn't pop out to me like it does in the product shots shown here and on other sites. It really is a flat finish that doesn't reflect back a whole lot of light, it blends nicely with the glass overlay, and isn't something I'm ever conscious of.Samsung has put together a really nice television here at an attractive price, packed with lots of features and a stunning picture. I simply can't imagine anything to complain about and enthusiastically recommend anyone looking to check one of these out at a local electronics store to be wowed by its brilliance.

$REVIEW.: I just received this adapter and installed it almost without any problems.  The instructions in the booklet for inserting the card were different from the software--one said to turn off your computer.  I tried it without turning it off and it worked (sort of).  After completing the installation I still didn't have an interent or networking connection and the signal strenght was poor.  (We have a Linksys wireless router--about five feet away).After going through the help screen in the utility menu about four times--it was no help.  I finally figured out that it needed the ssid--it didn't detect it automatically (like the usb version does).  To make a long story short--I finally manually inputted the ssid and after tinkering a little more it worked.
$SUMMARY.: Didn't work at first--frustrationville!

$review_text.: There is a huge bug in Windows 7 (Home) that I ran into when I bought a second WD Elements USB drive to act as a backup to my first WD Elements USB drive, both models the same size (2TB). I found that when I plugged in the new second drive, it was not recognized by the system, no disk letter was assigned, it didn't show up in Explorer. I got the normal USB sound plugging it in, and in fact in Device Manager both drives were there, and clicking on them I was told both were working OK.I know the new 2TB drive I received was not damaged, because if I plugged it in alone, i.e. with my existing 2TB WD drive removed, it worked fine. Plug in the two drives in any order and only one or the other will show up in Explorer! The other stays hidden with no drive letter assigned and inaccessible.Good news is that after about four hours work researching this and trying things, I got both drives working. I will explain below how I did it.First I want to curse out Microsoft (and WD too). This is a horrible bug, USB drives are supposed to be plug and play. I'm an engineer, so was able to plow though some technical forum postings, but most non-techies would be stumped by this. Buying a second drive to act as a backup has got to be fairly common, this is not an unusual configuration. The cursing applies to WD too, because this problem is known to them, in fact I found the hint on one of their forums for the solution. I read that WD metaphorically shrugs and blames Microsoft, but by providing no insert in the disk drive packaging to warn and/or provide a work around, they are just leaving their customers hanging.I started my research by searching the Amazon reviews and found some tips and tricks that had worked for others to get a single WD drive recognized, but none of them worked in this case. Here is what I tried: reversed the order of plugging in USB cable and drive power, added some media, i.e. put the new empty drive on another computer and copied over a file to it, renamed the new drive so drives had different names, enabled/disabled the drives in Device Manager, and rebooted a bunch of times. All to no avail.Here's what did work. I had read on a WD forum that one user with the same problem had gotten his drives working by plugging both drives into a Window7 Pro. His explanation had something to do with the computer needing to reassign signatures when two drives are the same, and he guessed that Windows Home for some reason (bug!!) is unable to do this, but his other machine could. At that point he was able to move the drives back to Windows Home, and they now were both recognized, the signatures apparently fixed (permanently) by the other machine.I have an old Windows XP machine, so I used that. I just plugged both 2TB WD drives into the XP and let them sit for a minute or two until their drive lights stopped flashing, and sure enough when I moved them back to my Window7 Home machine, both drives now displayed in Explorer and both could be accessed. I later was able to fully copy the contents of the first drive to the second.Microsoft's incompetence is dragging down the USA's technical reputation. Not only does Windows7 file search not work right, Windows7 System Restore is so buggy that it is not reliable, but now I find that its plug and play can't handle two identical drives!

$review_text.: This camera worked well after six months, but in the past week, after the camera opened, it stayed open and beeped, saying "Lens error, restart camera."  Google this term and the Canon 1100IS and you'll see many people with the same problem.A shame since I've bought numerous Canon cameras over the years and have found them to work flawlessly.  There's even a class-action suit over this to get them to acknowledge the problem with the 1100IS.  Google that and you'll find info on that too.UPDATE:  I've read accounts of owners who send Canon the camera in for servicing within the warranty period and for their troubles are told that it's their fault instead of a production flaw.  I sent in mine prepared for the worst, but they ended up fixing it!  So in my case, they honored the warranty. I'd give the product 3 stars now, but Amazon doesn't let you change the original rating.

$REVIEW.: The Mipow BOOMAX is different from most other Bluetooth speakers I've used because it has dual 3 W drivers for true stereo


 It also has a very stylish design with a durable anodized aluminum alloy body and grille and a detachable soft-touch plastic handle for portability.The Bluetooth pairs easily as MiPow_BOOMAX and the aptX codec provides impeccable transmission


 Sound quality is better than most other miniature rechargeable portable speakers because of the dual drivers

 It also has a bit better bass than most, partly because of two equalizer settings, but the sound is otherwise what would be expected for something so tiny:  fun and enjoyable, though not audiophile-quality.The battery will last for at least ten hours and a 3.5 mm audio cable is included
 It can support connecting two phones at the same time, but I haven't experimented with that.

$review_text.: We had a black out caused by a storm about a year ago. Well after the 3rd days with no power, hot shower and a frig that was warm &amp; rancid milk, I was desperate.  I have a family with 3 small children to care for. Well my neighbor works for the company that manufactures these cables as an engineer and has always bragged about how great they were. Well he was kind enough to lone me a half dozen cables of a new prototype design and I gave them a go.Not only was my house power back up to normal with in minutes but as I was standing there in awe my head started to itch. I mean really itch, I started scratching my bald head and felt fuzz all over my previously bald head. I rushed into the bathroom and looked into the mirror. To my surprise my hair was growing back before my eyes. I was in shock, you could see it growing as you watched. With in 45 minutes my hair had grown back completely! I have looked like Mr. Potato head for 20 years and suddenly I have a full head of hair again. Only one thing could have caused this! "IT WAS THE PROTOTYPE CABLES". That wasn't the end of it either. I herd my wife crying and rushed into our bedroom. I thought she was in pain but they were tears of happiness. She was standing in front of  the mirror with a brand new set of 38D's and a 24 inch waist, and she is 48 years old. But now she looked 28 years old.I could go on and on about these cables and all they have done for us. (Like my three children winning the Nobel peace prize and how they solved world hunger, BUT I will do that in another post when I update my experience with these incredible cables) These cables are worth every cent. I am a believer and so is my entire family. Pick up a dozen "NOW"! It will change your life. I'm not sure how they work, and my IQ is now 658 up from 108 (those cables again). Its could be the Noise-Dissipation System and the Counter-Spiral Geometry but my bet its really the flamadootles unversed to the square mean ratio vortex, coupled with their patented inner freshness lock &amp; seal package. I will post updates soon on any new benefits derived from this product.

Break in time, run slides first, hrs. of some sort of prep, please. Picture is outstanding out of the box with a few personal tweaks, colors bright and warm, blacks are rich and depth of picture beautiful in 2d.  3d is otherworldly, I have viewed 3d blu rays with Sony 3d blu ray and 3d content on cable using Samsung active shutter glasses (2 came with Shrek package for free).  Based on the source, holy cow! Immersive, great color and accuracy, no halos, no blurring, awesome. Viewing distance of 3d from 12 feet to 20 feet and images still look good.Samsung 2d to 3d conversion actually helps old dvds look richer along with player upconversion.  Blu rays show greater depth but of course don't pop off screen. Effective 600 Mhz speed of plasma really just awesome when watching sports and action, again, no blurring.  TV is easy to set up, remote is average, built in wireless internet interface has great potential but the D7000 does not have a browser. Directs you to sites to rent video content, read USA Today, check Accuweather, or purchase apps, etc.  A browser is available on the D8000 with a qwerty keyboard built into the remote.  For another $300, that is my only regret so far. 4 hdmi inputs, a usb, pc and more. I don't really like the stand like another reviewer mentioned and will consider a future wall mount. For such a thin bezel the speakers are adequate but I almost always use my Denon receiver and it's 7.1 capable surround sound. This is a great tv.  All my friends and family love this plasma.Dennis R.

$REVIEW.: This radio has some pretty cool features for the price.The USB port can be used to support Large Disks (I had a 500gb western digital hard drive connected) although the interface is a bit lacking for such large libraries, there is still a "scroll" through folders


To make this easy to use there needs to be a little forethought into the names of your folders and how the structure is made.The EQs are a bit lacking, but they can be used to take care of problem frequencies on mid to high end speakers.The "rear input" is a bit misleading


You'll need a special connector to take advantage of that.Also, only 4 preamp outputs sucks


You cannot run Front/rear/subwoofer


You can only do front/sub or front/rear

$REVIEW.: A while ago, I wrote a review of this product entitled &amp;quot;Very cool, but flimsy...&amp;quot; in which I indicated that, even though the expandable  Palm keyboard had changed the way I worked with my Palm V, I'd had some  problems with it.  A few days ago, I was contacted by the president of the  manufacturer (not his administrative assistant), offering to replace my  keyboard.  I got the FedEx a day later with my replacement keyboard.  This  kind of concern for my satisfaction impresses me as much as the thinking  behind the keyboard itself.  As a result of this very positive experience,  I need to amend my original review from a lukewarm 3 to an enthusiastic 5.  The product's still a great one, but the company's focus on the customer  makes it even better.

I was using RG6 quad shield, and it's a real challenge to shove these things into the cable.  I have the Paladin compression tool and new flaring tool / reamer, but I still end up with about a 30% failure rate where the connector shoves the outer insulation down instead of sliding over and getting a good compression seal.  I'm going to try some regular RG6 to see if the thinner insulation and reduced amount of shielding (just one layer of wire and one of foil) makes it easier to more reliably crimp these on.  Hopefully it will.Now, that problem isn't technically the fault of the connectors - it'd be true of any connector like this.  I don't have the issue with F connectors, since I can thread those onto another tool and really push them down; these are just hard to grab and shove onto quad shield.  But the connectors themselves are of a high quality.  The ring grips tightly, the pin fits snugly, and I'm confident that they are connecting the the female RCA jack solidly.  If you get them on right, you will not be able to pull them off of the cable.The color rings that come with the package are little colored rubber-ish o-rings which slide over the cable before you crimp the end on.  If I remember correctly, there are 2 yellows, 2 each of red, green, and blue, and 2 more of the red and 4 white.  So, with 10 ends in the package, you could do 5 cables - 3 component video and 2 audio.  Or a composite video cable and 4 audios.  Assuming you don't screw any ends up. :)Note that these are identical to the ones sold at Home Depot under a different name, "gator cable" or something like that.  Amazon has a better price if you can wait a day or two for shipping.

$REVIEW.: The charger and batteries arrived just in time for a photo taking trip and I was very please that I had purchased the package


The charger housing is compact and fits perfectly in my camera bag

I really appreciated the option of being able to charge at home but also having a car connector just in case (it has happened to me in the past that I needed to get more juice to keep taking shots) so I was really very pleased.The screen protector and cleaning cloth were icing on the cake in my book


Everything you would need to stay on the go and keep shooting is in this package
I love it!

Spent almost 12 days configuring it but Microsoft Technical support could not configure it with my D-Link DI-624 Super G router. They were not able to setup encryption key and was not able to detect my wireless network. Microsoft transfers their tech. support calls to Far East country like India and most Level 1 support technicians don't know much beyond simple manual reading knowledge. Worst, their manager used to call me  after midnight. Is that a time to call back??? At least they should check which time zone they are calling. And in middle of night asking my e-mail address where he can send solution?? After having their case open more than 10 days he still couldn't find my e-mail address in their database with my ticket. Worst technical support. If u want to be bothered in middle of night like 1 a.m. buy this one and enjoy harassment.

You also have the original creator of the page change the quality of their product at some point and leave it under the same listing

This is done for a variety of reasons, not all of which are nefarious.We buy a lot of different electronics for different businesses, so we have ordered many times from different sellers under the same listing
And since Amazon will not differentiate reviews based on the actual seller, we are going to try and collect reviews of items from specific sellers

If we ordered the item, we will note it
If we collect the information from another reviewer, we will note that as well
Lastly, we'll put the date of the purchase or posting of the original review


Hopefully this will help buyers under this listing determine the proper item AND seller to purchase.The star rating will go up or down based on how many good or bad products show up overall.Important Note: It is still possible that a seller may change their product at any time, even after a review is posted, so keep that in mind

You are most likely to receive the product matching the review if order one that is FULFILLED BY AMAZON
This is because sellers will generally send in large quantities to the Amazon warehouse at one time.------------2/14 Seller: Cable-Mix - Ordered by us


Bulk packaging polybagged


25FT
Gold Connectors
Appears to be 28AWG

Black Cable w/ Black/Striped Connectors


Had problems with highest resolutions....


This listing is a good example of another problem where a seller will list a high quality item to get the rating up, and then change the listing to a lower quality product

We have ordered from this listing many times before, and I would rate the quality of the cable as 5 Stars, Excellent
However, the last few orders we placed for this listing have been poor quality


It's such a huge difference that I'm surprised they would go that far down in grade

Also, this was a listing for 25FT HDMI cables for the longest time, but as of this review, it is for different lengths and quantities
Seeing as how all the original reviews were for 25FT cables of a certain grade, it's really rather underhanded to completely change it to something else


This seller was one of our top suppliers, on Amazon and elsewhere, but I doubt we will continue to order from them in the future
Beware this one.

I'm a pretty techy guy, but it was not easy for me to figure out what this thing is or why anyone would want it. Setting it up was easy, but then I just stared at it wondering, ok, now what? I contacted Pogoplug support and at the end of this review you can read through the somewhat frustrating exchange I had with them. Finally, through it all, I figured this thing out. So for those who find themselves as confused as I was, NOW THE SECRET CAN BE REVEALED!!!!Pogoplug is a little black box you plug into your router, and then attach an external hard drive (or an SD Card) to. This then gives you access to the files on the hard drive from any internet connected computer. So for example, let's say there's a document you want to work on at home and at work, or a music collection or video collection you want to have access to from multiple locations, you could put it on the drive attached to the Pogoplug, and then have access to it from any internet connected computer. You log on to their website and can access your files from there.What's good about it?-Set up was easy.-It gives you access to your files from any internet connected device, including your smart phoneWhat's bad about it?-To access the files you need to go through their website or their software. While the device is easy to setup, the software is confusing. There are two versions, the blue "browser" software and the pink software. This is where a user manual would really help. In fact, I didn't even know about the pink software until after my exchange with support. I'm still confused about the difference.-Support is about what you'd expect. Likely outsourced based on the grammar issues in their reply, and their initial answers were not responsive to my questions.Final analysis. I have this thing 4 stars because it does what it claims to do. Whether that's something you will find useful or not is up to you.And now, for your entertainment, my email exchange with Pogoplug support. Draw your own conclusions:I was sent a Pogoplug from Amazon Vine to review. I have it working. I've put files on the device and on the cloud storage. I put the app on my phone. Now what? I really don't understand what this thing does, or what I'm supposed to be doing with it. Given that there is cloud storage, what good is the device itself? What does it do that I couldn't do with the cloud storage? Do I have to be within a certain distance of the device for my phone to access it? Can I access it remotely? How? I'm completely confused. Any help you could offer would be appreciated.===Hello Pogoplug,Thank you for contacting Pogoplug Support.Let me answer your question by telling you what Pogoplug does do.Pogoplug is a media-centric accessory that transforms your typical USB drive into an easy plug-n-play storage from which you can easily share your personal media to friends and family. You can share folders of Movies, Music and Photos easily via email, Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace. You can even create slideshows on Pogoplug and share those as well. This is just a short list of the great features incorporated into Pogoplug and Pogoplug Service, included free for the life of your purchase.Kind Regards,-Fiana===Doesn't really answer my question, but thanks for trying.Let's try this one question at a time:1. Given that there is cloud storage, what good is the device itself?===Hello,Thank you for the update.Let me try to refer to all your questions:Q: Given that there is cloud storage, what good is the device itself?A: All Pogoplug user receives free 5G storage on our cloud. The Pogoplug device allows you to have the ability to both keep the data stored on your attached hard drive on your home and you have the ability to simply eject the hard drive and the ability to access data when needed as well as the ability to attach a large amount of storage to your device (You have 4 USB port which you can attach any hard drive up to 4G).Q: Do I have to be within a certain distance of the device for my phone to access it? Can I access it remotely? How?A: Once you attached a hard drive to your Pogoplug device in the following configuration (Modem -&gt; Router -&gt; Pogoplug device -&gt; HD), you have the ability to view the stored data from remote access from any location in the world via the following platforms:- my.pogoplug.com by signing in with your credentials.- The Pogoplug Browser (Blue icon) - it is mainly meant for preforming backup to your Pogoplug devices as well as to view all the data stored on your Pogoplug. You can download the Browser from the following link:[..]- The Pogoplug Software (Pink icon) - it is mainly meant to map the Pogoplug drives on your computer as well as to turn your computer into your own personal cloud by setting files/folders stored on your computer to remote access. You can download the software from the following link:[..]- Pogoplug App on your mobile device (iPhone/Android)/I hope this information helps.Best regards,Fiana===You state, "You have 4 USB port which you can attach any hard drive up to 4G"There is only one USB port.I'm not sure what you mean by "any hard drive up to 4G". That would be a very small hard drive.===Hello,Thank you for the update.There is 4 USB ports on Pogoplug mobile series 4 (new) device ( you are correct regarding the regular Pogoplug mobile, it has one usb port and one SD card slot).I'm sorry for the confusion the drives you can attach to Pogoplug should be up to 4 TB.Kind Regards,Fiana

In fact, I was afraid there would be issues with case crowding or interference with other components.I installed this cooler on an Asus M32N SLI WiFi (Nvidia 590) motherboard with a newly added Phenom 9850.  I opted to replace the Cooler Master (that also worked well) on my old X2 5200+ chip since it was already 2+ years old.  It also let me evaluate the Zalman.I had two concerns when I opened the box: clearance for my newly added Corsair Dominator (1066) RAM that has a very high profile due and the weight.  To my great relief, it fits perfectly.  The jury is still out on the weight and I presently have my tower case laying horizontal until I work up the nerve to stand it up.  The installation bar is sturdy but I will reiterate: the unit is heavy and without question I will remove it before moving the system any large distance.Finally, I couldn't be more pleased with the results.  The stock Black Box AMD heat sink / fan is so loud it makes my office sound like an airport (that has been my experience with all AMD stock fans).  The system with AMD stock fan with no over-clocking caused CPU temperatures in the 59 to 61 Celsius range.  The new Z9500 AM2 dropped the temperature 10%: my system is running at 55 degrees with the fan speed set in the middle range.  Nice.There are less expensive options, for example CoolerMaster products that I know work great with very low fan noise.  But given the temperature drop and silent fan options, you can't go wrong with the Zalman 9500 AM2.

Worth it.I didn't buy it from Amazon since I wanted the extra height extension. That was completely unnecessary. At my height (5'11) this stand is more than high enough to read comfortably while standing up. Also, the extra extension takes a bit of effort to add/remove (requires screwing/unscrewing the thickest tube at the base) since it has no telescoping abilities.Other thoughts: it'd be neat if I could easily hot swap my Kindle Paperwhite with my Nexus 10, but the different sizes of these devices make this a bit of a challenge (only 4 small elastic cords to hold device corners provided with this product). At the moment I'm just using the Kindle app. On the other hand, Amazon does sell 1mm round elastic cords... heh. Added to cart.

The memory foam case is a nice touch, it does a great job of absorbing and shock from a fall.I believe another review commented that the sound from the velcro was too loud...my ears must not be that sensitive


Yes, it sounds like you are opening velcro, but it is not that loud.Buy with confidence, this is a quality product.

$REVIEW.: I guess I'm not alone with the "frozen" player. It worked great for 2 months then stuck on start screen. I had already registered it on the sandisk website so I sent an e-mail to tech support.They replied the same day with some things to do to re-boot it. I tried and it didn't work so I e-mailed them back and within 6 hours they e-mailed me a pre-paid shipping label and a return authorization number. I shipped it off and received a brand new player within 6 days. They did not make me return it through Amazon and I put the player by itself into a padded envelope.Did not have receipt,original box or paperwork of any kind. Sandisk customer service is one of the best I have delt with and I work in purchasing and deal with hundredes of companies.If I have any problems with this one I will take the same steps again.I would also like to say that both of my children have the 1GB version of this sandisk and they have worked without a glitch for 6 months now, and my 11 year olds throw them in their backpacks, their desks, their pockets etc...they have really taken a beating and still work and sound great.

$REVIEW.: I bought this after reading several reviews of people that have had this for some time; now I understand why it seems to last for so long: it is really sturdy, and after a quick glance at the instructions it's very easy to use. I'm 6 feet tall and can easily get a Canon 30D at eye level.Everything seems easy to control with precision, which is a big reason why you'd get this over a cheaper model.You can leave a quick-release post on the camera, so it's a good idea to buy more of those if you have several cameras; you can also take the whole pan head out. You can even mount the camera on one of the posts - slick indeed!One thing I didn't get - Adorama didn't have it at the time - was a bag; do get one, it would be a shame to scrape this while transporting it.

More importantly, it didn't even work!! I thought I must have done something wrong because it should just work, right?! I scoured the internet and found that these powerline adapters should work across circuits while others say they do not

So what gives?! The netgear adapters, when plugged in at opposite ends of the house and on separate circuits, did not work at all
These adapters from ZyXEL worked perfectly in the exact same configuration
I plugged one into the back of my router and plugged it into the wall


I plugged the other one into the back of my computer and plugged it into the wall

And it worked!! There was very minimal loss to speed as well with less than 1mb slowdown


Now to be fair, I don't know of any internet service out there that would provide speeds up to 200mbps, so there is no way to test if it truly is capable of this, but I'm completely content with the fact that it just works and now rooms that are too far away from the wireless signal can have a good, constant connection with no drops or loss in speed

I really had my doubts after the netgear failure and considering my home is pushing 70 years old, but I couldn't have hoped for a better result
Brilliant!

$review_text.: I was an early adopter for this camera when it first came out. It was my first 4/3 lens. I purchased it after the whole craze started boiling down and the prices became decent. Later I traded this camera for a white version, which was the same in every aspect, but was a glossy white instead of a matte black.The GF-1 offers great quality that surpasses that of a point and shoot (and interchangeable lenses!) but still of course, lower than that of a full sized DSLR.Why would I want to go with an in-between? Because the GF1 paired with the 20mm pancake is still years ahead of DSLR in terms of portability.I've taken this camera along with me to activity-intensive areas, such as hiking/climbing in Hawaii, climbing the lower slopes of Mt. Rainier, international traveling through Taiwan, Japan, Lebanon and various other places, bike rides through the neighborhood to as far as forests in Canada, to fishing trips just in the Puget Sound area. I even fought off zombies in a 24-hour intensive Humans vs Zombies larp with this thing tucked into a pocket. Now tell me you'd do the same thing with your EOS 7D/Mark II.Don't pay any attention to the crap that makes up the GF2-3-4-5+ editions of the GF series. Panasonic's greatest release was the first, much like the Canon S95 is better than the S100 (we'll ignore the S90 of course). If you really want an upgrade, consider the GX1, which is what I ended up grabbing after a few years, as I loved the body of the GF1 too much to go towards round crap offered by the GF2+.The best lens you can invest in as a staple lens is the 20mm pancake. This thing retains its value because it is THE lens to have on you at all times. Do whatever else you want with the other lenses, but know that that's the first one you should make sure you have.

$REVIEW.: Works well and is rated CAT6 so it's backwards compatible with existing network equipment while offering lower crosstalk and system noise. Cable itself does not have any CAT6 labeling so there is no way to distinguish it from CAT5. Gold plated contacts are a nice feature.

$review_text.: Since this is my first GPS, I really have no way to compare whether this GPS is "better" than others. I can only describe my experiences with it.I first used the GPS locally (southeastern PA) to test it out since I had an upcoming trip to VT where I planned to really use it. I wanted to make sure I'd know how to use the controls. I used the GPS while taking public transit to see what it would say the best route was. I also used it while walking near my home and Philly to see if it knew small local streets. The GPS performed well (detouring whenever I went in unexpected directions) during these tests. There are settings to change your mode of transport to bike, bus, car/truck, foot, etc. and I used many of these modes. I never encountered any streets that weren't known and this surprised me since these maps are from 2006 and there is tons of construction. Speaking of which, that was one of my complaints: that 2006 maps are included with a late 2007 sold product. I think it should have the maps of the year it is sold in.Then came my trip to VT which I pre-mapped using Google on the way up thinking I'd see if the GPS agreed with the route I took. I had dragged my Google Map directions so that I could avoid the interstate routes that went through NJ. My route was PA-&gt;NY-&gt;VT on the way up. The Google map directions got me confused around the NY/VT border with some road names I couldn't find, but the GPS led me the rest of the way to Stowe, VT. I had absolutely no problems; I did not get lost once using the route the Nuvi 370 told me to take, even when I accidentally missed a turn and the route changed. Incidentally, it takes about 10-30 seconds to recalculate routes and I was pleased with that. In fact, the only slow point is when I first turned on the Nuvi and it took as long as 3 minutes to "acquire satellites."I then used the Nuvi around Stowe and found pretty much everything I punched in, including some not-so-run-of-mill places I wanted to visit. Some of the roads were dirt roads, but they were considered finished (just sort of backwoods, which seemed typical near some of the hiking spots I went to). The Nuvi did fail in finding Mt. Elsmore State Park since it took me to someone's house in the woods. It was definitely not a ranger station or park office. That was it's only failure.Coming home I allowed the GPS to completely figure my route. I had previously set the GPS for "shortest distance," but once I changed it to "fastest route" it put me back on interstates, which is where I wanted to be after all of those one-lane (in each direction) VT roads. Another small problem I had was the Nuvi's insistence on calling road name changes "turns", which sometimes caused me to wonder whether I missed something. I realized that all I really did was change roads so from then on I ignored the word "turn" if I saw I was not supposed to physically turn. Also, I never used the sound so I was going strictly by looking at the GPS. I prefer listening to music so I figured I might not hear the turns anyway. I used the mileage to each turn to remember to change directions or roads.If you click the bottom left of the screen (Expected Arrival Time when you're routing), you can get a view of the trip information like fastest and average speeds as well as mileage and total time. Clicking the top where the current routing info is (like the road you are on and the very next upcoming turn) lets you see quite a few more steps in the future, which I also found useful.All in all, I believe this GPS (which I bought here on Amazon) was well worth the money even though the maps are old-ish, the travel kit and languages come separately, the warm-up time is a little long, and I could not get it to stick to the dash (I placed it in the driver's cup holder instead since the dash of my car is too slanted to reach). I will be using my Nuvi 370 often.

$review_text.: You can't really stack these cuz the hd will probably overheat if blocked from the air, but I think I like the lay-flat rather than upright docking.  They transfer your data fast if hooked to USB 3.0, but equally as well being backward compatible with USB 2.0.  I am using one of each at present.  They are typically easy to undock, like others, but I like that the frame holds them snugly on the sides and the rear is open.

Have used Fotodiox M42 to Eos adapter without the AF chip, and was quite happy with it.

If you decided to program Dandelion Chip, in aperture priority (AV) mode pictures might come out slightly overexposed, that's due to camera doing double light metering off of Aperture value from dandelion chip, but it's not a problem if you're using your camera in full Manual mode. No other issues.Conclusion: it does what it suppose to and does it quite well. Just don't expect it to do impossible things such as improve picture quality or whatever.

$review_text.: My criteria when selecting my radio were that it be a CD receiver head unit that:1. Plays mp3 formats;2. Has integrated Bluetooth for phone calls;3. Has some sort of auxiliary input for an external music player; and4. Costs less than $200.Additionally, this radio has the following:1. Dual USB (plus the standard input jack); and2. Bluetooth AD2P (music transfer via bluetooth).I am very happy with my purchase. If I could make one or two comments based on some of the reviews for this model (and the KD-R800):First, Bluetooth connections are really finnicky. Do your homework and make sure that your phone supports the appropriate Bluetooth version (in this case, version 2.0). My phone is a crummy "dumb phone," and though it isn't on JVC's list of devices (it is Bluetooth 2.0), it works just fine. Getting your radio to link up with your phone requires getting the radio to make a connection with the phone, and the phone to make a connection with the radio. If this isn't done correctly, your phone will not want to automatically connect to the radio when you start your car back up. It is an exercise that requires two pieces of equipment (your radio AND your phone), and so those that proclaim in their reviews that the problem is with the radio may not always be 100% accurate in their analysis.Next, comments have been made (also in reference to the KD-R800; discussion is appropriate here because the mic is the same for both models) about the quality of the microphone and the "ugly" factor of having the exposed wire running on the inside of your car. The mic connection is a standard mic plug. If you really do not like the mic included, you can get a new one. As for the ugliness, it is really pretty easy to hide mic wire. I ran mine underneath the dash panels and snaked it out just above my steering wheel. Done that way, it is invisible. I did the same thing with the rear USB plug. It comes out next to my emergency brake and is hidden the whole way.All in all, this is a great radio for the price and I am far from disappointed.

 I decided to go with this board because, when doing the product comparison, those more expensive models really don't add that much more value to justify the price


 One thing it's missing is 1394 port but I just bought a $20 1394 PCIe card to handle my video import for my HD camcorder.I installed this into my HAF 922 mid tower chassis and had no problems whatsoever

 The back panel fit perfectly (ATX) into the chassis back slot and the SATA 3 6 GB/s ports are awesome
 The BIOS is top notch and it comes with software that "safely" does the OC for you.The PCI slots are a little tight--especially if you plan on using a fat GPU


 I installed a GeForce GTX 560 and it took up two back panel slots

 I know that the ATX form factor limits what the manufacturer can do--however, it seemed they could have squeezed a few more millimeters between the PCIe x16 and PCIe x1 slots.Overall, I recommend this MOBO for novice to intermediate DIY people.

$review_text.: Bought this for my Asus 300T.  For the money, this case can't be beat.  It's a very slim case, and when closed it looks just like a little black book.  The two viewing angles are just fine.  There is no portrait mode angle.  It's easy to slip the tablet in and out of the case, for when you don't need that much protection, and it only takes a few seconds to do so.  There are magnets in the cover to hold it closed.  There's also a little stylus holder on the side, and some business card holders built into the inside of the cover.The only think I don't understand are the two semi-circles above the business card holder.  I can't figure out what they are there for.  Anyone?UPDATE 04/18/13.  The case has stretched so badly that it's unusable.  The flap that holds the tablet into the case no longer positions the tablet so that the usable sections are not obscured.  Nothing lines up any more.  The opening around the power connection has frayed.  Trying to use an HDMI cable while the tablet is in the case is a giant pain.  I guess for the money and the amount of time I got out of it, it wasn't a horrible deal.  Even with a three year warranty I'm not returning it.  Better cases are out there now.

Also if you remove the small rubber grommet from the top of the remote you can plug the cable into it, and your camera on the other, for a wired intervalometer (timer) remote configuration.The wireless has been reported to have excellent range, and went through a few apartments worth of wall this evening just fine.The vendor got it to me in 6 days.You will not be able to extend the shutter past its already stated 15 seconds. But full manual, A, P, S, Auto, Bracketing all work fine. Changing camera settings between exposures, does not effect the timer settings.You can program a delay before starting , hours, minutes, seconds etc. 1-99 exposures or set it to limitless exposures. Also a 1 second continuous exposure always available with this model as long as you have not programmed something longer in camera. There is a bulb setting I didn't mess with. But the meat and potatoes of the gizmo works just fine.

$review_text.: When it worked this was a handy drive


I used it with a WDTV Live to stream video, as well as with WD2Go apps on my ios devices


The included backup software was miserable and brought my systems to a crawl while it ran so had to uninstall.The activity light on the front of the unit died after about eight months, but the drive still functioned so I ignored it

The drive stopped being recognized on the network today - one year and two weeks after purchase - and cannot be restored

It is likely I can remove the hard drive to recover data but haven't tried yet.This is becoming commonplace - where hardware is being designed to last about the length of the warranty and not much more.I have a hard time looking at a warranty as an expiration date on the products I buy, but like many others this has become one of them.:'(

$review_text.: I bought this to go into my separate carport.  I spent HOURS trying to get this to work.  I called their support line, but after ten minutes and two pick-ups only to put me immediately back on hold, I gave up.  I first tried to connect to the camera wirelessly.  That did not work so I plugged it into the modem.  That connected it, but it never focused.  It was just a blurry mess.  Believe me, I tried everything in my arsenal to get this thing to work.  Future attempts to connect it wirelessly also failed so I finally packed up the whole she-bang and sent it right back.  I will update my post if I find a surveillance camera that works.3/30/14- Bought a Foscam Fi8908w as soon as my return for this one was processed.  It connected right away and has been working ever since.

$REVIEW.: After ordering this docking station, I found that I cannot use it for my setup.  First of all, it will only accept a DVI video connector, which I do not have for my monitor.  Secondly, I share my keyboard, monitor and mouse between two different computers, using theStarTech 2 Port Professional USB KVM Switch Kit with Cables (SV231USB)to switch between them.  One computer is a laptop and the other is my main desktop.  I thought it might, but this docking station will not work with this configuration because the laptop must be connected to the docking station for it to use the monitor, keyboard and mouse.If you want a cheaper solution, you could instead buy a KVM switch similar to the StarTech and just connect the peripherals to that.  Then when you want to use the laptop with the periperals, simply plug in the KVM's USB plug to the laptop and you're good to go.  And with this solution, you also get the ability to connect another laptop or desktop to the same peripherals!  Voila.

I was in the market for a FM pocket sized radio with good quality and in my search I found this one, it was not much more price wise and had Short Wave (Which is also an interest of mine) MW (AM) a voice recorder and MP3 capabilities. Its the perfect size I was looking for its only slightly bigger the an I-POD classic, fits easily in a shirt pocket, it was some weight to it, so its not flimsily. Sound in the speaker is pretty good, its 50 mm and it produces a descent sound. It DX's in FM station really well, does good with middle wave (AM) (I live in a location with bad reception-one reason I got this radio is I have an Sirius XM radio and I transmit it around the house and property and I can listen to it on FM it works perfectly) and the short wave is to be expected in that it DX's in the big boomers, your probably not going to DX in far away lower powered stations, but its not bad. Its pretty easy to use and there's lots of per sets on all three bands. The MP3 recorder is easy to use, you just plug it into your computer and drag music into its folder. Battery life (rechargeable) is very good, You can get 10-15 hours, or more. It takes 7 hours to fully charge and more if you use the computer like 9-10 hours. Its not a bad radio at all.

Because I am installing a single din HU.  I could not find a cubbie box for under the HU so I bought this and eat the extra price for the reset of the kit (face plate).  Again, to make sure the cubbie din fits right.Nothing will work for Subarus with digital auto climate control A/C unit except this.[...]Pricey as it comes with a new A/C unit and then the double din opening above it. The HU is tied to the A/C unit for the auto A/C types. So, no options if you want aftermarket HU. I ordered mine and should arrive in a few days.  Also order the Hazard Button from the same site, as this one is on the other side.

When I first connected this unit to my two computers, it worked flawlessly for half a day
I was in KVM heaven, no special setup was needed
At the end of the day, however, computer 2 stopped responding to the keyboard and mouse

As of now, the monitor switching still works, but I am back to two keyboards and two mice

Also, StarTech support today confirmed with me by telephone that switching the cables does not fix the problem with "computer 2" not responding to mouse and keyboard, meaning the problem is with their unit in port 2


Whichever computer is connected to port 1 works fine


I am returning this unit for a refund
The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it somewhat works, but it is close to the same as using no KVM.

One of the things about buying an OPPO is it's resale value over other electronics, I don't know of too many brands you can have for over a year and resale it for almost what you paid for it. I just sold my BDP-93 for $449 and my BDP-83 I had for more than 2 years before that for $429 (Both retailed for $499). I was able to sell my BDP-93 and an Emotiva XDA-1 and only pay a little more than $500 to up grade to this player. WOW! Now comes the BDP-105, I'm not going to get into how fantastic it sounds with BD's, DVD's, CD's and as a DAC, every one else has had there say on that and I can't say anymore than that as I agree with everything. I will say that the picture from my Directv HD-24 is so much better run through the 105's HDMI back input instead of directly to my Panasonic Plasma HDTV that it's scary. Not only is the picture better, but the clarity in sound is far better also in my system, instead of having the audio hooked up through the optical digital to my Pre-Pro. I had the OPPO BDP-105 hooked up directly to my power amps but didn't seem have enough volume, at least for me anyways, so I ended up hooking it up to the multi-channel input on my Integra DCT 9.8. Now I have volume galore! I run the Integra as a volume boost only with all processing, including Audyssey, turned off, and did the speaker calibration's with the OPPO along with bass management. I must say that with the high hopes I had for this unit they were excided well beyond my expectations. Super highly recommended! And now with DSD decoding through the USB, makes it more of a no- brainer!

$review_text.: Installed easily for me, worked flawlessly out of the box, defaulted to the wrong MHZ, had to set 1600 manually, but otherwise no set upWARNING - as it can be annoying to ruin your setup, this ram is tall, look into that, especially if you're running a tall air cooling heatsink, this is NOT a fault of the product, however, and I still give it 5-stars accordinglyOther than that what else can you say, its Corsair, which means it's great, the only real thing you can hope for out of your RAM is it runs well for a long time, I can confirm A, only owned 3 months at this time

$review_text.: I've seen some reviews where users are having some difficulty setting the controllers on properly, however I have not had any issues with this at all.  It only took my 5 year old son 2 tries until he mastered it, so it is certainly family friendly.You do need to make sure that you have a place where the controllers are not going to be knocked out, as they are not locked in extremely snug, and the cord isn't exceedingly long, however they certainly fit in snug enough.  With the glowing red and green indicators, and the angle at which they are placed, it makes for a nice looking design that induces my family members to actually put the controllers away when they are finished rather than just leaving them around various parts of the living room (plus they keep them charged!)  Overall very pleased with my purchase.
$review_summary.: Great holder for my controllers!

$review_text.: Bought this item last December as a gift to my daughter. At a price of $59 then, it was a real bargain. However, last week I accidentally hit a door knob while the camera was strung in my hand and the LCD display hit the metal knob. It was a slight bump but when I turned the camera on the LCD dispay would not turn on. Also there was what look like liquid inside the lower right portion of the display and that's when I realized the display itself might be damaged. I can still take pictures but without a working display I could not compose a scene, look at the finish photos, or change settings. There is no alternative viewfinder so the camera is practically useless. So folks, be very careful not to hit the LCD display on any hard object.

$REVIEW.: I've recently switched from a dedicated hiking GPS to just using my iPhone &amp; gaiagps. This battery allows me to do multi-day treks without running out of power. It weighs less than my GPS - and since I bring my phone along anyways, I actually reduce packing weight!

$review_text.: I had been using a 2.4Ghz sender for the past two years and I had lots of problems with interference. This product is fantastic, image is clear with no interference problems, WI-Fi and Microwave is not a problem anymore.I give it only 4 stars because the range of the IR receiver seem to be shorter or less strong than my previous sender, so from time to time changing channels is a problem, however the image and sound quality of the transmission makes it up for that minor problem.

$REVIEW.: First off, unless you have the noise cancelling mode on, the sound is absolutely horrible--VERY tinny/puny sound as someone else noted.  This is a big showstoper for me since I don't always need the NC on.Secondly, these headphones will cause you pain after just a couple of hours, probably because the pading is flush with the middle part of the headphone.  Ouch, they really do hurt.Lastly, and this probably is a problem with other noise cancelling phones, your blackberry will drive these phones absolutley crazy--nonstop buzzing.  Anyone that has a blackberry and has had their phone too close to cheap speakers will know exactly what I'm talking about.  Beware of this problem.  Since you really have to have NC on all the time for these headphones to sound decent, the buzzing may drive you bonkers.Oh well, at least they're inexpensive.

I was very impressed with the sound quality the first time I tried it out as soon as I got it. Then I realized that it 'pops' open in order to provide even better sound and bass! For such a small, battery powered speaker, the sound quality is really good. Plus, the small size makes it very convenient to take with you practically anywhere.It is very convenient that it has an audio cord built in, so you can use this to play music from anyone's device. Only thing I would recommend is having a longer audio cord to use when possible, as the included cable is short. But that isn't necessary.The possible uses for this mini speaker are endless, but to name just one, I have used it in the car to play audio from my phone (music, podcasts, videos, etc.) because I do not have Bluetooth connections or an auxiliary jack in my car. This speaker lets everyone in my car be able to hear the sounds!

$REVIEW.: I really like this router. It's easy to set up and get working. It also has a ton of options that let you control everything you would ever need to. You can have both a wireless G network for your older devices as well as a wireless N network for your newer faster devices. Both at the same time! When I switched to this router I noticed right away that web pages came up faster on my wired computers. Both the wireless G and N worked fine in our house.For wireless N connectivity on our notebook we use theRangeMax WNDA3100 Dual Band Wireless-N Adapter. For greater coverage we also addedNETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111). The notebook gets great speeds a floor away from the access point. I am very happy with the performance of all the router features.Cool Features:- The Web interface is easy to use covers everything I need to do.- Allows the router to email you the logs on a user specified schedule.- Firmware is easy to update and the router will check if there is an update available.- It is easy to find the grid of attached devices along with all the stats for each connected device.- IP reservation is easy since it allows you to pick the device from the list. No more typing in MAC addresses.- Security for wireless also allows you to just pick the device from the list of attached devices and add it to the allowed devices. On other routers you have to type in MAC addresses.Items to note:- It is not a 1 gigabit router. But you can easily plug it into a 1 gig switch and then plug all your 1 gig devices into that switch.- The large blue light on the top cannot be shut off. It will light up a fairly large area in the dark. It's cool looking though.

For day to day ordinary use, 4GB of storage at this price is a pretty good deal.  I'm quite happy with it.

While they almost all said that it was hard to figure out, the ONLY trouble I had was fitting the rubber eye piece inside the eye piece frame. (it's a bit like putting a bike tire on a rim..you have to work your way around while holding it in place)The white material is  soft, flexible, and LOOKS like it will repel water (I have not tried it out yet). After the above assembly, the eye piece is an open hole, allowing you to see your subject clearly. (no looking through vinyl material like some others) The only vinyl material is around the eye piece, which allows you to see the various buttons, top of camera, and LCD view finder on your body.There is PLENTY of space for just about any type of tripod head (I use a ballhead). In fact, the only problem I can see is if you use your camera "off tripod", where the extra material might get in your way. Still. There is enough Velcro pieces on this where I'm sure you can tuck it all in and secure it just fine, while still leaving room for your hands. I would not use this off tripod because I would worry about rain running down the camera straps. But that's me.There are instructions included, but I didn't even see them (still in the handy carry bag) until I was re-packing the rain cover (shows you how easy it was to figure out). I might not have had the set up exactly like they said, but I can see there are several ways you can make this work depending on your set up (again, plenty of Velcro).They supply a total of three rubber eye pieces (in case you drop one). Not just the small rubber piece that you insert, but these are actual eye pieces that slide down over your body's viewer (you have to remove your makers eye piece to use it, so put it in your pocket or some place safe while you use the other)While I bought the SMALL size, It measured 17 inches from the back of the camera to the end of the tube your lens goes in. I also tried it with a couple other lenses, a shorter prime lens (35mm), and an 11-16mm zoom. The fit is fine so long as you tuck in the extra material before you Velcro everything down. Just use a bit of fore thought when tucking extra material in so you dont channel water back INTO your camera.I've posted some photos that I took of the set up, to show the various parts of this cover. (I had to use my point &amp; shoot, so please excuse the quality)One piece of advice....put everything together at home a time or two before trying it in the field. When in the field, put it together in the car BEFORE going out in the rain. Just makes sence to me.There is no doubt that I would advise a friend to buy this, as I will do just that (every shooter I know lives in Oregon and Oregon is WET!)One reviewer said this is the same rain cover that has the 'Canon" logo on it. If this is the case, I can see no reason to pay the extra money for the logo only.

I also have an old Radio Shack set of unamplified rabbit ears which I've never found anything better for DTV


This Phillips amplified antenna gives me about equal performance to the obsolete Radio Shack one
I live about 15 miles from the broadcast towers
We get 6 digital channels here so far


I kind of have to tune the antenna so I get a 7 bar signal strength for each channel

I can peak the signal at 10 bars on most channels, but the other channels may become unwatchable.The main secret is don't use the supplied RG-59 coax lead

Go to your electronics store and purchase a larger RG-6 coax lead


This will improve your signal strength, and in my case made the difference between receiving our highest channel (18 PBS) or not receiving it.

"You need this" the big box salesman would say and then hand you a $30 or $40 package with a 3 or 6 foot HDMI cable - usually of dubious quality.  Many still do this, and some of the bigger high-discount box stores still have amazingly high prices on "accessories" for any audio or video equipment.Savvy consumers quickly learned that they could get a perfectly good HDMI cable for single digits, and an online cable business in the Los Angeles area has made a big business about selling excellent quality cables for small markups.Meanwhile, Amazon has also been a great source for third party companies selling good cables at steep discounts.  At the same time, Amazon has become involved in providing video content, so it makes sense for them to also provide their own products for watching those videos (assuming that your 7" Kindle Fire screen is too small, lol).Just looking at these cables shows that Amazon is quite serious about the video business.  The smooth black plastic with the Amazon name/logo is covered with cellophane to keep it looking good for when you are ready to install the cable.  The plugs are relatively slim, so that they fit in situations where there are plugs above and below the HDMI jack.The Amazon Basics name on the cable itself, shows that even the raw cable supplier is making significant quantities specifically made for this product.Unfotunately, I cannot yet test the ethernet or other advanced capabilities of the cable, but it is certainly nice to know that it won't be necessary to buy a new cable later if I do upgrade.The cable clearly has tough and solid construction, without being overly thick and awkward to work with.I did try replacing the HDMI cable to my main living room 1080p screen with this cable and could not detect any difference.  Since the 3 year old cable was a top premium HDMI cable of its day, that is a very good recommendation for this product.Of course, the biggest selling point is the very inexpensive selling price of this cable.  Since it qualifies for Amazon's usual free shipping when included with other items to make up the minimum, it's hard to find any other HDMI cable of equal quality at this price.

Stick fairly well.Cons:  Could be "grippier".  While they stay closed when wrapped evenly around an item (the pressure to unwrap cannot overcome the grip), they do not stay closed well if there is force applied in other directions.  In other words, if the item being wrapped is unwieldy, they tend to come loose.  But no worries, just use more ties!!

The picture isn't the best I've ever seen, but it's quite watchable. It's clear and bright. The volume was set at maximum when I got it, so beware when you turn it on the first time. The up side of that is that I could hear everything clearly in spite of a slight hearing loss. It's not full, rich sound-- this is enough to get you through a movie and know what's going on. It's not going to blow you away with realistic sound, but you can plug in some headphones if you want fuller sound. I like that you can play movies while the lid is closed. I can listen to my favorite shows at the office kind of like radio. It feels solid, looks sleek and is easy to carry.It was easy to just take it out of the box and start playing. You'll probably be familiar with most of the commands, but if you want to get full flexibility, you'll need to look at the manual. I don't like to rely on a battery, and I don't watch stuff while I'm driving, but I think most people do. I think this should have included an adapter for the car, because the battery lasts less than two hours-- and a lot of movies are longer than that. Travelling with this thing would be a bummer if you ran out of juice right before the end of every movie. The other drawback is that I have to push buttons on the remote at least twice to get it to work. It's not responsive as it could be, and that can be irritating.Overall this is a good, solid player for home use, and good for a kid's room or in an office. I just think the remote needs to be more responsive and that a car adapter would make it a five star product.

$REVIEW.: I wanted this audio player to listen to library audio books. For that it worked for about a week and then it was dead. It would not power on even after charging. Other reviewers have said the same so I should have listened. Also the maximum volume was barely high enough when piping the sound into my car radio, but ok for ear bud use. Luckily my Pocket PC, a Dell Axim, worked to play the DRM files, plus its touch screen makes navigation easy. I still would like a small player like the Zen, since the Axim is a bit bulky.

I bought this on impulse when I saw it at a Sam's Club for $39 because it would provide wireless network connectivity to one of our TVs that didn't have any network connectivity to it.  It worked just great right our of the box.  We have since replaced that TV with a projector and, even though the blu-ray player will complete the same tasks as this media player, I kept it because it indexes music and videos on our home NAS a lot faster and easier than the Panasonic DMP-BDT310 3D Blu-ray disc player.

$review_text.: This adapter is very well made and works well in using Canon EF and EF-S lenses on an EOS-M
Based on the recommendations of others, I paid the higher price for the Canon adapter rather than buying the third-party brand
The tripod mount on the bottom of the adapter is very useful in balancing the camera and the lens and is perfect for use with the Opteka HG-1 Heavy Duty Aluminum Grip which gives you solid, stable control of the camera and lens
I am very happy with this purchase and encourage Amazon and Canon to bring us the new Canon EOS-M2 so I can buy another camera and Canon mount adapter.

$REVIEW.: The USB cable that came with my printer was not nearly long enough so I purchased this. This USB cable has four things going for it: it's made by Belkin (all of the Belkin products I've purchased to date have been of excellent quality), it's 10 feet long, the whole thing is less than $4, and it's Amazon Prime (2-day shipping). `Nuf said.
$review_summary.: High quality

Low price.

$review_text.: Works on my Sony SLT-A57

Half pressing works just as the half press on the camera

Remote is small and portable


My only gripe is that the cable plug/socket fits but not as i would like


When connected it doesnt feel like it is securely in, but it is i guess.

Not only did I come out $5.00 more for priority mail to send the memory in for warranty service (tracking number etc) the replacement is worse than the one i gave them! Where i used to get 1 minute 30 seconds video recording at class 4, the camcorder now fails to record for 30 seconds.Class 6 people! Is the maximum my camcorder CAN record...max
This memory is advertised as "class 10" and cannot do 30 seconds at a much lower datarate, pathetic.I will not spend any more money to return this in for warranty


This memory card is downgraded for use in my 10 year old's camera.UPDATE: 3/29/2011Sometime after the original review I lost the memory card (after all it *was* worthless in its current condition), so when Patriot offered to make good on a bad product, I was unable to go through the process
Well, I just found the card this week, as always, when I was not actually looking for it.26Mar2011, per Patriot Memory's request I submitted a support ticket.28Mar2011, I received a reply," I am sorry to hear the issues you are having

We had some issues withour class 10 SDHC cards not functioning correctly and since thenresolved it with a new firmware
We will need to have you send your cardin to be replaced

Also your model camcorder has been tested and we haveverified to work with class 10."29Mar2011, I got around to submitting the RMA


According to the ticket, I should hear back within 48 hours and can expect return instructions.UPDATE: 3/26/2011Since Patriot Memory's comment to submit a support ticket I revisited my original testing and added the following memory chips:-- Kodak SD Memory card (2GB), Class Unknown-- PNY Optima Class 4 SDHCI recorded video within my attention span, averaged three timed events it took save a picture, and averaged three timed events it took for a recording to stop.PNY recorded 8 minutes of error free video, Super Fineaverage picture save time, 6 secondsaverage record stopping time, 6 secondsKodak recorded 4 minutes of error free video, super fineave picture save time, .9 secondsaverage record "stopping" time, 1 secondPatriot record errors, super fineaverage picture save time, 10 secondsaverage record stopping time, 9 secondsORIGINAL REVIEW: November 2010I bought this memory card to use with a newly purchased Samsung F40 camcorder -this memory chip cannot record more than 1 minute 30 seconds in "T.V


Super Fine" or 2 minutes with the camcorder set to "TV Fine"


BOTH eventually give error "Low Speed Card
Please record a lower Resolution"
I have yet to record enough video to error out at "TV Norma"l setting.1) A "Class 10" chip should handle 10MB/s transfer


For those of you unaware, the number following "Class" is the data transfer speed, so Class 2 is 2MB/s, Class 4 is 4MB/s and so on and so forth.2) My camcorder is SD!! Not 720p or 1080p, it is straight up VHS quality "digital" video with a STANDARD TV resolution of 720x480 thus the camcorder ONLY requires the memory to be capable of:TV Super Fine (about 5.0Mbps)TV Fine (about 4.0Mbps)TV Normal (about 3.0Mbps)This memory card is obviously NOT a Class 10 device ---it isn't even Class 4! This cheap plastic material barely pushes past Class 2

I'm very happy with it.  My only concern (and the reason for the 4 stars vs. 5) is that,while docked, I've noticed the battery status lights alternately blinking amber light with steady blue light which means &amp;#34;Temporary battery failure with AC adapter present&amp;#34;.  I don't understand what this means and it stops after some time. I've notice it two or three times.  So, the 4 stars is only based on my cautionary nature regarding the status light.  This may be perfectly normal... perhaps somethng to do with the docking station power supply which is a higher voltage than the regular power suppy.  But to be clear, the battery has been as I would expect from a new Dell battery.

if your into gaming at 1080p this monitor isnt for you, even with that said it is a great looking monitor its just really annoying because the xbox does not have an aspect ration for this so every time you'll get a notification telling you to switch it to 16:9

The router is stored 3 floors below 2 of our wireless users. One user is plugged into the router directly.The direct connection is fabulous. There are occasional hiccups, but these could be the DSL service. It's hard to tell.The wireless users usually have strong connections. But when they used the WPN111 adapters, they had lousy connections. For several minutes at a time, there would be no connection. The connection was always sporadic. Switching to an internal PCI card improved the connection tremendously, underscoring the fact that the problem was with the adapter and not the router.The blue light is an annoyance, but newer models have a button on the back for turning off the LED light.I recommend the router with one reservation. If you must use a USB adapter, don't buy this model. It works only with the WPN111, which Netgear should have killed before it ever came to market.

$REVIEW.: First off, you will lose some sharpness and contrast with this teleconverter
Second off, you will lose some sharpness and contrast with every teleconverter so you should be aware of this before buying one

Third off, you will not lose as much sharpness and contrast with this teleconverter as you will with previous iterations or with generic third party converters
If you need a 2x teleconverter for compatible Nikon lenses, this is the way to go.I mostly use this with a 70-200mm f/4 as I don't particularly need a faster 400mm nor do I feel like paying for one (let's not even mention how heavy a 400mm prime can be)
In this particular case, it's superb and requires just a touch of sharpening and contrast adjustment in Photoshop or Lightroom
Focusing isn't super fast on a D600, but it's adequate
If I was going for better performance here then I would have bought a more substantial 400mm
I've also used it with a 300mm f/2.8 and I can get away without additional sharpening in post, but just because I can get away with it doesn't mean that I will


Focus speed is also pretty excellent with the 300mm (effectively a 600mm f/5.6)

Overall, I'm pleased


It does precisely what I want it to, nothing more and nothing less.

$review_text.: My first experience with this adapter was favorable. I was able to download the updated drivers and install it properly on my MacBook Pro. The speed was noticeably faster than the wifi I had previously been using at work and everything looked good.Unfortunately, I cannot give this adapter the five stars that I was initially inclined to give. I have to regularly remove the adapter from my laptop to go to meetings and every now and then, at random, removing the adapter causes the operating system to crash. This happens on average once a day. Until an updated driver solves that problem, the most I can give it is two stars.

If you are an over-the-top audiophile and/or money is no object, you may want to look elsewhere, but the vast majority of people will be perfectly satisfied with this speaker. Remember, a center speaker's main use is for dialogue in 5.1, so it is the reproduction of midrange frequencies -- particularly 1500-3000 Hz -- that is important. And the TL1 does this job quite well.I have mine paired (singled?) with a pair ofInfinity Primus P153 bookshelf speakers(I would have gotten the P163s, but Amazon had the P153s for 60% off, a deal I couldn't resist), aPolk Audio 10-Inch subwoofer, and a pair of older Yamaha surrounds that were mounted in the ceiling years ago. The Polk TL1 plays well with these and, leaving aside the surrounds, the whole set up ran not much more than 260 clams. Can't beat that with a stick.To top it off, the TL1 has a very low profile, which may be important to many people because a center speaker is always sitting just below (or hanging just above) the screen. It is somewhat reminiscent in its profile of those MP3 or Bluetooth speaker units that Logitech sells, albeit slightly bulkier. If you're the kind of person who really wants to draw attention to the fact you have a center speaker and a 5.1 setup (you know who you are -- you always remove the grills on all of your speakers, too!), this probably isn't for you.

$REVIEW.: When I received it, I was extremely happy with the art work.  As I proceeded to put this against the laptops I had it does not fit any wide screens that is larger than 14 1/2".  It should not state "Fits 13" wide to 16.5" wide screen size laptop".  If you measure your laptop screen diagonal ten it might fit because it is approximately 18" that way. The height is 11", width is  it is 14 1/2", diagonal is 18". I tried to put it on my older laptop but it was out of alignment a little bit so I tried to peel it off - mistake!  It peeled the black paint off. Also,they stated that it included 2 wrist pad with each laptop skin sticker. They are not actually wrist pads but two stickers only that I assume is suppose to go on the wrist pads.I'll wait to rate the seller to see what their resolution is because when I contacted them, they told me to buy a bigger one for my 15" Dell.

So I decided to take this card for a spin and wow am I amazed at how this card sped up most of my games. I just popped this guy right into my system and there I was enjoying better graphics so yes I do recommend this card for anyone who needs to upgrade from an older card but does not want to spend a lot.***Update 6/15/12***: This card still rocks! it has delivered great performance and plays tons of games. My system currently: Intel core 2 duo e7500(2.93 ghz), 6GB Ram, and this card. Overall I have seen many improvements in my systems speed plus more and more games i can finally play now!. Also, UPDATE to the latest drivers which now are at 301.42. With the current drivers I have seen a performance increase in gaming and with Nvidia's new technology fxaa, this card has brang all the games i play to their knees. Overall, still a very worthwhile purchase.***Update 1/4/2014***: This Card is still working! though now it is old and the Drivers are not the best for it, I would have to say 314.22 has been the most rock solid for this card. I have since though past the computer containing this card onto my brother so this will be my last update but my bro says he loves it over his old HP that had a 6 series card.

Why replace the Nav-Mat you ask? You have to use the wind shield suction cup attachment to attach your GPS to the Nav-Mat, like all suction cups, they come loose, at the worst possible times

It's very annoying and dangerous to have to resuction it while you are driving

This Garmin mount solves that problem, the mounting stem doesn't rely on a suction for its attachment.DECEMBER 2012 UPDATE: I now own a smartphone which functions as a GPS so I'm no longer using my Garmin GPS as much
I purchased this new car mount for my phone:Arkon SM410 Universal Windshield with Dashboard and Vent Mount for Smartphones and PDAsYou can attach it to the vent or use the suction cup
I wanted my phone at eye level with the road so the vent mount option was out and you already know how I hate suction cups
Much to my surprise, their mount uses a ball and socket which matches that of the Garmin Mount so I was able to take off the phone holder from the Akron mount and attach it to stem of this Garmin mount
It fits perfectly! So for those of you looking to continue to use your smartphone with this mount, I highly recommend picking up that Akron mount.

$review_text.: I have had different brands of CD burners over many years and found the Sony brand to be one that provides consistent quality and performance

This has been my third Sony CD/DVD burner


In the past I've also owned Memorex (good) and Lite-On (they actually provide a technology many brands utilize)


I have this installed on a six year old self-built Pentium-4 system running at 2.66ghz and it runs fine
I would expect that older and less able processor systems would be suspect of newer drives based on the processor and resource demands (such as Pentium 3 processor systems)


One should take this in consideration regardless of brands when updating any component of older systems

I have no hesitation or reservations with the Sony brand for most electronic components in general though.

I wouldn't want it as my primary listening system at home, but it put the speakers in my laptop and iPod to shame, and worked exactly as advertised for a great low price.Obviously you're not going to get deep, rich bass out of this little thing, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it filled in the lower notes and kick drums

The volume wasn't enough to fill a room, but for a couple of people sitting around a table chatting and playing cards, it's adequate.It was plug-and-play in Windows XP for me; my laptop detected the speakers as a generic USB audio device and I didn't experience any of the problems the other reviewer mentioned with bursts of white noise.We used it on-and-off for three days, maybe 4-6 hours a day, and the batteries still had power when we left

Very happy with this purchase overall.

I would prefer them to be UP, beacuse it is better for wires and also I could look at the screen without having to unclip it from my belt or twisting my head.But there's no way to adjust.Ipod slides freely from the case when I try to plug it to charger, there's no fixation.

$REVIEW.: Last year, I purchased the Hoodman Eyecup for my Canon T3i.  I know many photographers who use Hoodman and it's a reputable name brand but it also cost $20.  I've know of cheaper versions online but when I started seeing reviews on Amazon for this GOJA version (Note This is a JJC Eyecup using TPU rubber and this version is an EC-7/18mm Eye Cup for Canon), I had to check out for myself.And I hope this review helps those who are trying to decide whether or not to go for this version or the Hoodman version.  The Hoodman version is slightly thicker (for the rubber and the connection plate) and the connecting plate has a ridge lock right underneath.  The GOJA version doesn't.  But the biggest influence for many will be the price.  GOJA is much cheaper at $7.99.  Hoodman is $20.Now here is the reason why I prefer the GOJA/JJC version.1.  PRICE2.  While the extra ridge lock on the Hoodman is nice, for anyone who owns a Canon T3i will probably want to flip the LCD viewer out, like most eyecups for the T3i, you're going to have to take off the eyecup, flip open the LCD and put it back in.  Hoodman's are great if you own a camera with a stationary LCD screen on your DSLR.  Because T3i owners who use the eyecup need to take it on and off, chances of losing it are great and thus, having to repurchase a $20 eyecup may be pricey to some.  Otherwise, if you lose a $7.99 eyecup, you won't feel as bad.3.  Comfort - The rubber is comfortable and like the Hoodman's, you can easily rotate it if you want to use your left eye or right eye.JUDGMENT CALL:The Hoodman eyecups are great (granted you may want to do your research first before buying as you may buy the wrong version as many have done) but they are much more expensive.  Eyecups tend to get lost if you tend to remove them often and for Canon T3i owners, you are going to have to remove it often if you plan to extend your LCD viewer.With that being said, for a low price alternative that fits perfectly on a Canon T3i, snug and not loose when connected, easily rotatable and comfortable on the eyes and of course...THE MUCH LOWER PRICE...the GOJA/JJC eyecup works perfectly and just as good as my Hoodman!  Oh, and you also get a free microfiber lens cleaning cloth as well!Definitely recommended for Canon T3i owners! (and other cameras listed in the product description)

$REVIEW.: I received a Soundfreq Sound Spot speaker to review and these are my independent options.  First off, I love Technology and these speakers are great.  I have used Soundfreaq speakers in the past, and have purchased several wireless speaker from them in the past.  I have always been happy with their products, and am happy with the small, and stylish Sound Spot Speakers as well.  The sound is great!  Crisp, clear, and perfect for just about any style of music.  Between my husband and myself we have listed to heavy metal, hip-hop, rock, and country and everything sounded great.  The bass is fair when you listen to hip hop, it&amp;#8217;s not super loud, but for the size of the speaker I think Soundfreaq perfected the speaker as far as sound.  It&amp;#8217;s easy to connect your phone and enjoy music.  The speaker is light, and the charge lasts a long time.  I cannot tell you how long from start to finish, but my husband listened to the speaker for longer than 4 hours without needing to charge it.Everything is easy to access, the functions work well, and I&amp;#8217;m really happy with it.  I have tried other wireless speaker in the past, and have been disappointed.  I liked this speaker so much I have purchased an additional one as a gift for my mom, and my teen daughter.  Oh, another added perk is that you can charge your cell phone even when the speaker is running on its own battery.  I love that feature, and I&amp;#8217;m sure my teen will put it to use when she receives her speaker.  These really are a nice speaker, and if you&amp;#8217;re looking for a great gift for someone I think they will be happy with the Sound Spot speaker.ProsSound &amp;#8211; It&amp;#8217;s little, but don&amp;#8217;t be fooled.  This speaker can rock.BatteryAppearanceEasy to useLightweight, and easy to move from room to room.Fits nicely anywhereI love the white and wood lookReady to use out of the boxValueConsI honestly cannot think of anything.  I even asked my husband if he could think of anything that he didn&amp;#8217;t like about the speaker, and he agreed they are a great product.

$REVIEW.: I like using my iPad2 without an case/cover attached, so this sort of simple zip-up case is ideal for storing it while not in use, or protecting it when I'm out and about.It seems well built and well thought-out:There is a slightly fuzzy, very soft, white interior material, which seems to be very gentle on the screen. It did leave some little fuzzies on the screen at first, but that seems to be tapering down. The iPad2 fits well inside, though there is a little more wiggle room then there needs to be. (I'm guessing this is so an iPad2 with a smart cover will fit inside.) The exterior is a semi-stiff neoprene-like material, which seems to provide a lot of protection because of the sort of "corrugated" style. I have the red one, and it looks very nice. The zippers seem nice, too. Just FYI, the zipper only goes from the upper corner to near the opposite corner, which works fine.Small complaints:1. I wish there was more padding around the interior edges of the case. I have a Belkin case for Kindle that has two extra "lips" of padding all the way around the inner edges, which sort of overlap, even under the zipper. This helps with edge drops. On the iLuv, there is some of this edge padding, but it's not even close to overlapping, so the thin edges of the iPad2 can slip right between the two lips in the event of a drop, so edge drops could be more damaging.2. I wish there was some sort of small, unobtrusive accessory pocket. Even just a little "sleeve" on the outside/inside/back, where I could slip just the power cord. As it is, there's nowhere to put anything extra.Overall though, this seems to be a nice, attractive case for the price.

I can't tell you how many reviews I've read raving about a product and then you find out that they just received it. How do you review something you barely used or in some cases haven't used at all? Please people use the product and then review, or at least update your review after you have used it for a few months.Sorry. Had to say that. So the review. I have used the YN622 for about 6 months now. I originally bought 2 and after some weekend sessions (I never use untested equipment on professional gigs) I bought two more. I now have 4 total giving me 3 off camera flashes and potential a fourth on the camera. I have used these quite a bit and they have be very solid. I have had a few glitches where they wouldn't work so I switched the transceiver on my camera with the one I was using with the flash and the problem seemed to fix itself. I may have not had it completely tightened down. There have been some other small glitches, but being in the heat of the moment and trying to get a shot, sometimes I don't slow down and think about how everything is set up.These work great with the ETTL and being able to set the flash manually from the camera is pretty awesome as well as using the ETTL feature. I only shoot manually so I haven't truly tested the ETTL function, but the times I have used it it has worked flawlessly and as expected. I bought these over the other options because of the ETTL in the event that I would like to use it, but the added bonus of being able to set the flash manually from the camera is pretty awesome. I only have one ETTL flash (430EX II) and that is the only one that I can set from the camera. The others are just manual flashes and they have to be set from the flash.My one complaint is that it is really easy to hit the buttons when moving the flashes around. You can change the channel or group by accident really easily. Also the light communication method is a little confusing. One more minor nitpick is that it is really hard sometimes to unlighted the transceiver from the camera or stand. It is just hard to get my fat hands between the camera and transceiver to get a grip on the locking wheel.I would definitely recommend these especially if you have ETTL flashes and want to use that function. They have been reliable for probably around 2-4 thousand shots so far, maybe more.

$review_text.: Skip it.I bought a Garmin, a mio 310, and a TOMTOM 720.Try this. Map out IKEA or Department of Motor Vehicles.Only the Garmin or Mio have them listed.I bought a nokia because I thought the POI database was updated. They are not. There is no way to update the POI database. I'm going back to Garmin. Mio has such a bad algorythm. and TOMTOM has the same issue with the POI database.  I have an old Alpine navigation unit in my car and it still has more poi locations then ANY of these 3 units I have purchased. Too bad the new gps they have had such bad reviews.The Nokia doesn't even have a qwerty keyboard. They bought Navteq and they didn't even get all the poi's? Thats bad.

The best part is that it also has a little &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; built into it - small legs that give some minor cant to the laptop. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I'd needed that.

$REVIEW.: I've dealt with pain in my wrist for years. Using this mouse places my hand in the correct position and I feel instant relief from a constant throbbing pain that shoots through my wrist and causes tingling in my fingers.I use the extra buttons to quickly close or minimize windows, and to go forward and backward in web browsers. I add up the seconds this saves me throughout a day and I'm very grateful. Plus it decreases aggravation when I don't have to hunt for the Red X.Everyone comments about the mouse looking futuristic. Takes a few minutes to get used to, so in that sense it keeps people off my computer. But I find the ergonomics brilliant.I ordered my first mouse on February 25, 2011 and it suddenly died last week in August 2013. It was off when I got to work so I replugged it into the USB slot. It works for about 20 seconds then the lights flickered and it shutoff. I tried two different computers and contacted Evoluent technical support. They couldn't offer a resolution, it seemed the circuitry just gave up. I went a few days with a regular mouse but now I'm happy to have my Evoluent VM4R back in my hand.

$review_text.: EDIT 120816:  WARNING WARNING WARNING - Windows 8 Release to Manufacturers (RTM) Enterprise drivers do not work for the Acer Iconia.  You do not get the option to select a second touch screen.  (Actually, this seems likely to be a bug in Windows 8 to me.  Surely many people will have multiple touch screens attached?)  You cannot flip the orientation of either tablet individually. If you say extend the desktop, it mysteriously changes back to duplicated on its own when you exit the configuration screen.  Why did microsoft do this?  The drivers were working fine in the Customer Preview except that it said you wouldn't get the full pleasure of windows 8.  now i don't get any pleasure at all.Since I bought this dual touch tablet for Windows 8 testing and ultimately its use, I have a really expensive paperweight now.  Please Acer, provide drivers for the dual touch tablets in w8 asap!  You should also provide your keyboard and windows utilities that you did for windows 7.  Please rush now that the RTM is out.***************original review follows**************Windows 8 Customer Preview (free from Microsoft) finally gave me the excuse I was hunting for to justify buying this toy.  I saw some videos of the two working together on youtube (thanks to gameveda for posting them), and also some tips on how to easily get both touchscreens working as input devices.It is indeed working fairly well--far better than you would expect a so-called "beta" version to work, that is.  It has hung up a couple of times, though, so I'd recommend doing dual boot until the final Windows 8 comes out if you depend upon the Iconia as your primary machine.To be extra safe for the installation, you can use the built-in "eRecovery" utilities to create recovery DVD's (takes an external USB DVD-writer and 5 blank single density DVDs).  You can also order the media ready-made from Acer.  I also created the utilities and applications DVD.  That's a good thing because I plan on trying to install some of the Acer software in Windows 8!Microsoft could learn a little about handling multiple touch monitors from Acer.  For example, there is no way (that I've discovered) to use touch in Windows 8 to get windows from one screen to the other when they're stacked vertically like this.  Acer software adds two buttons on the upper right of every window, one of which, when you touch it, puts finger-friendly size buttons on the corners for resizing. The other button snaps the window to the other screen.  This button is also very convenient when using the mouse.[update 3/21/2012:  I've found that if I turn ON auto-hide [default is off] for the task bar, I can slide a window between monitors that are vertically stacked.  Just enough of the upper border shows on the other monitor to complete the movement if I'm careful with finger placement.  Better would be the Acer type buttons or a flick command when moving towards this edge.]Installation was easy, except that for some bizarre reason (like I said, Microsoft could take some lessons from Acer on multiple touch screen usage), the way that you identify touchscreens in Windows 8 requires you to press the ENTER KEY ON A KEYBOARD!?!?!?!  You touch the screen to show that it's a touch screen, but then the only way to move on to the next screen is to press enter!  Anyway, have a keyboard handy when setting up. :-)There seems to be some question about it in various reviews, but mine came with an external USB card reader.  Swapping out the memory forCorsair 8GB (2x 4GB) 1333mhz PC3-10666 204-pin DDR3 SODIMM Laptop Memory Kit CMSO8GX3M2A1333C9takes no tools.  It's probably not really necessary for most day to day usage, but memory is a real bargain right now and you never know what kind of applications you might want to try on this thing eventually!  My iconia did not come with bluetooth.CONS:  weight and battery life.Hmmm.  How will I justify getting the newer version with the "ultrabook" i7 ivy bridge chips?  Hmmm.  Maybe to run the final version of Windows 8 when it comes out? Hmmm.Edit 6/5/2012:  Installed W8 Release Preview.  Sliding in from the sides to get the "charms" or the thumbnails of open apps works much more easily now.  M/S fixed the first of the two requirements for the external keyboard during setup.  Now the second touch screen asks if it's a touch screen automatically after you touch the first.  However, you still need the kb to press enter on the second touchscreen to exit that configuration.  I never did get most of the Acer add-on running but didn't complain since they weren't really written for W8.  ACER, WE ARE READY FOR THESE NOW!  Particularly need the ability to move a window vertically between screens with your fingers rather than the mouse!

Granted, it is well-made and very comfortable if you like to hang your camera around your neck. However, when you mount your camera on a tripod, the strap becomes a nuisance. First of all, I find my self flipping it constantly to free it from the view of the lens or sensors in front of the camera. Secondly, if you are in the wind, the wide pad on the strap can catch the wind and shake the tripod assembly. I found myself wanting to remove the strap, or tuck it somewhere so the wind wouldn't catch it. I also don't like the strap ends hanging about. I've tried to adjust the length, but the loose ends still bother me. I have ordered another strap that is designed as a harness and lets the camera hang from the hip (Black Color Carry Speed Cs-1 MK II Sling Strap Rapid for Dslr). It also enables you to remove the camera from the strap if you want. We'll see if that solves some of the issues I've had with the Crumpler.

Buggy firmware in the early-going, gave a lot of SSD manufacturers, big-time PR headaches. The good news is, SandForce seems to have finally remedied the bugs that reacquainted a lot of Windows users with the blue screen of death (BSOD).PROS:- Comprehensive upgrade kit- Gorgeous drive- Great performance- Great website support- Backed by a 3-year warrantyCONS:- Firmware can only be updated in WindowsThe Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit is a SandForce-based SSD, that performs similarly to other SandForce SSDs--wicked fast. What is different about the HyperX SSD, is the sharp, visual aesthetics and the killer bundle in the upgrade kit.UNBOXINGThere's no question that Kingston paid special attention to the packaging. Unlike many SSDs, the HyperX SSD comes in a high-quality box with foam inserts that protect the contents. The packaging is so nice, that you might want to actually keep it as a storage box for spare 2.5-inch drives.Upon opening the lid of the box, you see the beautiful blue HyperX SSD drive in a foam insert. In the underside of the foam insert, is the desktop adapter plate. Beneath that, you'll find another foam insert with the external enclosure and screwdriver. Also included is a USB cable for the external drive enclosure, blue SATA III cable, mounting screws and a software CD that includes a bootable-only version of Acronis True Image cloning software.UPGRADE KIT* Desktop adapter plateThe blue 2.5-inch to 3.5-inch adapter plate is a nice-to-have, if you ever plan on using the HyperX SSD with a desktop computer. Many newer ATX computer enclosures, like the Corsair 600T, now include drive trays that support 2.5-inch drives, but in just case your enclosure doesn't, having the adapter is a nice convenience. Buying an adapter on your own would run you about $10, but it wouldn't match your HyperX SSD with the cool blue color or have the logo.* ScrewdriverThe magnetized screwdriver matches the blue HyperX color of the drive and includes two small driver bits (one flathead and one philips). It's not the highest quality screwdriver, but for those that find the branding to be cool (like me), the screwdriver is a great addition. An almost identical, but unbranded screwdriver, can be found at discount stores like Big Lots, for about $10.* External USB drive enclosureThe USB enclosure is a fantastic way to migrate your current system to the new drive, especially for laptops. Laptops don't generally have multiple SATA ports like desktops, so without the USB enclosure, you'd have to connect both the HyperX SSD and the original laptop drive, to a desktop system to clone. Using the USB enclosure, I was able to easily clone a mechanical drive inside a MacBook Pro to the HyperX SSD. The USB enclosure is made out of plastic, which is fine for solid-state drives, since they give off much less heat than mechanical drives. Besides, its primary function is to use it temporarily for migration purposes. I wouldn't recommend using it with a mechanical drive as a permanent external drive, because of its lack of cooling properties. Similar enclosures sell for about $10-$15.* Acronis cloning softwareThe software CD includes a version of Acronis True Image that you can use to clone entire drives or image and restore individual partitions. It's not the full version that you install, but a boot-only version that lets you do most of the vital cloning and backup operations when installing or migrating drives. The full retail version of Acronis True Image costs about $30. Acronis True Image does not support Macs, so Mac users should download SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner for free.The generous upgrade kit is a refreshing departure from SSDs that don't include anything but the drives. I recently spoke with a rep from Monster Digital, who are just entering the SSD market with the full force of Monster Cable's marketing machine. When I asked them how they intended to differentiate their drives, he said that their packaging and bundle would set them apart. The thing is, Kingston's already done that with the HyperX upgrade kit.PERFORMANCEThe Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD was awesome inside a current MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop, and this was before I even upgraded the firmware to the latest version (3.3.2). Boot up times were reduced significantly, programs loaded almost instantly, and it ran stable for three straight weeks. Unfortunately, the MacBook Pro's display crapped out before I could run my benchmarks. To run my benchmarks, I ended up installing the HyperX to a desktop system with native SATA III ports on a Z68 motherboard.ATTO Disk BenchmarkATTO tests the raw performance of a drive and is the benchmark tool normally used when manufacturers advertise read/write performance.The HyperX 120GB SSD achieved max read speeds of 559MB/s and max write speeds of 518MB/s.CrystalDiskMarkCrystalDiskMark is a commonly used benchmark that can test performance of drives using random, incompressible data. Using incompressible data to measure performance can reveal the benefits of the faster, synchronous NAND flash, that the HyperX SSD uses. Many value-oriented SSDs use slower, asynchronous NAND flash.Read performance was exceptional at 489MB/s. SSD drives that use asynchronous memory can't keep up with the HyperX when using incompressible data. Write performance on the HyperX 120GB SSD was good as well (161MB/s), but the difference wasn't as pronounced as it was in read performance.SUPPORT &amp; WARRANTYThe Kingston support website provides a good bit of information on the HyperX SSD. You can download the install guide, a data sheet, and recent firmware revisions. Beyond that, the website also has a good FAQ section and a form you can fill out for support questions. Kingston warranties the HyperX SSD for 3 years.CONCLUSIONThe Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit is a very attractive bundle. Its high-end performance, visual appeal, and matching accessories, make the HyperX stand out. Gamers and performance enthusiasts should be extremely happy with the HyperX SSD upgrade kit. At about a $15 premium over the standard HyperX 120GB SSD, the upgrade kit is well worth the cost difference. If you're looking for a sweet-looking SSD with sweet performance to match, take a look at the Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit.* Review unit provided by Kingston

The security catch works as advertised even with Wimberly brackets which I know is important to some.The one thing I have a love hate relationship with on this is the auto-level catch. When you push it into position it will auto level the camera straight. This is cool and works very well. The problem is that you cant move anything unless this is disengaged and there is the slight issue. It can be slightly troublesome at times to flip the switch back to normal position.Oh yeah, the pano feature on this is awesome as well!

$REVIEW.: I knew not to expect a lot of volume from this small recorder, but so far I've not been happy with my recordings because they are difficult to hear. I have used new batteries, checked the volume control, but the recordings are still poor.  My good sense keeps the recorder from finding a home in the trash can.

There is no horizontal scrolling or side buttons. That being said, it's durable and functional, and the wireless works quite reliably. This would be more of a travel mouse, or a mouse for people with small hands. It feels a little too small for an average hand sized person to use as a primary mouse.

$REVIEW.: I have read all of the earlier reviews and agree with all the "pros" listed - for the amount of features, ease of use and , size, ability to lock on a signal - there is no better GPSr in this price range.I am an avid hiker, nature photographer and geocacher and I like to be able to recall my trips - document sites, features and sightings etc. This unit didn't let me down. Last weekend I took a day trip that included four different parks along a river system with high bluffs and DEEP ravines - in the car and on the ground, this unit never missed a beat, never lost signal lock.The unit was located in many places - in hand, in the cup holder of a van, in a zipped fanny pack, clipped to a belt, and at lunch, on the table at a tavern - not a problem, never lost signal. :) My last unit was a Garmin Vista Cx - this unit is MUCH better - better lock and faster draw.As far as the "cons" I've read - there are few and most are related to the price of maps, the accuracy of the maps or the manual.Concerning the price of the maps - there is no unit that comes close, at this price, (even considering the price of buying the maps) to this unit in speed and accuracy of plot. Anyone that did ANY research would know that maps are not part of the base price (not that I like or approve).The accuracy of the maps themselves, as far as roads are concerned, is poor (topo maps) - in my area there are major freeway junctions that have not been updated for over twenty years. The topo maps, however, are not bad - if you need road info, get the City Navigator maps.The manual I recieved with the Vista HCx is deficient, find and D/L the manual for the Vista Cx.The Garmin Vista HCx is a great, small, versatile GPSr that will do what you need.

I have a wireless router in the basement which provides plenty of signal to multiple devices in the basement as well as first floor.  However, 1 PC and iPad used on second floor get mediocre signal and low speeds.The TP-LINK paired quickly and painlessly.  I placed it on first floor, right above where the wireless router is located in the basement.  Per directions, 3 bars of strength is enough for this device to do its job.  Well, where I placed it, its getting full signal, however there is absolutely zero improvement in signal strength on my pc and ipad (and cell phones) on the second floor.  There could not be a more perfect &amp;#34;middle ground&amp;#34; spot for this other than where i placed it, but for argument sake, i moved it up to second floor, again directly above the wireless router.  At this location, the TP-Link was getting 3 bars of signal, again per manufacturer enough strength to do its job... Still, no effect on wifi strength or speed (test via speedtest.net) on either the ipad or the PC.  I am getting around 4mpbs with ipad and pc on second floor.  Moving the ipad to first floor increases the speed to 10, so I know there is definitely nothing wrong with the iPad as far as its internal wifi receiver. Moving it back up to second floor, speed goes down to 4 again.  Plugging the TP-Link on first or second floor - still 4mbps on the ipad.  Bottom line, I might just have a defective unit or they aren't as good as people make them out to be in their reviews.

I need to get an adapter to hook it into my mobo, but everything else is there.  I have a good good CPU fan and the GPU has two fans, and the airflow is great so I haven't needed the side fan.

$REVIEW.: As a Lacie user of some years at work and home, I recently retired the LaCie d2 (it was failing to initialize) in favor of this LaCie d2 quadra

My impressions of this new drive are:1) Same look, more space, does not auto turn off when I shutdown my pc.2) The "One touch" button is unnecessary (blue light button use to be the power button).3) The 3 setting power switch on the back is confusing.Bottom line: The price is right, the features are not.Cheers,Mike

$REVIEW.: The headphones sound simply amazing


 I imagine there may be technically better sounding ear bud style headphones out there, but am not sure if a listener could really decipher better sound than what these produce
 I had 1st gotten the AKG 460 Qunicy Jones set and returned those within 2 days
 I have been through a few sets of the MDR EX 51s and MDR EX 71s
 I thought they sounded great
 Until ofcourse I figured Id give these a try

 I forgot these in the office last week and had to go back to the MDR EX 71s for a day

 Thats when it hit just how amazing these sound

 These have a wider dynamic range


 The bass in these is very refined

 The treble is not harsh
 Overall after listening to the MDR EX 71s for less than 15 mins, I felt the fatigue because I had just gotten used to the sound of the MDR EX 500

 And I really liked the MDR 71s until I head these.I have had these for less than a year

 Can't speak alot about durability

 They seem durable but not alot, after all they are kind of fragile and have to be handled with care and may be unable to take a lot of beating
 I was more focussed on sound and in that department am not sure how much better one can do.

$REVIEW.: Have tested unit on familiar routes and was surprised with this NUVI 765T instructing to turn opposite direction from expressway ramp to location sites (even after downloading current maps). This unit suggest: "trust but verify".  The sound quality is great and very pleased with the quality of the screen visuals. Due this history of misdirections, I will chart a coarse the old fashion method and use the Garmin for a backseat driver.

$REVIEW.: This router does not really work across multiple WANs since it balances so aggressively that any IP restricted web sessions will fail
 This is a major limitation and I would strongly suggest avoiding this router as a result.Also:* There is no QoS by IP address or MAC address, only by physical ports
 You can reserve bandwidth by port and IP range (and can bind MACs to IPs), but that sets aside the bandwidth and isn't actually a solution.* As far as I can tell, there are routing bugs in the firmware

 Setting up custom routes, in order by precedent, doesn't seem to work right
 Forcing specific traffic onto specific WANs also seems inconsistent
 I could usually find more than one way to do things, but I shouldn't have to.I would strongly recommend trying a different router if you want to use both WANs
 I'm replacing mine with a Peplink Balance 30, so hopefully I'll have better luck with that.Update: The Peplink Balance router is fantastic and I highly recommend it for doing multi wan


 They have a 2 and 3 wan model (plus larger enterprise models).

$REVIEW.: I originally bought this hub because I wanted to charge/sync my iPhone while having other things plugged in, and with my computer only having two usb ports, then I had to buy a hub. So far this thing works flawlessly, I haven't had any problems with it. When I first got it, it came with an aluminum base, a power supply, and a screw to mount it on pretty much any surface. I highly recommend this product to anyone.

The best sound i've heard is from a 1970s EPI and JBL bookshelf -equalized by radio shack. The harmonics were stunning-like a fine violin-it captured you and held you there. The point is- This was a combination of excellent components,acoustics,and position. Individualy, it takes flexibility -or a whole lotta cash-to sustain this potential. Happy hunting!

Sorry if people need more info about the other two.The keyboard is full sized and the display is monochrome, but it's functional and if you can find and install apps for it I'm sure it could be really useful. The media buttons are oddly located but once you get used to them it actually makes a decent amount of sense where they placed 'em. Keys are springy without being hard to press, and the thing seems decently made though I wouldn't reccommend throwing it after losing in a game or something. The bluetooth part works (I already had a reciever, and it's a piece of poodoo but this thing connected easily so bonus) and that's about all I can say about that.Overall it's a decent keyboard. It's not what I'd call a primary board for a serious user, but if you're just surfing the net, watching movies, or whatever, it'd be fine. Then again I use my keyboard so much (Saitek Cyborg) that I've worn the chrome off the keys, worn a ditch in the frame where my thumb rests, and this is the second one I've done that too lol.

My husband is a school teacher, and sometimes the equipment in his classes futzes out. The projector comes to the rescue in seconds, and doesn't take any effort at all to set up. He plugs in his USB, and keeps on going as if nothing happened.Couple of notes:1) Everything on the USB needs to be either an image (JPG, TIFF, etc), or a movie file (mpeg-1). All other files are useless when using the functionality. They include a version of the Arcsoft media converter 3.0, along with a registration key, so that it's fully usesable. It's very intiutive software to use. Just drag and drop your media, and let 'er rip. If you're on Mac OSX, use any software that you'd ordinarily use, and convert it to MPG format, and you'll be golden. I'm running Parallels on a Macbook Pro running Leopard. I raced the OSX side (using Visual Hub) and the Parallels side (with arcsoft running), and of course the OSX side won, because it's not running in a virtual environment. That being said, Arcsoft only took like 20 or so minutes for the movie Dogma.Yes. You can drop DVDs into Arcsoft to convert it to USB. Pretty sweet, huh?2) The image AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS! I was sitting on my bed, projecting the image to a wall, and watching the movie from the USB port. If you want to imagine a perfectly tiny, comact setup, this is it in spades. Anyway. When I tilted the projector upwards so that it would show up higher on the wall, the image automatically adjusted itself so as not to be distorted in any way.3) The on-board audio is fine for a smaller room, but if you want any serious sound, hook it up to a PC speaker, or your audio setup you use right now. In my bedroom, it was no problem. If it's a small-ish conference room, I can't imagine it being any trouble either.4) Yes, you can hook up your iPhone or iPod Touch, but you have to buy the media cable that gives it audio and video out, so it'd essentially be like you're hooking up the iPod to your TV.5) It only comes with VGA input for computers. In other words, the audio isn't going to carry through to your projector. It'll come from the computer.6) To project powerpoint from the USB input, you go to PowerPoint, save the presentation as a JPG, and go from there. This is a GOOD thing in my eyes, because all those stupid "cute" effects that people throw into PowerPoint presentations will not carry through. Use powerpoint like it's intended to be used: as a visual help for your presentation, and NOT AS YOUR PRESENTATION.7) You will quietly find /reasons/ to use your projector. I'm not kidding. It's a fun little tool to have. I can already envision parties in my head. Turn down the lights, close the curtains, and pop up some popcorn, and sit around watching movies that take up the space of my WALL. Which is so freaking cool. Unlike traditional projectors, the image being sent to the white walls was startlingly clear.8) While playing movies on the USB input, the remote behaves exactly like a DVD player's remote. You can even fast forward up to 32x. Pretty cool if you ask me.The creators of the product have made this to be a fun thing to have around the house. The manual is not read. It's looked at, because it's all done in pictures, not words. You can download the full PDF of the manual onto your computer, but the base manual is very cute, and small, and meant to be unintimidating.In other words, don't think of this as a Serious Expensive Projector that must only be used for Serious Things. Play around, and see what it's got to offer. Use it for fun stuff. Impress your friends with having awesome movie nights at your house. Most of all, use it! It's not meant to sit in the box, and be an expensive decoration. It's meant to be used!

The product is high quality.  Works great with my rebel 500D (T1i).  There is  optical adjustment in the eye piece that helps those of us who need a little help seeing.  My only compliant is price.  But there are no alternatives out there that I am aware of.

It was my first gaming mouse although I've gamed for many years.  Let me boil down this review into three main points:1. The MX518 is a good quality mouse that is very versatile2. The MX518 is a one of my two favorite mouses for under-$60 but just satisfactory if you have more funds or want a hardcore gaming mouse3. The MX518 could use several tweaks but remains a classic gaming mouse1: The mouse held up very well to continual all-day use in an office-type environment for twelve hours straight, seven months before it was ever used for gaming and the only wear was the silver logitech sign was a little faded and the plastic gloss peeled up a little in the area around the wheel and dpi switchers.  I must say it worked very well for many gaming applications of a very diverse group.  I could be playing a face-paced shooter one moment, a turn-based strategy game the next, and a combat flight simulator the next and never did I feel the mouse was under-performing or out of place.  A simple click of the dpi buttons was the most I ever had to do to get into "gear" for a different genre game.BONUS: If you are a real time strategy gamer, this mouse's dpi switching buttons are so easy to access and change that micromanaging units or quickly selecting large areas are made enormously easy in a matter of microseconds.2: This is a great mouse for people who are just beginning to get into serious gaming or those who just want to step up their game a little without spending a ton of money.  The mouse is serious enough and delivers enough extras to make gaming easier and more comfortable without an enormous price tag.  The only other mouses I've seen to do that are theMicrosoft SideWinder X3 Mouseand theMicrosoft SideWinder X5 Mouseand the MX518 is a lot closer to the Sidewinder X5 in terms of performance.For those who are already hardcore gamers I would suggest theMicrosoft SideWinder Gaming MouseorLogitech G9X Laser Mouse.  For those who are looking to jump in head first into gaming mice but don't want to go to hardcore all at once, I would suggest theLogitech Gaming Mouse G500 (Black/Silver),Razer Lachesis 4000 dpi Laser Gaming Mous--Banshee Blueor the truly classic but slightly datedLogitech G5 Laser Mouse (Blue/Black).3: My gripes with this mouse are that the 'back' and 'forward' buttons on the left side of the mouse were sometimes a little awkward to push depending on your gaming posture.  Another issues was the ring finger and pinkie placement (for right-handed users) on the mouse sometimes caused the pinkie to be dragged around uncomfortably.  With time the cord also seemed to get a little worn.  Finally, if one gamed for over a couple hours the logitech symbol would be branded into one's palm for a short period of time afterwards.Even with all these issues, I must give the MX 518 it's due respect and say it is a great mouse for many gamers and enthusiasts alike.

I held off initially because the 3.0 (Honeycomb) OS just wasn't ready.  So I held off.  I finally dove in with 3.1 and was quickly upgraded to 3.2 and most (if not all) of the biggest issues are now resolved.Most people want to know what they problems are first, so they can figure out if they really want it.  So I will cover them first.1.  The Xoom is heavier than most other comparable out now.  If you plan to use this as an e-Reader, this is an issue. (Note you will also find this under the plus section as well)2.  Price.  It only comes in a 32GB model, so the price (appears) higher than comparable items (that only pack 16 GB of storage).  Though you are getting more for your money, it is a higher entry point, and that makes it a non-starter for some.3.  Smudges.  Motorola has a habit of putting glass on their products that seem to attract smears and streaks, like no other product on the planet.4.  Honeycomb.  This is another plus and minus.  I put it here, because many of the "flaws" that people find in the Xoom were problems with the 3.0 version of Honeycomb.  The device unfairly gets the blame here.  Now that 3.2 is out, those have gone away, but the perception of problems with the Xoom persist, even though they are gone.5.  Honeycomb Part 2... There is presently less than stellar number of apps designed for Honeycomb.  It is getting better by the day, and as the market grows, so will the number of apps and games, but for now, if you like to play games on your device, you will find the experience limiting.OK, so now we got the bad out of the way, lets cover the good.1.  Sturdy.  Some complain about the weight of the Xoom, but it feels and is SOLID.  It is not flimsy, and you don't feel like it is going to snap in your hands if you put just a bit too much pressure on it.2.  Productivity.  Since this device (and Honeycomb) is built as a tablet OS and not just a big iPod Touch (like the iPad) it is meant for getting things done.  The Widescreen layout and easy connection of a Bluetooth keyboard, along with apps like Evernote make this a great out of the box productivity tool.3.  Flash, it runs it and as well as any device.  iOS will NEVER be able to do that.4.  No corners cut.  It has 32 GB of storage, 1 GB of RAM and an SD Card slot (which now works as of Honeycomb 3.2).  Others cut one of those corners to lower the price... but cheaper is not necessarily good if you are getting less as well.Overall, while there are pluses and minuses to any tablet, the reputation (which really belongs to the early release of Honeycomb) is the only real "problem" with the Xoom.  If you want to get things done... this is the device to get.  If you want an e-reader or something to play games on... then you may wish to look at something else.

I was looking for a receiver low in cost, reliable, and one that was easy to set up.  Features, most of which I wouldn't know how to use, were not a priority, though this receiver seems to have plenty of features.I'm VERY happy with this receiver so far.  I almost didn't buy it, based on some reviews that mentioned an 80 page instruction manual.  But based on the reputation of Yamaha, I chose it over an Onkyo.Here's what I'd tell you about the 80 page instruction manual: it's a CD, not paper, and you choose which language you want, and then either print it off, or have it viewable on a tablet or laptop as you set up the system.  I'd normally HATE an 80 page instruction manual, but this one is really well done, and very user friendly.  A lot of thought and time went in to it; it's easy to follow, and understand.  I can't believe I'm giving an 80 page manual an &amp;#34;A+&amp;#34;, but this one deserves it.  Not only did it make it easy to set up the system, it also educated me (again, I'm not a 25 year old audiophile, but a 49 year old guy with limited appetite for this kind of stuff) on everything that a surround sound system can do.I really like the option of choosing settings for different kinds of movies, and for music, choosing different types of listening settings (Munich concert hall, Vienna concert hall, etc.).  I would have thought this to be goofy overkill until I played around with it, but can now see it's a useful feature.My primary use is TV (any music program run through this system sounds tremendous), also playing an iPod through it (again, sounds tremendous), while my son plays an Xbox through it (he's very impressed as well).My center speaker, subwoofer, and ceiling speakers are Polk Audio; front / wall speakers are from Madisound. Everything sounds great!As for all the cables (HDMI, subwoofer, etc.) needed to hook everything up: got it through Amazon at a third, to a quarter, of what Best Buy wanted for the same stuff.As usual, very happy with Amazon for no sales tax, free shipping, and VERY rapid delivery.Thanks Yamaha, Polk Audio, and Amazon.  I'm going to really enjoy this!

$REVIEW.: I ordered two of these keyboards because the prices were less expensive than Samsung's own SmartTV keyboard in addition they work with PCs and Macs
 I plug in the unifying USB receiver into an available USB slot on the back of the television and the television instantly recognized the keyboard and it worked pretty well
 Both the keys and the trackpad moved the mouse pointer on the television easily
 Some of the Fn function keys such as F7 and F8 replicate channel changing buttons, F8 brings up the television's menu
 It just takes a little trial and error to figure out what function they perform on the television.I also have a Dell Laptop with a Logitech mouse that uses an identical unifying USB receiver

 I didn't not have any problems mating the keyboard with the receiver on the laptop and the keyboard and pad worked flawlessly.The one thing about this keyboard that bothered me was the right handed shift key
 My bad really, I should have noticed the layout before ordering

 I'm a full keyboardist and the right shift key is practically useless because it is so tiny


 This keyboard would have been perfect had they decided to move the arrow keys underneath the track-pad


 There is plenty of room for the arrow keys there and it would have given more room to put a full-size right-hand keyboard


 If you type with all ten fingers, the right-hand shift key may bother you

 On the positive note, since the Samsung television works with the unifying receiver, it would seem that any other Logitech wireless keyboard with a unifying receiver would work with these televisions
 But finding a small one with a track-pad might be difficult


 For this oversight, I took away one star.By the way, the Samsung television I paired this keyboard with is a 2013 model Samsung UN55F6400 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Slim Smart LED HDTV

 A friend of mine has a 2011 D8000 series and I will bring the second keyboard over to his house and see if the keyboard works with these earlier televisions

 I'll update my review when I find out.Update 8/25/2013 ===============================I had the opportunity to try out the second keyboard on Samsung UN55D8000 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver), Samsung UN46D6400 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D LED HDTV (Black) and a Samsung UN32EH5300 32-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LED HDTV (Black)
 Of these three television sets, only the UN32EH5300 recognized the keyboard

 This leads me to believe that this keyboard will only work with 2012 models and newer and not the 2011 Samsung TV

 So  if your Samsung television has a letter "E" or  later letter in the alphabet in the 5th character position of the model number, this keyboard will likely work with your television


 If it has a letter "D" or preceding letter in the alphabet, you are probably out of luck :(I hope this helps anyone with 2011 models and earlier


 If you have a 2012, you are probably good.

The unit works like it should and that's the most important thing.Previous review:Edit Nov. 18, 2012:I'm still having issues with this model holding a charge. My observations over a couple months indicate it seems to lose it's charge after a day or so. Ambient is sending me a replacement battery and I'm hoping that will solve the problem.Initial review:Initially I had a problem whereby I could not change the Mode from WB but after talking with Ed at Ambient Technical Support I was able to take out the battery, press through the small hole underneath to reset it and voila! all modes could be changed.From what I can tell, having read Ed's comments on other users posts here and also calling and receiving live help from Ed, the support for this product is exceptional.I'm unable to receive the emergency broadcast stations at home but they do come in elsewhere. Though that's dissapointing I'm going to have to overlook that as I find it more important to have this.Lastly I've had to use the reset button twice now to get it to work, apparently after the battery drained even though it had been fully charged and went unused for about 2 weeks time. I was going to return it before the 30 days that Amazon would cover the return but am deciding to keep it even with these issues.

$REVIEW.: Having tried a D-Link DNS-320 and plenty of homebrew solutions, I was apprehensive about purchasing another piece of network gear that would not work as expected
 I tried FreeNAS, but it required a good amount of memory and seemed inefficient to keep a PC up all the time just for home network needs
 USB drives attached to routers worked well, but I wanted something more robust for media storage and Time Machine, preferring external drives for imaging of systems

 The DNS-320 had promise, but was buggy from the start
 As I continued to try and use it, it could not be consistently seen by the network, even after multiple resets


 You should be able to set it and forget it with such a device, in my opinion
 The software interface to the DNS-320 was clunky at best when it worked

 Obviously I do not recommend that model, which appears to be discontinued, thankfully, and is probably underpowered by today's standards


 The DS212j is definitely an upgrade from the DNS-320, which it should be given that it is twice as expensive, but still a good bargain considering all the functions it handles, including backup and media storage (although to be fair the NAS must still be backed up, for which I personally recommend using bare SATA drives in an USB cradle, swapping them out on regular basis and storing offsite and/or a home safe)


 And it works, allowing for OS X, PC, iOS, and Android access
 I can now see the network shares for Time Machine, iTunes, and other media

 It also has a neat option to allow for web camera recording directly to the NAS, which actually works as promised


 This is the low end of Synology's units, clearly made for home use, but it appears reliable in the few weeks of use, with no failures or issues
 Only minor quibble would be the alert sounds that appear to be on by default, and those were easily toggled to remain silent


 The software interface is easy to understand, with more features than I need, but nice to know they are there (and regularly updated)

 All around a great investment, just be sure to check the Synology website for approved drives (which you must add yourself)
 Definitely recommended.

Both models are heading to the back seat where they are being replaced , if youre not into 3d then why bother go get yourself a deal on the older models i say top of the line for good prices why not. Now for the nitty gritty the marantx set is quite a beau as it looks well built and that copper plating is quite predominant so is the torodial transformer they put in for the sound section and all the RCAs are plated as well so kudos for marantz in continung their search for audio excellence. As inputs go its really a tonne. i have cut down on so many things as of late so its well enough for me not to complain about it.the unit is running a play station move , an oppo 83 blu ray player , emotiva erc 1 cd player , a screenplay sp 5000 did i say 2 hdmi video outs same as my sc 27 the reason i didint get me a pre amp se[erate as they are well way too expensive and a direct t v satellite receiver. All seem to work so the connections must be right. the speakers they are running for 5.1 surround THX is the magnepan system of 1.7 and the mmgw and the mmgc, the sound quality from the unit was really warm but a little to constrained for my liking but i blame them on my speakers, so i up graded right away by adding on a 2 channel power amp xpa 2 and that relaesed the unit in spades imaging , soundstage and depth just exploded. it seemed to let the rear surrounds and center channel breathe a little better, the pre out section that the unit has surprised me and all i can say is it can do it. my dining  room is where my reference system is and i compare everything to it and this combo challenged them really well. i ran the system in for 4 days continous and everyday it sounded better, when i finally get the time to read the owners manual ill get up to speed and write some more at a later date, so if u want a good audio section to be the herat of an av system get the marantz its better or on par with most out there. ps it does lack some detail when challenging the higher end systems but you gotta pay a lot more for audio nirvana,,, my 2 cents.systems tested, onkyo 3007 my kitchen setup hah hah wife went on holiday and i upgraded everything with last years heros, denon 3805 , pioneer sc 27 , musical fideluty A 100, michealson audio tube integrated and my old faithfull krells ksa.

$review_text.: A review of a lens cap.  I have to say I like the way the Nikon lens cap works and how easy it is to take it off and replace it.  Because the mechanism for releasing the cap is triggered by squeezing the pieces on the front of the cap, it is nearly impossible to end up with a slipping finger to mark-up the glass on the front of your lens.  The cap stays on securely and protects the lens, as necessary.

$REVIEW.: For the money these are a great buy. The buds are super comfortable and stick in my ear wonderfully. They dont move around and they came with three sets of rubber tips to fit just like you want. They deliver very good sound and a pretty heavy bass when considering what they cost. They have a sturdy feel and I have paid more for earbuds that felt cheap and fell apart with just a few uses. I do not believe this will be the case with these.I got the glowing ones and they stick out in my gym bag when digging them out of my bag in a dark car. In regular light though they just appear white, which I like. The zipper works well and definitely works to keep them from tangling up. I like being able to customize the fit and they can be zipped up high keeping them close to my body or zipped down for a more relaxed fit that allows the wires to move more. Overall the cord is longer than I expected and should work with most any wear style.I am happy with the purchase and the ingenious design of them.

by far, the best HTCP/Price is fry's Antec NSK2480 for 50 dollars, and the best looking case is Silver Stone GD05B

but this is a review for black micro case, so let's get to it.1st of all, this is a good basic computer case

it came with a PSU which is great for the price it is demanding.now let's talk about few issues here if you use it for HTPC:1
does not fit ATX PSU2
does not fit ATX M/B3

does not fit more than 2 HDD4


does not fit 2.5 inch HDD without a 2.5 to 3.5 enclosure.5


a super, and i mean SUPER loud 80mm fan.now you might say: why the heck do you expect ATX stuff to fit in this case when it is a mATX case? well, the foot print of this case is every bit as large as ATX
Yes
the don't be fooled by the picture, this case is HUGE

it is narrow, but huge

this case is actually a good deal bigger than silver stone GD05, which fits a full size ATX power supply, full size graphic card 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch.so if you are thinking about building a HTPC, ignore reviews who uses this case for HTPC, they are obviously new to what HTPC case should look like

HTPC case doesn't care about the height (this case is about half the height of regular AVR), it cares about the depth and width
it cares about silence

this case is very deep, you won't be able to fit into your regular depth TV Cabinet
this case is very low, which means you cannot use 120 mm fan and pretty much forced to use the 80 mm fan it came with (and it is loud)

and the front panel looks way to cheap next to your thousand dollar AVR
i would give it 2 star for HTPC if that's what you want to use it for.NOW, this case did not advertise itself to be HTPC case, and i can tell you it cannot be a HTPC case (unless your definition of HTPC is a any computer output video to TV or AVR, in which case, my laptop might be a better HTPC)
How does it perform as desktop case? pretty good as a matter of fact
i would give it 3 stars


i have to, once again, deduct one star for lack of 120 MM fan and lack of 2.5 inch HDD native support
i would like to deduct 1 more star for lack of utilization of space: there is a ample amount of space wasted in the front, they would 1: get additional HDD space, 2: move the PSU to the front and free up some of the space.



$SUMMARY.: you got to be kidding me using this case for HTPC

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these to make my new (at the time) iPad II safe during travel and in my work situations
It made the slim, lovely, iPad into a bulky, highly protected, but still fully functioning street computer

The screen protecter works great, the snap-on stand is a so-so feature, but the case is great for protecting the tablet


The button/speaker/connector covers are a little difficult to open and keep out of the way, but that's the price you pay for protection.Mine did not come with a cover for the front of the protected screen, but I made one up from a piece of formica, a 1/4" piece of foam, and a flat strap, mostly for traveling.All in all a great way to protect your treasured tablet.

$REVIEW.: I've had my Intel DZ77GA-70K motherboard installed and running for almost 3 months now. Here are my system specs:- Intel i7-3770k CPU (Retail, boxed, used Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound)- Intel RTS2011 Liquid Cooling CPU cooler with 120mm fan- Intel DZ77GA-70K motherboard running 0064 BIOS (flashed to 0064 on 3/15/2013)- Crucial 32GB DDR3 RAM (Ballistix Sport)- Intel 120GB Model 330 SSD (SATA III)- PNY GTX 650 video card- WD 3TB Red hard drive (SATA III)- Corsair 650D case with 3 x 200mm fans- Corsair 750AX power supply- LG DVD RW drive- Monsoon Planar speakers and subwoofer- Windows 7 Enterprise 64bit OSI'm overclocking the CPU, and I'm at 4.5GHZ at 32 degrees C at rest and 75 degrees C at 100% CPU utilization. The board was extremely easy to setup, tweak and leave running. I've updated the BIOS several times and the last time (0064), I had to set my BIOS settings to "default" prior to applying the BIOS update and everything worked once I did that. I have never had a BSOD and the PC runs very well. I use the BIOS to update my settings (overclocking) as I found this is more reliable than the Intel Extreme Performance Utility that runs on Windows 7. All drivers are current and I'm 100% satisfied with this motherboard, it really shines with this CPU! I'm not a gamer (hence the GTX 650 video card), but I tested my son's GTX 660 OC video card in my PC and it was fantastic and the performance in the latest games (BF3, Crysis 3, etc...) was smooth and fast!I use my PC for work and I use a lot of virtual machines and Oracle's VirtualBox runs great on this PC and the VM's perform just like an actual PC running that particular OS, which is what I wanted. Documentation is there, you just have to search for it on Intel's website and the accompanying technical information is staggering, if you want to read it! The Corsair 650D is a big, heavy case, but it holds all of the components, keeps them cool and I can't hear any fans at all, so it's doing exactly what I expect it to do. I read up on the issues some others had with this board, but I have not had any issues at all, so this is just another data point... I'm not an employee of Intel and have no financial interest in Intel, I'm just a very satisfied customer! BTW, I'll be installing Win8 soon and I'll update my review after that experience... Thanks!Update on 5/9/2013 after moving to Windows 8...I've upgraded my system to Win8 and I also have Classic Shell installed, so the PC boots to the desktop and Classic Shell interface, so it looks just like Win7, but is Win8. Win8 runs faster and has a few features that I really like (much improved file transfer interface, better task manager, better device managemr functionality, etc...). The upgrade was realy a clean install as I had an image backup of my Win7 install and my data is all backed up on my home server. I strongly recommend the clean install and not the in-place upgrade or dual-boot approach as I had issues with both of those. No problems at all and I'm running at 4.5GHz (45x100 bclock)and my temps are lower than 95 degrees F. I put another fan on my Intel liquid cooling radiator, so it's now configured as a "push-pull" (one fan on each side of the fan, both arrors in the same direction) and the temps dropped 10 degrees F, so it really works without making too much noise. I'm 100% satisfied!

$review_text.: There are a ton of reviews here so I won't repeat everything about the system itself, but here is the absolute best way to setup these cameras:1. Make sure your home router and cable/DSL/fiber modem are all connected to a UPS.2. Purchase a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch with enough ports to handle however many cameras you will be setting up.3. Connect the PoE switch to a free port on your router, and plug the power connection into the UPS.4. Run network cable from the new PoE switch through your attic, basement, etc. to each location where you want to mount a camera (drop it down through the ceiling for ceiling mount, through the soffit panels for exterior undermount, into a standard RJ45 jack enclosure if you want to just sit the camera on a shelf inside, etc.). Use bulk network cable for this and simply crimp the RJ45 ends on the cable at each end (or for a more professional setup terminate the cables into a patch panel near the PoE switch).5. Connect each camera to your remote cable location using only the network port on the camera (no need to use power adapters, in fact when you purchase additional cameras Logitech now sells versions that don't include the powerline network adapters. These sell for significantly less too!)6. Use the software as specified to configure the cameras... you're done!This setup allows you to easily place cameras anywhere in your house with no need to run bulky (and potentially dangerous) AC wiring or extension cords. The cameras are connected straight to your network for maximum reliability. Since the PoE switch is the only source of power, and since it is connected to your UPS, then all the cameras will continue to record even if the power goes out. Since your router and modem are also connected to the UPS you will still be able to monitor your cameras remotely when the power is out as well.

But that's where the fun ends.  Installed pretty easy and was up and running fairly quickly. So much for the good part - The system itself is pretty lame.  Camera quality is pretty grainy. You're given two video resolutions but neither are good.  More like "worst" and "less worse".I have mine set to monitor both camera "flip flop" style. One image displays for a few seconds and then switches to the other camera's image. I then have it set to auto-record on motion. For whatever reason, it only picks up motion once in a while. Not reliable at all when you want to have a record of activity. I'm not saying it doesn't work, just not 100%. In my estimation, it's between 50 and 70 percent. Not great - but even good? Apart from the motion detection / recording flaw, I've had the unit lock up on me.  Another hit to the reliability factor. The screen quality is bad too. A 7" is actually an okay size and it looks like a digital picture frame. But the picture is so washed out the color is nearly non-existent. Looks like some sick black and white version. Record time is severely limited if you use the "less worse" video mode with the provided 2GB SD card. You're guaranteed to need a larger card if you go with this camera - plan on at least 8GB or better and factor that into the cost. Range is also another big factor - if you house is 2,000+ square feet - plan on buying the "optional antenna" from Lorex for another 100 bucks. My signal fades even though the cameras aren't more than 50-100 ft from the base station. Another problem is you can't auto-record when you're in quad view. Expanding to the 4 cameras the system supports is another "surprise" in that the cameras actually cost more than buying another system.  That is to say each camera is at least $165 so you're better off buying two systems. That's kind of strange to me.  You can get a cheaper version of the camera that has one-way audio - no intercom feature. It's just over $100 from what I've seen.I do like the intercom feature - kind of creepy but works pretty well. Since I have the cameras in front of my house though, it doesn't do me much good unless I want to call the kids inside or say hello to my neighbors. (The creepy factor...)I hope the simple presence of the cameras will provide some security but if you rely on this thing to do the job for you - you'll be sorely disappointed as I was. (Not to mention a few hundred dollars lighter and proud owner of a lame duck security system.)Here's some things that would make this system better / acceptable:1.) Camera range / picture quality2.) Distance motion detection (Most things are not going to be right in front of the camera) The distance should reach at least 100ft day/night. Right now it's maybe 50ft day, 10-12ft at night.3.) Battery option for the camera - having them outside means rigging power to your "wireless" camera4.) External storage - USB port5.) Higher video quality6.) Reliability - no lockups, etc

$review_text.: Brought this for my HP DV2911 laptop to use in the office.  It is connected to an external scanner, printer, network cable, mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, and external hardisk.  Worked perfectly from day one just like my old IBM and Toshiba docking stations.  I now come to the office, take out my laptop and plug in one cable, hit the power button and I'm working.  A nice bonus feature is I can use both the external monitor and laptop monitor together when I need to compare or edit 2 documents.  Nice!The unit doesn't come with a power supply, but it is also about 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a full docking station.  I had to buy another power supply for home use.  Also, I don't know if this is fully compatible with non HP laptops, but if you have an HP laptop, this is great.

It offers a certain degree of protection against minor bumps or vibration, and prevents scratches.  It is somewhat oversized for an E-P2 with the M. Zuiko 14-42 mm kit lens, and it is somewhat too tight with the Lumix G 45-200mm lens.It comes with two options for attaching it to the camera - either to the tripod socket or to a rubber ring that goes around the lens.All in all, this is a good compromise between size and the degree of protection, albeit I would like to see this kind of armor with a more rigid construction.

$REVIEW.: This review is being written 12/2/2012 for Uniden BT1021 Cordless Phone Battery 2.4 Volt, Ni-MH 750mAh - Replacement fo UNIDEN BT-1008, BT-1016, sold by third party vendors who advertise on the Amazon website.This battery replaced the OEM unit in the Uniden phone OK.  It contains two AAA batteries connected together and surrounded by an outer jacket.  Its performance is rather weak, but that is more the fault of the phone design and decision to use AAA's to save weight and cost vs. AA's which last longer and are used in some other Uniden phones.  Even with the so-called power-saving design on the newer Uniden phones, the AA-designed units last longer between charges for me.Overall, I'd recommend this product as long as the price is cheap.

 I love the feature that automatically detects smiles and snaps pictures while video is being taken

$review_text.: I was not sure I'd have any use for the Monster Mobile PowerCard Portable Battery, after all I have chargers for my iPhone.  However it turned out to be a cool little gadget.  The one I got is a cool metallic red color.  While it is about the size of a credit card the thickness is a little more than a USB plug - since a USB plugs into it.  So while they say you could carry it in your wallet that's not really true I don't think.  However it is small and light and easily will fit in your pocket.  You charge it via a mini USB plug and it comes with a short cord but you will need your own USB plug for the wall outlet.  I've used it with an iPhone 5 and it seems to be good to inject about 75% power into my phone.  It's kind of cool to have portable power as an option.  I could see it being very handy on a trip or an emergency but it's cool at home too as you can charge your phone and keep it with you or close by at the same time.  So it turned out to be a cool device I'd recommend to someone.

$REVIEW.: Can't complain so far


 Ordered on Jun 27, free shipping, and received Jul 2


 I ordered mine through Amazon, but I notice some are sold through JoWow (cheaper, but with shipping added)

I don't know if this might explain some of the different experiences

 Also, there are a lot of fakes out there

 Using an Olympus E-510, I've never counted how many shots I can take at one time, but I don't really expect it to keep up with 8Mb+ SHQ JPeg files forever

$REVIEW.: I've never used a GPS before so if  you are clueless as I was when picking one out - this one is an excellent choice. Couldn't be much easier - works right out of the box.  Nice voices to choose from - I chose the British dude, and named him Geoff. Geoff really knows his way around and hasn't steered me wrong yet. Bright screen, easy to read. I can get lost in my driveway so this little device is a godsend. The suction cup mount for your windshield really sticks - no worries about it falling off, its on there. Simply put - I Love this thing. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: My TV is an older model with only two HDMI ports.  I have a Tivo, Blu-Ray DVD player and a Roku 3.  I bought the switch so I wouldn't have to keep attaching and detaching devices.  Everything connected easily and I liked having the switch with it's own pigtail cable.  Pressing a button on the switch changes the connections to whatever input device is desired. An LED light shows clearly which cable is the active one.

$REVIEW.: All I can say after clicking few shots with my Nikon D-5200 is WOW. It takes 5-10 shots to me to get adjusted with focus and few other settings and after that this lens rocks. Sharpness is top notch and I was easily able to focus as on D-5200 it is manual focus. Excellent Lens for macro and portrait work. Far better than Nikon 85 MM macro.
$review_summary.: Super Lens

Must buy if you are having low budget and wanna great pic.

$review_text.: I managed to pick up an open box S580 at Best Buy the same week it was released. More on that towards the end...I've based my opinion of this Sony S580 compared to Samsung's 2010 top of the lineBD-C7900-- the player with two HDMI outputs. That was (briefly) my first Hi-Def DVD player, after our six year-oldSony 5-disc carouselbegan spitting discs. But I couldn't help it -- I returned the Samsung shortly after seeing Sony's S580 coming out at $100 less than what I paid for the open box Samsung.I was hoping Sony had stepped up their game with respect to the on-screen interface and Netflix queue. Unfortunately, not: Sony's menu system on the S580 is pretty staid, the straight-forward line-by-line menus close to what they were offering on last year's x70 models. Back also is the unsortable grid layout Netflix queue. This is a big contrast to Samsung's flashier menus with expanding menu icons (ala Apple's taskbar on OS X) and a more dynamic Netflix selection page (though it, too, is more flash than substance and leaves a lot to be desired). Oh, and Sony's remote is horrible for entering text, for instance when searching for a video on YouTube.But the Sony's nuts and bolts are all tight: The Sony "feel" is more substantial than the feather-light Samsung. It's got four goofy yet functional, no-nonsense little match-head buttons, not the sleek buttonless, LED-backlit touch sensitive panel of the Samsung. Both players start up within seconds. Sony's got a boring, compact remote but it feels well built and comfortable, not Fisher-Price like Samsung's. And there's something about Sony's tray opening and closing that just feels like it's able to put up with some abuse, and will be around for a while.Basically for me it came down to this tired old summary: I'd date the Samsung, but marry the Sony.Sony setup was a breeze, Bluray playback has been uneventful, SD playback is super cleaned-up so no complaints of the upscaling (thought it's obviously not comparable to BluRay quality), can't comment on 3D yet since I'm still waiting on my TV, Pandora works great for just playing in the background, and YouTube videos are actually watchable (but entering search queries is a slow pain in the kiester). The player is dead quiet -- little whisper of a wind up whine, but basically silent once it gets going. Wireless networking is finally built in (not a dongle), and the connection to my home PC happened with the click of a (remote) button.Amazon's house brand HDMI cablesare working without a hitch, but again, I've yet to play 3D content with them.Now, the cautionary part. I bought mine open box, and whoever had it before me registered NetFlix. I was stuck with their Dora the Explorer-themed queue, and it actually takes a call to NetFlix to deregister it. Can't just hit the reset button. And, believe it or not, NetFlix doesn't do customer support stuff like this over email (at least, that's what I was able to decipher -- I hope I'm wrong, but don't think so). So if you're planning on grabbing one of these as a return from Amazon's WarehouseDeals.com, just expect a little extra difficulty getting up and running.Samsung has a whole slew of their really sexy, beautiful 2011 'D'-series players coming out now and in the next couple months, but I just feel more confident with this (relatively) solid feeling Sony player sitting on the shelf. Sony's user interface may be a little conservative and lack pizazz,  but Samsung's flashiness is already getting knocked for Netflix bugs and promised operating system updates.Edit 4/7: After talking a little smack about the 2010 Samsung players, and seeing the Sony S580 price dip to the $150 price point, I (1) returned my $200 open-box S580 to Best Buy due mainly to the Netflix issue I mentioned with the intention of buying a sealed unit from Amazon, but then (2) had the opportunity to check out Samsung's 2011 units. I ended up purchasing a 2011 Samsung BD-D6700 from Amazon... I wrote a bunch about this decision (and the ordeal surrounding this seemingly simple DVD player purchase) below, in the comments to this review, in response to Ty Harden's (largely justified) criticism of my inability to make up my mind. It may be worth your time to read, especially if you're thinking of upgrading just the DVD player but using an older TV or receiver.

$review_text.: We have our HF and a regular DirecTV receiver in our media room with RF run by cables from there to TVs in our great room, two bedrooms and a craft room. The remote reviewed here is RF so its signal goes through walls to a little IR transmitter pointed at the normal DirecTV receiver in the media room closet. We can carry the remote around the house, or we could have bought two or more, to control the channel on the non-HD TVs. I send the DirecTV signal around the house on channel 3, a DVD player on channel 66 and a VHS player on channel 77.I titled this review "Replacement" because an identical one broke when dropped after five years good service. Teaching the remote from the DirecTV remote is very easy.

The filters are great and I was able to screw the polarizing filter on to my camera and use it right away. I found the large carry case footprint to come in the way of travelling without bulky camera bags. A small hard case which takes all three filters with a foam insert would have been fine.The pen was a little hard to figure out. I would up opening the back cap and spilling the cleaning fluid overy my desk. Once you figure out how the cleaner, brush and pen style fluid dispenser works, its smooth sailing. The lens cap retainer came in handy but the lanyard was a little short for the giant 72mm cap. Sometimes, the dangling cap came into my field of view.The flare hood is still a mystery and I am using the flare hood that came with my Nikkor 18-200 mm zoom lens. The spare lens cap is handy when you lose the OEM cap and it even looks like the Nikon lens cap!All in all, I am not complaining about the value. Just for the three filters alone, I was happy to pay the price. Amazon service, as always was superb and I got the materials in time for my trip.

I specifically went with an Axim because of the CF-II slot, knowing a microDrive would give me at least 4Gb of storage.  Well, as things tend to improve over time, so did the storage capacity of these little babies.  I took a plunge on the 6Gb model.Now, a quick note about microDrives.  If you intend to use one in a digital camera or PDA, you need a retail microDrive.  The OEM ones or the ones harvested from MP3 players like the Creative Muvo2 or Rio Carbon are ROM masked to IDE mode.  In short, they won't work in your PDA or digital camera, no matter how hard you hack.  You either have to wait for the PDA's operating system to support IDE transfers on CompactFlash (and Microsoft's Windows Mobile 5 purports to do exactly this), or go retail.I went retail, of course, getting the full manufacturer's warranty and the security of knowing it would work... and it sure did.  5.71Gb instantly seen (6Gb is the raw, unformatted number), and about twenty minutes later (slow external card reader), I had filled it with 600 songs.I've been using it with my Axim for a few days now, and it's everything I expected.

$REVIEW.: I received this adapter in exchange for a review. I would love to give this a solid five stars, if for no other reason than it exceeded my expectations. I had a crashed hard drive that had been laying in my desk for years. In practically no time I was able to see and copy files that I thought were forever lost. Needless to say I was both thrilled and grateful.However, this review needs to point out the fact that I have well over thirty-five years of technical experience that enabled me to figure out how to use this on my own. Had I needed to depend on the documentation I would have been lost. That is the weak point and why I subtracted a star.The package itself is amazingly complete, and anyone who has a technical background will be pleased. There is an adapter for any SATA or IDE hard drive in 2.5 or 3.5 inch form factors that you are likely to encounter. I was able to connect using just the adapter that connects to my laptop's USB port without needing the included power supply. The drive was powered via the USB port and the wheezing old XP system immediately recognized it.If you are non-technical this will be a puzzle. First, the documentation mentions jumper settings, but does not explain what a jumper is, nor even what one looks like. A little more discussion and some illustrations showing examples would have gone a long way. And especially so since this adapter may not work if your drive is set to anything but MASTER. The last three of the six steps listed for using this are confusing if you do not need to use the included power adapter. The fact that those steps are optional may leave non-technical users baffled and spinning their wheels.The bottom line is in the hands of experienced folks who are familiar with hard drive nomenclature this is an invaluable tool. In fact I personally believe that every computer repair tech should have one of these sets in his or her tool kit.If the manufacturer were to take the time to develop clear and well illustrated documentation this kit would be a life saver (and a money saver) to average users who want to rescue files from a drive or to back up one. It's the documentation that is standing in way of a larger market as well as making the difference between this being a clever techie tool and a five star product.

 The price put me off and I just held it on my Wish List for 6 months until the price dropped a bit


 Still expensive, but you get what you pay for.There's a definite difference from cheaper polarizer filter I had been using in terms of the light loss
 F-stop or so better
 I haven't smeared my fingers all over it to test the claim that it is resistant to dirt and finger-prints, but I am sometimes a klutz changing filters - especially thin filters like this with a rotating part - and so far it has stayed clean and finger-print free

 I have DEFINITELY not tested how resistant it is to being stepped on, banged against things, etc


and I hope I don't have to.So far:  Good polarizing properties; better than normal polarizer at allowing light through; seems to stay clean well; easy for me to put on and remove; thin profile and light-weight; smooth, easy action.

$review_text.: I researched multiple cord reel's before I bought this one. I have it attached to the ceiling in my garage hooked into the garage opener plug.I chose the 13 Amp over the 10 Amp cords because if you are running a shop vac and a chop saw at the same time, as I do often, you will be above 10 Amps. My setup would run about 12.5 Amps in that example.I have it attached to a high ceiling and it was very easy to adjust stopper ball so in never reeled up to high for me to grab it.Cons (the reasons below are why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars)- As other reviews have stated the male plug is way to short, I could not put the reel where it made the most sense.- It does have issue retracting all the way, also stated in other reviews. Its not a huge deal, you can just push it up the rest of the way. However, I do keep 4 feet out all the time anyway since its mounted on a high garage ceiling.Overall I am happy with this purchase, if it starts falling apart in a few months I will be sure to update my review.

$review_text.: [I have posted some pictures of the product]I have two main concerns when buying wireless input devices: range and battery life.  Sure there are other concerns - I list some of them below - but if you have to sit three feet from the computer or the batteries only last a week, you're not going to be happy no matter how good the other aspects are.The Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 keyboard and mouse combo is all around a pretty nice package.  The items which I considered are below.  The primary issue with which I am not concerned is how well the mouse works on different surfaces.  My use was in my living room on a couch.  The mouse worked great on soft fabric...PROS:- Great range: Over 15 feet in my use, with many electronic devices around.  Dongle was essentially within line-of-sight, partially obstructed by other USB devices.- No "Magic Buttons": I think the wireless devices that require you to press a "Connect" button are almost gone.  Thank goodness!- Dongle size: Small - about 3 or 4 cm out from the USB port- Dongle storage: Dongle attaches to bottom of the mouse, turning off the mouse power.  Great for people taking this with their laptop.- Keyboard size: Very nearly perfect.  Full-size keyboard but not too long.  Top to bottom, the width accommodates all of the buttons and leaves a slip-resistant wrist pad at the bottom.  They accomplish this by shrinking the size of the F-keys and the shortcut keys.- Keyboard weight: Substantial enough for resting on your lap but not a burden.- Key feel: I prefer a firm keystroke; I don't even mind the old clicking keyboards.  I really dislike "mushy" keyboards.  The MS 3000 keyboard is about halfway between my rejection point and my ideal.  The keystrokes are quiet and smooth (no sticking noted) but there's a slight "divot" feel as the stroke bottoms out.  I consider this design a positive as it should satisfy most (if not quite all) keyboard users.- F-keys: programmable for other uses.  "F-lock" key forces them into standard F-key mode.- Shortcut keys:  I don't use these, and so I didn't install the software.  But I count 21 shortcut keys, plus the programmable F-keys.  With Windows Vista at least, the three volume buttons (volume up, volume down, mute) controlled the volume without the software.- Mouse size: Built for an adult's hand; not too small.- Mouse batteries: Very nice - requires only one battery, but accepts two, presumably for less-frequent changes.- Mouse buttons: Five, including the scroll-wheel.  I did not use the software, so the standard three-buttons (two plus scroll-wheel/button) were fine for me.  Scroll wheel ran smoothly without any clicking.- Mouse texture: Smooth plastic on upper-half with grip rubber below that.CONS:- Keyboard lights: No caps lock LED (most annoying), and no num-lock LED.  There's a battery LED right above the number pad, but mine did not turn on.  Perhaps it's a red one for low battery.- Key angle: Now, this is nit-picking.  The keyboard seems just a bit "flat", with the keys only slightly angled differently from each other.  Personal preference on this one.- Mouse shape: OK, maybe a positive since it's "generic".  I prefer the mice shaped for the right hand.  This one is like half an egg.Overall, I have no significant complaints with this product.  I'm not particularly fond of the mouse shape, but then it's not a deal-killer either.  The keyboard might be adjusted somewhat; but then, maybe my preferences won't work for other people.  I can't speak about the battery life, but I can say that the range is fantastic and the mouse has a nice feature by requiring only a single battery to function.Overall rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars - a great product.  Put in that caps-lock LED and maybe shape the mouse a bit and this would be an all-around 5!

$REVIEW.: I bought my first pair of these with the intention of testing out the sound quality for my home theater setup. They're really quite wonderful for anyone looking for fairly dynamic sound in a typical sized living room, and are low enough profile that they don't stick out like a sore thumb on my living room ceiling. They were easy to install, too. Though I have a fair bit of experience fishing wires through walls, so your milage my vary. I will be buying several more to complete my home audio setup.

$review_text.: Purchased to hold our new Canon T2i camera
 The camera fits great in it

 Nice and snug.The top of the case unzips and the camera goes in lens-first facing down.I was able to use the included divider pad as a protective layer to also carry our LCD Timer Battery Grip for Canon EOS 550D 600D / Rebel T2i T3i SLR Digital Camera on top of the camera.The pad has Velcro along one edge to hold it in place.It's a tight and safe fit
 You could also carry a few filters, batteries or other small accessories in the other zippable storage areas on the case.But, if you have several lenses, or other large accessories you will either need another case for those, or a different case altogether if you want to carry everything in one bag.Stap allows it to be slung over a shoulder

Can also be worn fannypack style on a belt.This one is nice if you don't want a big backpack or huge suitcase to lug around.We may outgrow this case some day, but for now it's perfect.



$review_summary.: Great case if you don't have lots of accessories.

$REVIEW.: This USB Flash Drive is very small, which makes it ideal for attaching to a keychain. Size is also important because some computer cases obstruct front USB port access for physically larger USB Flash Drives, the Cruzer Micro fits smoothly into any USB port that you can find.Speed and reliability are also excellent.The one complaint that I have about this product is that after a while the cap will begin to fall off more easily, and ultimately will be lost in a parking lot somewhere.

$review_text.: I had read quite a few reviews of this lens before buying it for my D300. Some were great and others not so great.  I picked it up to use as a portrait lens for location shoots.  I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.  Some say it's soft at f2.8.  Not mine.  Tack sharp at all focal lengths.  Some say the Autofocus is noisy(loud.)  Not mine.  Or maybe I'm just not that picky.  If noisy means you can hear it then...yeah it can be noisy.  Some say that the autofocus hunts.  Not mine.  In fact this lens focuses so fast I was amazed.  Color rendition is good.  Contrast is good.  Bokeh is nice and smooth.People raved about the Nikon 18-200vr so I bought one.  It's soft and slow in my experience.  It was "ok" on my D70 but its flaws were multiplied on my d300.  So even with the good reviews of this lens I was really worried about buying it but the price made me give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I could easily slip into another good Sigma or halfway decent Nikon lens with the money I saved over going with the Nikon equivalent.  It makes me wonder how their competitor to Nikon's 18-200vr stacks up.My only "complaint" about this lens is that the zoom ring is small, stiff, and at the base of the lens.  It's sometimes hard to get to and a bit backward from what I'm used to.  A minor annoyance is that switching to manual focus is a 2 step process.  The lens will stay in autofocus even after locking the clutch down as long as the camera is still in autofocus.  Be careful with this because you could damage your camera's motor drive if you have a tight grip on your lens. You'll know the lens is set to manual when you try to focus and the focus ring turns on its own.  I also found it odd that the lens is at it shortest when zoomed all the way in and longest when backed off to 24mm.  Strange...maybe I'm missing something here but all my other zooms are the opposite.It's big and bulky.  I actually like this because I have big hands and find it easier to stabilize heavier equipment.  And as dumb as it sounds...it looks good on the camera.  Those out of "the-know" will judge you based on these types of things at times.Nice big lens = professional right?As long as you're a potential paying customer...um...yeah! Of course!I haven't had a chance to try it out yet but I've heard some people complain about lens flare and that hood is useless to protect against it.  I like lens flare and use it creatively in my own photography so it's not anything I would consider a minus. For me a lens hood is something I use to keep from bumping the end of my lens into stuff.  I can see though how people could get annoyed if it's unexpected.  But if you're getting unexpected flare in your shots you're not doing your job as a photographer and paying proper attention to your scene.Update 6/17/2008I've been shooting with this lens for a few weeks now and my above observations are accurate.  However the lens flare issue is a bit more than I thought.  I had a hard time getting the "touch of flair" I like in some backlit shots.  It was more like "holy crap that's a lot of flair!"  The hood does seem a bit useless but I tend to bump into stuff so it's good to protect the end of the lens.  I'd still buy it and fully recommend it at 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: The &amp;#34;interface&amp;#34; reminds me of one of the early digital cameras. The threw away the UI &amp;#34;book&amp;#34; and created a unique interface, poorly. It's clunky and feels really cheap. I ordered the recommended 4GB card and loaded a bunch of JPGs on it. It would not display any of the pics. I put the same pics on a USB flash drive and it showed a few, with some fiddling. I'm pretty sure I'm going to send this thing back and try something different. The instructions are totally useless. They offer no help on how to format pictures (if that's even the issue) not does it give any specs on what kind of storage devices are compatible. I'm pretty sure the &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; card isn't compatible. Who knows, though? Maybe it's my pictures that are incompatible. Since there's no way to know, and there's no way I'm calling tech support for a picture frame, and since there are endless other options, opting for a return seems like the best idea. Don't buy this thing.

$REVIEW.: Only issue is the zippers.  The light fabric sseems to get stuck much like the zipper on a cheap sleeping bag.  The light material folds over ahd gets caught in the zipper.  With some care this doesn't happen but it is a bit frustraing since many zippers found a way around this with shields and curves.  It is black, double walled and keeps the light out though which is its main purpose and it is large enough for a couple 35mm development cans each with two stainless reels inside. Finally, it isn't too expensive.  Just wish they had better zippers.

Enabling the Trim function as described on various Mint/Ubuntu websites went without a hitch.  I've enabled a few other basic tweaks and they also have worked without any problems. Be sure to use the the EXT4 file system when partitioning, Linux Mint 13 uses it by default.  Do not use the Linux Mint 13 KDE release, not even Orkin could kill all the bugs on that turkey.At this point I am using the swap partition and browser caching on the SSD, but will be moving those to RAM as soon as Amazon gets my memory delivered to bump my computer up to 4gb.  A note to other Dell GX620 owners.  The Normal mode in the BIOS is in fact AHCI mode, as such it does fully support the Trim function.  Linux can also emulate the Trim function using CRON if you do not have an AHCI capable box.I'm telling you all this because getting the information to determine whether an SSD would work on my computer was like pulling teeth. User Name "SpeedStep" on the Dell forums was a lot of help.Buy an SSD, you'll like it.  Unless your Mac or an XP user, it isn't that big a deal.

Kudos to Sony to make this item work for the NEX-system cameras as well as for the Alpha system cameras.One inserts the "battery w/connector" where you normally insert your battery. A small wire which leads to the larger transformer and ac cord, juts out of the battery compartment which is secured by the sliding tab. Cables are heavy duty which one prefers around the studio.The only negative was that I could not switch off "Power Save" on the Nex-5n. The maximum time I could choose was 30 minutes before the camera went into sleep mode.

$review_text.: [edited 4/09/06 for some final thoughts]This review is based on over six months of daily use and two road trips through much of the western USA and Canada.First, this software with the Holux GPSlim 236 is what I should have bought. The Tomtom GPS receiver is pretty, but the necessity of switching it on each time you use it (rather than it coming on with external power) has made it a pain to own and I'm going to toss it in a drawer or donate it to a GPSless friend.I use a Dell Axim X51v, so performance is not an issue, even on thousand mile routes the initial route calculation only takes a few seconds.Installation. The installation was simple and trouble free. I had heard that getting the product registered might be an issue but as soon as I connected my PDA to the internet and entered the key I got authorized. I guess the individual state maps are on the rest of the CDs, I only needed the installation and the first two map CDs. For myself I'd rather this had been on a DVD. By comparison iGuidance Europe, which is on a DVD, took two trips to the Internet to search for help and quite a bit of messing with the Bluetooth connection before it could see the receiver.Connecting. If the application is started whilst Bluetooth is disabled on the PDA it simply enables it and connects. Other than waiting a few seconds there has never been an issue with the Bluetooth initerface. If you need to pair it the code is 0000. If you need to use a different GPS then tap the screen, hit "change preferences" then three right arrows and then "show GPS status". Hit the "Configure", use the arrows to select the right hardware and hit Select. Easy. In iGuidance I had to add the receiver as an 'outgoing' serial connection and then tell it which com port had been assigned.The hardware works reasonably well, the Bluetooth receiver has mostly locked on fast and stayed locked everywhere except inside tunnels and a ferry, and even there it managed to receive a couple of satellites (how?). Twice the lock on has taken more than ten minutes, I have no clue why, the satellite display showed around eight good signals but it just didn't lock on. A selling point of the hardware is that it shuts off if the Bluetooth link is down for more than a few minutes. That is sensible, no point running the battery down. But there's a down side, if you want to put the receiver somewhere where it can get a good signal, like on the rear parcel shelf and plugged into a power socket in the trunk, then you'd rather not have to climb in the back each time you get in the car to switch on the receiver. In the long run this may be a killer for me, units like the Holux GPSlim236 can be plugged in and forgotten, they can also take an external antenna which the Tomtom can't... though to be fair it shows no sign of needing it either, in the middle of the first floor of a 300' wide multi floor parking structure it still locked onto six satellites.The 3D and normal map displays are both useful, however the zoom controls only last a few seconds and then the map returns to showing only a small section of road ahead. The zoom seems to be controlled partially by proximity to your next turn and partly by local road details, so in urban areas you get about a quarter of a mile. Perhaps they did this for safety, but in that case they shouldn't have provided the controls. In cities this is ok but when you are driving around rural areas it doesn't let you see the area around you, so you can't see if your route is sensible. I have taken to using the browse map view and then moving it as I drive in rural areas. I should be able to zoom the display until it shows a level of detail that is useful to me and it should stay there. When zoomed out the map display does continue to show useful detail, iGuidance drops too many map features and if you are on small remote roads can leave you looking at a blank screen.There are many choices for map colors and it's easy to get day and night color schemes that give good contrast and visibility. You can also choose from several clear male and female voice options, in English these include US, English and Australian accents. Terminology tracks accent, so if you choose English English you get motorways instead of freeways; amusing but not a problem.The text at the bottom of the screen can show the next turn, speed, distance to go, current time, time to go and eta. The choices are configurable, but nothing like the twenty or thirty that Garmin allowed you to choose from six years ago. The text is very small, I have good eyes and I really have to look hard to see the figures. If I'm 400 miles from my next turn I need to know that a lot more than I need to know I'm going to be turning left when I get there. For this sort of price it should be possible to have more control of the information displayed. iGuidance shows even less information and gives you less control. But this is another case where Garmin had a better solution six years ago.Touching the lower right corner brings up the overview of the route, this should have pan/zoom controls and be in the day/night color scheme. For a trip of several hundred miles it's hardly possile to make out the route on the full VGA display of the X51v.The options for finding a destination are easy to use, the ones I have needed were address, city center, POI and point on map. The routing is also non-volatile, so you can stop for the night and resume in the morning.  One strange thing is that the previous destinations are stored per map, so if you route to a city on the major roads map and then switch to a more detailed map the destination isn't on the list of recent destinations. The unit exhibits a common problem to north american products, you can't route between countries, you can't ask for a route from Calgary Alberta to Salt Lake City Utah because there isn't a map that has both cities. If you want to route from Bute Montana to Idaho Falls Idaho you have to use the major roads map because the states are on different major maps, west and plains. Worth bearing in mind if you live on a border.Trip time predictions are very poor. For a trip from Alameda CA to Port Angeles WA the initial prediction was around 18 hours, which means they are using an average speed of around 50mph. That may be reasonable for I880 on a Monday at 9am but it's 50% out for I5 in northern california. The actual duration was about 14 hours including stops for food and fuel and a visit to Hertz in Portland, OR. On smaller roads the errors are much larger. For the Nephi UT to Tonopah, NV the predicted time was over eight hours and the actual trip time was just over four. On major rural roads in Canada with a 60mph limit the trip times appear to be based on a 30mph average.Routing is fast and the suggested route is certainly in the right direction, but there are issues related to poor choices of road speeds. The software works out the time taken for various routes based on the average speeds for those road classes, but the low freway and major road settings lead it to choose apparently shorter routes through urban areas, this means that it avoids fast roads like US101. In Calgary it routed my south for miles on city streets when I was only half a mile from Deerfoot Trail which is a 65mph road with no stop lights and ultimately becomes I15 at the border. There are also minor weirdnesses, on my daily commute I take I880 south from Oakland CA to San Jose CA, at I238 it directs me to take the off ramp, then then on ramp back to I880. Strangely, if you start from a different place it is able to route you straight down I880 without detouring to the off ramp. Mostly the routes aren't bad though, but Garmin did it better five years ago.Rerouting: If you ask for an alternate route it seeks an alternate for all of the route. So if you are going from Oakland, CA to Seattle, WA and get stuck in traffic trying to get to the freeway and ask for another route it will not only change the entrance onto the freeway, it will also reroute the rest of the trip, so instead of a long day on I5 you may find yourself on a three day drive up the coast. The simple solution is to divert until you are past the problem and then to resubmit the original destination.There are some major mapping errors, much of the time in Canada and Montana the mapped road position was tens or even hundreds of yards from the actual position. This causes the software to either show you driving through open fields near the road, or down the wrong side of a freeway, or even down the frontage road hundreds of yards away on the far side of the freeway in Banff national park. This causes some strange voice directions too, like "turn around when possible" when you are driving down I15 at 70mph and have been going the right way for hours and have to keep going straight ahead for hours. Most city streets in the US are spot on though. But the maps do seem to be 2-4 years out of date.POI problems. The POI list is very lacking. Maybe half to two thirds of gas stations are missing. But worse is the method of selecting POIs. You can look up stores by name, but in the case of the major chains you can get quite a few hits. In places like the San Francisco Bay Area there's a world of difference between somewhere 11 miles down I880 and ten miles across the bay, the first is a 22 mile round trip and the second could be 70. All you get is a list of stores with distances, no address, no direction. So you can't tell which 15 mile distant place they are in. If you select the wrong one and thereby discover that you need to drive thirty miles and cross a toll bridge to get there then there's no back button, you have to go through the whole POI selection process again. This is a method that is not yet ready for the real world. It took me a good ten minutes to discover that the POI list didn't know about the particular version of the store that I thought it should know, I guess I didn't really need it, but then I'm not always in my own back yard. Garmin gives the address and direction of POIs before you commit to one.The map accuracy and POI list needs a lot of work.Only the main map display follows the day/night color scheme, the route map and browsable maps remain in their standard eye wateringly bright colors. A brightness control would be more useful than night colors, but to get to that you have to go to the PDA settings, not something I feel like doing whilst driving.At the end of November '05 Tomtom released Navigator version 5.21 for Windows Mobile 5. The behavior of the system has certainly changed. The most noticeable thing is that it now strongly prefers the shortest route in many situations. Unfortunately that means that it will now route me on surface streets rather than the adjacent interstate. For example Alameda to Emeryville can be achieved almost exclusively at 60mph+ on I880, I980, I580 and I80 and yet the new version chooses the surface streets at 25mph with lights every block. I suppose it can't be expected to know that the route it chooses goes through West Oakland which has more murders than most European countries. In the Mojave and Death Valley it often routed me down dirt roads when there was a decent highway nearby. Whether it's the map data or the routing, they need to know that a trail formed by a bulldozer driving through the desert isn't the same thing as a metaled road.I have contacted Tomtom customer support about the ludicrous average speeds, however they have not contacted me in a month, much less the 24 hours they promissed. Neither Tomtom not Teleatlas have given any sort of response to my eight map error reports, if I am going to all that trouble to accurately describe their errors the least they can do is acknowledge that they have received them, right now I don't know if they are dropping them in the round filling cabinet.After more research I have found many reports of Tele-Atlas inaccuracies (in the UK, for example, major towns missing and impossible directions at some of the bussiest interchanges in the country, like the M4-M25 near Heathrow airport, which may well be the first interchange many foreigners meet in the UK) and even major cities missing from the database.Compared to iNavigator 2.1.2 Europe: Tomtom update rates are faster, the maps are drawn better, the voice prompts are timed and spaced better. Tomtom shows more useful data than iNavigator, though still not near the standard of old Garmin dedicated units.  iNavigator Europe has some serious usability issues related to windows-style menus covering up essential controls like the map zoom and exit buttons. The zoom control on iNavigator is persistant, but not available as often and is very difficult to use whilst driving (on Tomtom the top corners zoom out and in, on iNavigator it's a tiny little control at the bottom center).  It may not be fair to compare the US Tomtom (Teleatlas) maps to the European iNavigator (Navtech) maps, but they are about comparable. Both have their issues but will still get you there in the end.On balance still a good product, however I am becoming concerned that the hype of the advertising campaigns isn't matched by world class technical teams. It took more than a month to answer the first support question with "sorry, no". But to be fair, most of it works well. And it is very pretty. Overall I haven't seen a better solution.Around two months after I asked some fairly pointed questions, on their web site, I just received three emails saying that I must update my questions to indicate that I still required support or they would close them if I did not respond in 48 hours. So I did. In each case I commented "yes I still want you to answer my question". That's an interesting technique for clearing your tech support backlog, but it does nothing for your customers. I'm starting to think that all they want is your money and they don't care whether they, or their product, does a good job.Despite my response they closed the calls 48 hours later. Not good.I did finally get some answers from support. You can buy the European maps on-line for a very reasonable price. They don't have any solution for the GPS receiver powering off when it loses bluetooth comms and they don't see it as an issue.I'm looking forward to a software upgrade which I hear should come out soon. I'll update this review when it does.

$review_text.: The Belkin Fuse Folio case allows you to adjust the viewing angles for optimal viewing and or typing.  It works well in that regard, but has an issue accessing the power and volume buttons.To insert the Galaxy Tab into the Fuse, you slide it into a sleeve, then fold a flap over and in to the sleeve.  Think of an envelope.  It works well at keeping the Galaxy Tab secure and gives you easy access to most ports, including the charging port.  The problem is that because the material surrounding the cutout for the power and volume buttons is too loose, the buttons are recessed underneath the cutout.  It makes it difficult to use those buttons.The exterior fabric is a grippy material that works well for a good grip, but I personally don't like how it looks.  A long elastic band keeps the cover shut when not in use.The Belkin Fuse folio case is a nice case overall, but the problems with button access keeps me from recommending it.

$review_text.: The audio quality, battery life, and ease of use are great on this player
 However, I hoped to use it in my car with the optional cradle unit + remote via the line out jack


 While it does work, I am unable to run the unit on the cars power due to it going into PC Connected mode when I plug the cradle's USB cord into my USB to Car power adaptor

 I am forced to run its batteries down and then wait for it to completely charge before it can be used again

 If the batteries are not completely worn down to the point where the unit won't turn on it will not charge in my car
 I have to plug it into my PC to charge.If you plan on just using this as a standalone unit it is excellent
 Only when used with the optional cradle + remote package does it seem to fail my expectations.

Great reception - much better than my FM radio.  Very good sound for a little device.

Amazon lists it at about $135 today. I received it a little over 1 month ago and I believe it was $25 higher, but also a bargain. I drove 3500 miles on vacation the last 3 weeks and used the Garmin almost all of the time.. The Garmin was easy to use with rapid start and programming. A couple of times it took what I consider a bad route, but all you have to do is drive what you think is better and it will rapidly recalculate and keep you on track. The recalculation is even more valuable if you get lost as the recalculation feature combined with a destination will probably get you back on path rapidly.The display was quite good, the information very helpful. You can find out the route in advance with a push on the screen. Estimated time of arrival is listed and revised after a pit stop. I have some problem seeing my car speedometer in some lighting situation, but the gps guided speedometer on the Garmin is great. You want to go home? Click on home. It remembers quite a few recent destinations as well. Points of interest including motel, service stations and restaurants are easily available.The audio voice is pleasant. Like other GPS you are told to turn right or keft, but this Garmin tells you the name of the street for which you are making the turn.I did not use the blue tooth feature as my car already has built in blue tooth.My prior car had a navigation system with a larger map, but was less convenient and required taking your eyes way off the road to see the screen, which was too low in position.  I used a friction-bean bag mount for the Garmin and placed it near my line of sight immediately below the front window line. It is very easy to glance at without departing the road.

$review_text.: Great quality, simple, yet effective holder for your TV not to be tipped off. All hardware included. Worth the $15 without a doubt. Very strong - you just need to mount it into the stud in your wall or with good enough hardware holders if you don't have an option for solid studs in your walls. It's designed to fit perfectly with a Sanus furniture but you can accommodate it with any furniture or if it's not possible - just drill both holes in your wall and fix it that way. I did it for extra stability. I'm very happy with this belt and highly recommend it.

Simply gorgeous &amp; very easy to install, just tedious that's that

Fitment's very good


Don't freak out if the wrap around edge pieces won't stick at first
Do everything else THEN use the blow dryer for those pieces that won't stick


Only issue I had was when I was taking off (then re-installing) the area around the trackpad, the thin strip tore in half right above the trackpad but you can barely see it
Price isn't too bad especially since I don't have anything else to compare it too
I must've taken it off 5-7 times before getting it right yet it still clings on


I waited 2-days before using it to be on the safe side
I've heard customer service for the lifetime warranty's good so hope it's that way if I ever have issues
Overall, I'd rate it a 4.5 mainly due to the fact it's very tedious to install.BTW, there's no need to use the included spray (not sure why they included this) since it's just for the screen protector.

Also, a quick word about video and transfer rates.  Digital video is recorded in "megaBITS" per second, while these cards are speed rated in "megaBYTES" per second.  That makes it a bit confusing.  At the moment, digital SLRs from the factory are at about 24 up to 100 megabits/second in terms of their video rate.  To convert bits to bytes, divide by 8...so that becomes 3 MB/sec to 12.5 MB/second.  For most digital SLRs out there, even the Sandisk Ultra is fast enough for video, but if your camera has a high bitrate option, this Sony has enough headroom for sustained file writing.  The Sandisks are still king of the mountain, but they do cost more.  Sandisk has long underrated their higher end cards; even older Sandisks are often faster than newer cards from other makers (like the older compact flash example above).  If you absolutely need the higher performance, go with the Sandisk Extreme or Extreme Pro, but you'll pay for it.  From my own numbers, I'm comfortable with the Sony for day to day use for my D800.  If I really need speed though, I'm going with compact flash over SDHC.</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A294LX6WPWH2EP"><latest_review_date>20/11/2008</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B001GQ2W6W</product_id><review_date>20/11/2008</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 1]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Finally</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A294PZH5BPG8UE"><latest_review_date>21/12/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00BYRPM9M</product_id><review_date>21/12/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Works in my laptop</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A295VPW9H9BB8X"><latest_review_date>10/04/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00065DH04</product_id><review_date>10/04/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>I absolutely love this and the fact it can get Netflix is even better!Of course the con is that each speaker as two wires to plug into the back of clamp holes.

The packaging is neat and professional, it includes a screwdriver (so you don't have to dig around to find one for the small mounting screws) and a manual, though it's pretty straight forward.Not much else to say - which is a good thing when you're describing a hard drive enclosure

.this time FRUITLESS!I spent over 30 minutes with customer service and they refused to acknowledge that the following problem is with the TV
I have a new camera that shoots HD (1080P) video and audio


It has standard HDMI output


There are no settings on the camera to change the type of HDMI output, it is just HDMI industry standard
I connect a HDMI cable to the camera and attach to our VIZIO 22" TV or a friend's Samsung HDTV and the video and audio play perfectly


I attach the same camera, and the same cable, to this XVT373SV and the video plays fine, but no audio


I have tried all the HDMI inputs, even the one through which a Blu-ray was playing seconds before and the VIZIO plays no audio
I've cold booted the TV and they confirmed I have the last Firmware update installed.I called VIZIO Customer support, worked with them for over 30 minutes and they blamed the problem totally on the camera

They said that I needed to get into the camera settings and change the output to something different to get the 373 to play it

There are NO tweaks in the camera that can be changed to something different to accomodate the 373's technical problem
Yet, VIZIO insists the problem is the fault of the camera and that I need to contact the manufacturer and find out how to change, hack, or tweak it's output to meet the needs of the 373
Of course that might then make the camera incompatible with other fully compatible and capable displays, including VIZIO's own models."Alice in South Dakota, Badge 547" refused to escalate the incident and said there was nothing VIZIO could do to assist me
It will be interesting to see what the camera manufacturer has to say, consindering they are one of the two finest names in their field!My new "Motto" suggestion for VIZIO is "Not My Fault." I am updating the rating I gave them in several related areas after this latest encounter.I would certainly NEVER acquire this VIZIO model used or in the obsolete model market

I also would recommend avoiding VIZIO products having seen how much time it requires to get them to step up to their responsibilities
And then there are the times when they just walk away from addressing an issue.======Following is the earlier review, but yo may have already heard enough about VIZIO products=======NOTE: Numerous UPDATES regarding issues with this model have been moved to the end of this extensive owner experience review.Apologies that the review is long, but it is based on an informed evaluation
If you want something quick and dirty, look elsewhere


You'll find LOTs out there :-) I already know some people have benefited from what I share, especially those to whom this is a major investment and they want to make an informed choice

Of course this is history now, since the 373 seems to have come and gone now


However, I do see that some on the annoying problems of this unit are shared in a variety of VIZIO displays of varying sizes

Some of the areas of concern relative to features and vendor reliability will be of value in future purchases.I don't do comparison reviews or make recommendations since my reviews are in depth of products with which I have extensive experience


I'm NOT a review wonk


Finally, I ended up keeping this model because VIZIO finally provided a new replacement that didn't have the HDMI scrambling problem


No other brand 37" unit was available that would fit in the custom cabinetry

The picture is excellent even if the user interface is poorly designed and executed

My "star" ratings have been updated to reflect the final evaluation
Vendor Service for VIZIO rates two stars.=================I did not purchase this TV from Amazon but from another online retailer


This TV was top choice for me in a situation where I had to have a device that would fit inside an existing piece of furniture
In the size aspect, this TV rates a "10" for my needs

It fits in a cabinet with an 1/8th to spare on either side! The picture is very good and the overall look is clean
Thin was no big deal for me, but this one rates high in that area.I am writing this review to cover some of the aspects of the XVT373SV 37" RazorLED LCD HDTV (coming from the perspective of an ex-electronics tech and someone very familiar with electronics and user interface capabilities) to give others a balanced idea of overall quality and performance relative to your needs

I have seen a variety of commercial reviews (not comments here) that I think reprint boilerplate and are not based on actual use over time
In many ways this is a good TV, however at the typical price point it is hardly up to snuff when it comes to day to day use by people who read the manual and know the difference between a mediocre picture and one that is set-up properly.Over-the-air HDTV is very good with an appropriate antenna

However, changing channels is a very SLOOOOW process


Maybe that is true with all modern HDTVs with this feature set?The User Interface is horrible in multiple areas

This is very troubling as it is probably the easiest thing to do right since there are good interfaces out there and, theoretically, if can be fixed through a firmware upgrade
It has not been as of Version 3.nnn of the firmware

Next to actually watching something on the unit, the User Interface is where you will spend the largest amount of time

Expect to spend even more time in the VIZIO RazorLED interface unless VIZIO decides to fix numerous problems in the interface design
Here are a couple highlights, or lowlights:Our smaller two year old VIZIO can easily change the screen aspect ratio (Normal, Zoom, etc.) but with the XVT373SV you have to go into the menu system, highlight the option and then choose the correct display


And you are doing with a display reduced in size in some weird manner so until you exit the menu completely you are never certain if you have the correct setting or not
Really annoying, inferior design even compared to older and cheaper VIZIO products

Here is to hoping for a fix in a firmware update


It wasn't in the latest 3.0nnn version, but the startup on-screen logo has changed!Making picture adjustments is incredibly difficult for these times


It is amazing how deep VIZIO's crack software usability team has buried key settings regarding the picture
Those adjustments (color, frame rate, "motion enhancement" etc.) are buried several levels deeper in the user interface than the display aspect ratio settings.AMAZING: Having pressed the MENU button it requires 16 key presses to just get to the listing of items to adjust the picture! If the family wants to watch a movie you will learn to start the movie and do the setup ahead of time to avoid having a very early intermission.Note that this 120 Hz unit can display the "Soap Opera Effect" to a very high degree
(Google it if you don't know what it is.) You'll be watching a superb film but it looks like a much lower-budget, less artistic, video production


You will need to go on a journey through the Advance Picture settings and, from what I have been able to test, make sure the "Smooth Motion Effect" is turned off


I hope that someday more info will be available about "Real Cinema Mode" (see below) and Film Mode.Changing the INPUT is, thankfully, directly accessible from a button on the remote

Why not the display mode? Maybe even an assignable button or two is called for on this "Premium" remote?VIZIO has located Setup options access in two radically different places
One is through the remote's Menu button and another is found in the VIA Dock, the docking menu that appears when you hit the VIA logo button in the middle of the remote.Confession time, I am a manual reader

I want to get the most from any high technology device and I've also written technical documentation for end-users
Just where you need it most, the manual contains virtually "information-free" verbiage


I see the "Real Cinema Mode" option and want to know why I might use it or what it does or how to set it up

Here is what VIZIO shares in the manual: "The Real Cinema Mode option allows selection of the type of compensation used for the Smooth MotionTM Effect option


Choose from Off, Precision and Smooth." Gee, thanks for clearing that up! It is almost as though the writer could not find anyone who knew what the darn thing does
I printed an extra copy of the manual just to make reminder notes!Bugs???Shortly after getting the TV we added a new Sony Blu-ray


When the Blu-ray and the TV and turned on and I play a DVD or Blu-ray the TV displays a horrible scrambling of the video

This is in 1080P mode

The audio also cuts out in the worst of the scrambling


Thinking the issue was with the Blu-ray (after swapping out the Sony HMDI cable with a higher quality one and also trying different HMDI inputs) I exchanged for a different Sony of the same model but a couple months newer manufacture


To my surprise the problem continued
The VIZIO has NEVER exhibited this problem with any input other than the Sony Blu-ray

I'm left to believe it is a compatibility issue between this model Sony Blu-ray or one of the settings for output and something in the VIZIO


The strangest part is that the problem fades in 3 to 6 minutes and DOES NOT RETURN as long as everything is running
It may be some sort of heat related issue in the VIZIO circuitry.UPDATE: This turned out to be a unit defect, experienced by many others
Eventually VIZIO did swap out this defective unit for a new unit.Feature confusion:Although it is possible to dig deep enough (which I did before making the purchase) material on the VIZIO XVT373SV HDTV, including information on VIZIO's specific product website, is confusing in stating that this unit has smart dimming to enhance black levels


It DOES NOT have local dimming

Local dimming is not supported by the edge lit design in the smaller size units like my 37"


The larger models in this RazorLED series do appear to support actual local dimming to further enhance the black levels


On my unit we found the way VIZIO implemented dimming to be annoying and distracting
The only time it seemed to do much was in a full screen credit roll at the end of a Blu-ray movie


In parts where a major credit would leave the screen before the next one appeared the TV would have a little pause, then the backlight would virtually go off and a  second later as the next credit appeared the screen would suddenly flash to life making the black level very evident

Since this unit has respectable black levels we just turned that "feature" off


I have seen real local dimming in action and it is a unique way to achieve amazing dynamic range.The USB ports did NOTHING in the first release

One of the later software releases finally sees thumb drives with images and will do a rudimentary slide show

When you end the show it is necessary to unplug and replug the USB drive to see it seen again.The VIA applications (again as of firmware V 3.nnn) are incredibly lame in comparison to a Sony Blu-ray player we were given at Christmas

Having Netflix is nice, especially with the way media content is evolving


The Sony Blu-ray has almost as many CATEGORIES in Internet accessed content as VIA has in individual sources


I haven't counted this but I would estimate that the Sony Internet content interface has 20 to 40 TIMES as many content sources as VIA.Annoyances and quirks:Especially for one that is ballyhooed as a "Premium Remote," the design is only mediocre
The button locations and assignments continually evade me, but maybe that is an individual issue.One nice feature is that you can assign a remote to a specific input and the VIZIO remote will automatically be able to control some basic functions on your Blu-ray, DVD or even Xbox

Why they call this function Device Setup instead of Remote setup is another usability annoyance


Unfortunately, the functionality seems to have been very poorly thought out
I set the VIZIO remote up to control our disc player
When I switched the TV to the disc input it was no longer possible to access the menu of the TV! The MENU button on the VIZIO remote, needed to change almost anything in the screen, video or audio settings, instead made the DVD's Menu pop up for the disc in play! It was IMPOSSIBLE to access the VIZIO TV's menu to change screen aspect ratio or any of the needed settings for various discs! Oops VIZIO! Since the various settings are tied to the input mode, it was not possible to just go to another input, make the change, and return

It was necessary to switch to a different Input, then go to Device Setup for all the inputs and disable it for the disc player! This function is basically unusable

VIZIO does now have a workaround but it makes getting to the TV menu even more cumbersome.Inputs can have custom labels assigned


I do wish they could be longer than 10 characters

There is more than enough room on screen even though the "generic" title of the input continues to appear also.The Auto channel scan seems OK
I do wish I could have a setting there to choose to only include digital (or analog) channels

There is a partial channel search that allows this functionality, BUT it leaves in channels that we previously found and have changes

Being able to receive over-the-air HDTV from both Chicago and Milwaukee it means a lot of rescanning as new channels are always going on line and there has been a lot of shuffling
I'd like a feature to delete all channels and run a selective scan.The remote has a slide out QWERTY keyboard, but it too is mediocre
Most things you do with the keyboard will also require you to go back to the main remote so it really isn't all that convenient
I live by a Smartphone and the keyboard is far inferior, even though 2 to 3 times larger, than any Smartphone I've used


My current small BlackBerry keyboard is far superior to actually type something in.So, at the current version of the updated firmware I would have to say, keeping in mind the typical price point, that this TV is technically average, perhaps above average, but the User interface, access to functionality, and content of the documentation is sadly lacking or flawed
With some major changes, especially through the firmware, this TV could be "a contender."UPDATES CONCERNING UNIT DEFECTS:UPDATE 2011-01-26: A new wrinkle appeared today as VIZIO Technical support finally confirmed (after quite some time testing, re-birthing/resetting my TV to factory defaults and confirming it had the latest firmware) that the problem with Blu-ray distortion is a defect in this VIZIO TV


Three Blu-ray player exchanges later, multiple cable brand tests, and testing of all the HDMI inputs and disconnecting of all other devices



.it is a problem with a defective VIZIO TV
[A sequence of images showing the problem have been added to the webpage

Click on "View and share related images" below the picture of the VIZIO XVT373SV]Even though this new set is now confirmed defective by VIZIO the most VIZIO will do is "send out a repair person for in-home repair."I told the VIZIO customer service person that I would be much more comfortable with an exchange, even refurbished, than having a the repair person visit and work on repairing it

There was absolutely no willingness on the part of VIZIO to provide customer satisfaction when a lengthy problem turned out to be caused by their defective VIZIO product
That's not what I expected from a company that BRANDS themselves as, "America's Number One Hi-Def TV Company" and "The Home of Entertainment Freedom for All." Maybe that's the difference between "Branding" a company and "Building" a company? To me "Home Entertainment Freedom" now means that in the future be smarter to try a different vendor.I reduced this VIZIO's rating to 1 STAR based on VIZIO's support in correcting this issue.I told the VIZIO Agent I wanted to follow up with Sam's Club On-line before setting up a repair appointment

NO service tech, how qualified or trained, will have access to the resources available when a set is truly "refurbished" and tested at a vendor authorized facility.To me it was paying the "brand spanking new price" for a set but ending up with a repaired unit inferior to a refurbished one!I called Sam's On-line and their customer service didn't hesitate to begin an exchange for a new unit of the same model


I'm impressed that Sam's Club is covering for a failure of VIZIO to deliver Customer Satisfaction


I hope Sam's makes VIZIO pay for their dropping the ball!UPDATE 2011-02-12: A replacement XVT373SV arrived, provided by VIZIO

VIZIO decided than an exchange for a new unit was justified

BTW, I was still waiting for SAM's Online to follow through with their promise when VIZIO contacted me by phone.After a day of testing the replacement from VIZIO does not exhibit the HDMI signal distortion that the first TV does

If you want to see the annotated screenshots of the problem click on "View and share related images" below the picture of the VIZIO XVT373SV


I also plugged a thumbdrive with JPG images on it in one of the USB ports and after a while the TV reported it had found a content source connected to the USB port and presented a menu where I could play the content

The slide show worked fine
Last time I tried this the previous TV didn't ever respond to the insertion of a thumbdrive.

$REVIEW.: We had an older Philips docking speaker that we enjoyed but had issues with - the stand broke off after only a month.  It didn't hold a charge as well as we would have liked, and after a while the ipod started falling forward.I held off reviewing this for a while to make sure that none of the same problems occurring with this version.  The look of this portable speaker is far sleeker and much more attractive.  I love the look of the speaker, it's slimmer than our previous one.  The stand is far sturdier and has yet to break after several months of use.  Also the cover on the speaker has kept it cleaner than our other one.The sound is fantastic for such a small speaker and it works well with both our I-pods and I-phones - we don't have an I-pad to try it with but it appears that at least the smaller I-Pads would work fine.For the price and the size the sound and durability are all I could ask for.  This has been used to listen to music in the garage, back yard, shower and has been taken to work for listening to audiobooks.

$REVIEW.: Purchased last December to upgrade the Canon 17-85mm IS "kit lens" that came with my 20D.  Careful testing showed this new lens to be about "one-stop sharper" over the 17-35mm range than the kit lens.  What I mean by this is that the 17-55 matched the 17-85 sharpness with one stop faster aperture: same sharpness at f2.8 for 17mm as the 17-85 at f4.0.  Beyond 35mm the sharpness of the 17-55 faded until both lenses were essentially equal in sharpness at 55mm.  The 17-55 was noticibly softer at 55mm than at 17mm while the 17-85 was  sharper at 55mm than at 17mm.  So, the advantage of f2.8 and better sharpness at the wide end for the 17-55 is at least partially negated by diminished sharpness at the meager 55mm long end.  The 17-85 has about the same build quality but is smaller, lighter, covers a longer focal length range and for me is a better deal at about half the price.

It does a good job of protecting the Macbooks wrist pad which is prone to cracking on the front, but I have ordered the Moshi pad guard instead. Although the Moshi does not protect the keys from dust or spills it will protect the wrist pad from the cracking issue that all white Macbooks suffer. If you have this generation of Macbook I would urge you to get some protection for it, either this skin if you can tolerate it or the Moshi, as your precious Mac will eventually crack due to opening and closing.

$review_text.: We have gone through many, many types of DVD/Blue Ray storage cases and this by far is the BEST!Best feature: the ability to see each DVD Individually without looking at a list (which most of the other models you can not see each disc. You don't realize how important it is until you can't see the disc)Only small complaint: the individual disc holders are a bit flimsy but do the job. They need to redesign with better material. Maybe a hard plastic.Highly recommend and a must for hard core Movie Buffs.

$REVIEW.: For the low cost of this Ball Head, it can't be beat. I bought it specifically for my Manfrotto MM294A4 monopod and I couldn't be happier. I needed a head mainly so I could do portraiture shooting on the monopod (was using a 3/8&amp;#34; to 1/4&amp;#34; adapter prior with no head). The ball works perfectly.A couple bonus items that I wasn't aware of when I bought this, but have since found:-The quick release lever does have a locking pin to make sure the lever doesn't come lose. Twist the pin clockwise and it's lock. Counterclockwise and the lever is free to release.-The head has a pan function. There is onl one release knob that controls both the pan function and the ball, but the pan works well. Not exactly the smoothest cation around, so not great for video, but good for still photography. Overall, I'm very happy with the head... especially for under </review_text><review_summary>eh...</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A29TUXCNBS8IT5"><latest_review_date>18/07/2011</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00DSUTVK4</product_id><review_date>18/07/2011</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>Not much to say a b o u t  t h e s e. e x c e p t.

$REVIEW.: I bought these knowing they weren't a great substitute for a macro lens, but are pretty damn good

I posted the photo of a water drop on the feather with a purple glitter background


That picture was taken using all four of these filters stacked
I did not crop the image whatsoever, only adjusted the coloring some

I really enjoy these just be careful about fingerprints because they are a pain the booty to clean
I spent an hour last week cleaning these bad boys before I could even put them away


THe smallest smudge or piece of lint also gets magnified

Definitely worth trying out for how inexpensive they are.

They happily pick up the phone and answer any questions you may have.Pro:The main reason I chose this unit is because of the slim profile. I think its great.The biggest pro is the built in cable. It is very convenient while traveling.Con:The built in cable could be a millimeter longer, its a little bit of a tight fit snapping back into the body.The material could be a little softer. Ideally it would be made of soft plastic.

Fantastic. Clearly better range for non-ac clients. The previous wireless router was a Netgear WNDR 3800 dual band gigabit, which has generally been reliable. However, several sections of my house were very poorly covered with the r3800. Now, no problem. Crazy good stuff. This range improvement alone makes the purchase well worth it to me. It could be the better antennae (3 of them) but it's possible their &amp;#34;Beamforming+&amp;#34; technique works. (A good test would be if you could temporarily disable the beamforming function)Note: It is unlikely that the router will support large numbers of beamforming clients simultaneously (12?), and it is probable that non-beamforming clients will fall into radio &amp;#34;shadows&amp;#34; outside the &amp;#34;beams&amp;#34;. At the moment (early morning) the device is reporting only 8 wireless clients. All only using the 2.4GHz band.I'm also happy that I can disable WPS.Caveats: At the moment I'm only using this as a wireless access point. I have not configured it yet to replace the older router it is behind, so many router functions and extras are not in play. Also, I have only had it on and running for 2 days. I will update this review when I re-configure my network and start using it's full router capabilities.

$review_text.: I bought this a while back and finally installed it...I'm impressed. This small antenna rocks. I have a satellite system and wanted an antenna to get the locals during the occasional outage so I gave it a shot.Assembly was simple, and I had a spare coax running to my set so I got in the attic, cut the cable, added a connector, hooked her up and hung it from a nail. Best over the air signal I've ever had. HD channels are crisp and clear and I get more locals than our satellite provider furnishes. It has one minor flaw, the included cable is cheap and useless. The connector came off when I attached it to the tv, but I had spare RG-6 to make my own.Overall, a great item and made in the USA.

I use this all the time, especially I don't have to stoop down to type on my laptop anymore when I keep my laptop on the coffee table!I love small keyboards so I was thinking of buying the happy hacker keyboard but I found reviews that it doesn't play well with the Macs.

I have them in the back of my 2005 Xterra, paired with a set of 6.5" component Rockfords in the front. The sound these put out is amazing, clear, and full. I did not use the enclosure, rather went with a more stock look (and the speaker enclosure is designed well enough for that to happen). I can't think of anything negative to say about them, installation was easy, and they truly sound awesome. I did, however, have to drill new holes in my Xterra for them to fit properly, and had to fabricate a seating for them (the speaker enclosures are really rather strange in this particular vehicle) but that is a comment more on Nissan than Rockford Fosgate.

$REVIEW.: I bought the Cybertron for my 12 year old and he loves it.  We have a 3 year old quad core desktop that really wasn't meant for gaming and I needed to get his games off of it anyway.  We were researching gaming computers and came across another brand first, but saw the great reviews on this PC and decided to go for it along with a 24&amp;#34; ASUS Full HD monitor that also received good reviews.  My son is not a hard core gamer, but enjoys playing Minecraft and several different games on Steam.  From what I have seen, the graphics are fantastic and there doesn't appear to be any lag time with any of the games.  The customer service also seems to be good, but hopefully I won't ever have to call them with a problem.  Great computer at a very decent price.

$REVIEW.: After having owned numerous 'line-doublers' (all the way back to Faroudja upscaling my 480i sources to 480p for my first home theater,) and innumerable HDMI switchers, I have finally found a series that takes the alphabet soup of HDMI versions and handles it with aplomb while being the cleanest and most easy to use upscaler to 1080p that I've used to date. Add the Green Word to my two previous DVDO Edge units, and I am even happier.So, after having issues with HDCP handshakes, HDMI versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3a, and 1.3b not playing well with most autoswitching units--this product from DVDO does all of the above with aplomb.Want to take your upscaling DVD player, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, TiVo HD, Wii, and more and mix and match audio inputs to a single optical output? Done.Want them all at true 1080p (including your wee-little wii?) Done.Want to get rid of the "Sugar/Mosquito-Noise/Sparkle issue from compression of your HD inbound signal? Nicely done.Want to see everything pop better on your HD screen without looking artificially processed? Simply Done.Want power-on priority for various units in your system (the TiVo comes before the Xbox 360, and the Oppo comes before the PS3?) Again, done and done well.Add a simple remote, ability to tweak at will (should you even want to) and you have a massive winner of a product.My biggest worry was any effect I'd have on speed of play with the game consoles--no issue... It not only has a game mode but takes Wii-Widescreen 480p and puts it out at a solid 1080p/60 and looks great doing it.Films on Blu-Ray with 1080p/24 are stellar (minus the extra stars in the black sky from compression issues.)All in, I heartily recommend this product--and you'll note that I am fairly even in pans, middling reviews, and OK product discussions, but rarely give a rave.This is a rave and applause to the DVDO crew. Our household has three DVDO Edge units and counting now.[Consider this a laughter-and applause-filled standing ovation.]

 Wanted to use it a while and try a few different things before writing the review

 Also my G5 Mac tower did not at first have an eSATA card..

 If you try transferring a couple hundred GB over USB 2.0, you can pretty much start it and go to work, it may be done when you return

 With the MAC, the set up was seamless and with the new Tempo Sonnet eSATA card (see my other review), the transfers were lightning fast

 The fanless operation had me concerned for over-heating, but I have to say after leaving it on for over 60 days now and using it daily for automatic file backup and frequent storage &amp; retrieveal of files - esp movie files sized 50GB+, I am astonished at the performance of this drive
 No perceptible heat emanating either
 Read- and write-times over eSATA are still leaving me with that stupid look you get when technology is ahead of your comprehension..

you don't have to like being left behind, you just have to accept it


Plus it's 'green' - apparently hard drives can consume dumploads of juice, and this one saves a few greenback saving on power consumption, which is a huge plus


 I'd spent countless hours trying to find the drive with the best combination of speed, reliability and value, and I have to say I'm gloating a bit right now with the Fantom Green Drive!

The cord is great and the price was certainly better than the Apple store, even with postage

It works great and I think better and faster than my old cord

So I may have been right about the frayed part slowing down the charging process
At any rate it is a good buy and the folks that sent it were timely too.

We recently got a 40" HD TV and needed a replacement for the VCR -- we wanted to record shows (and On-Demand movies) at a good enough quality for HD viewing.One option was DVR from Comcast for $10/month (which might or might not allow recording of On-Demand movies and transfer to computer for disc-burning).  Another option was using a computer with a video acquisition device and record to hard drive.  The third option was this unit for $110, delivered, from Amazon -- hands down the most practical choice.Though this unit doesn't record in true HD resolution, the quality is about the same (in 2 hour mode, 16x9) as regular 16x9 enhanced DVDs.  At first I was worried the recorded discs might not play on other DVD players; but they did, no problem at all on any of our equipment (that is, after the recording is finalized).  The recording time for a DVD-R disc (on high quality mode) was 2 hours and 8 minutes.  (On lower quality modes, it's 4+ hours and 8+ hours.)Navigating the menu system is easy enough, and each recorded disk is given a simple menu with the various recordings available to choose from (which by default have the date &amp; time of recording as the title, but can be renamed).Upconversion of commercial DVDs is quite good (enough so that we're not that motivated to get a Blu-Ray player yet ;-).Our only complaints (which are very minor) are that the tray-eject is a little slow &amp; noisy and that there isn't component video inputs (just composite video &amp; S-Video inputs).  But it was easy enough to hook up to our cable box (or TV) to record from their outputs.This will be a great unit to have until Blu-Ray recorders become less expensive.

$review_text.: This sleeve fits the Sony TT laptops as well as the Sony sleeve

It it less costly and has the added convenience of the handles.Excellent buy, unless you want the VAIO brand name on your sleeve.

$REVIEW.: Seems very bright to me. It blinks lite about the room, in different colors, and certainly mimics a TV.I kind of think its sort of in 'action-movie' mode, as the lighting changes seem to be /kind of/ frequent.But it definitely shows thru to the outside of my home. Its smart. If someone needs a brighter model, they must be in a very brightly lit area.Typical streetlights or some low tv-watching lighting in that room do not deter its effect, they may enhance it  by toning it down a little. But its fine,  and very good on its own in a dark room. Or semi- dark! It saves electricity too, vs. the real TV that I have used for many years. Even when home&amp;#8230;.! Just because.. If you want the look of activity around your place, this is a good idea.

Now Panasonic wants me to pay for S&amp;H to "look at it and determine if the warranty applies". I don't care if these headphones sound great, if the quality and warranty are bad then the whole deal is crap. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.

But why oh why does just docking or undocking interrupt so many apps???? It's crazy but some completely crash, some reload from start, and any streaming app ceases upon a dock or undock. These things don't happen when you plug in the USB charger, so they don't have to happen when you dock. But for now, they do. It may be that future firmware could fix this terribly annoying thing. But if you can live with the interruptions, this dock is everything else I hoped it would be.You'll want to buy a long Micro-USB cable and maybe a new AC adapter too, as this does not come with any, and the stock Nexus charge cable isn't long enough for convenient locations.

$REVIEW.: If you are just starting out on computer audiophile, it is a decent cable with decent sound.I did comparison between this Belkin Gold Series cable, Tripp Lite U023-006 6ft and Audioquest Forest...there are different characteristics but the basic ones we are looking for are found in this Belkin one too
If you detest it, use it for printer or other device connections.

$REVIEW.: We have one vehicle with an installed DVD system, but this is such a brilliant idea if you don't have a DVD system and occasionally like to let your kids play and watch movies on your ipad. My kids love that they don't have to hold the ipad, and it's good for occasional use. I certainly wouldn't recommend this as a permanent solution, but for the odd road trip here and there, this is THE solution!

Sadly, the image from the Blu-Ray player would show for a few seconds and then suddenly go black. Doing some more research revealed that the converter isn't HDCP compliant and thus could not be used in the way that I wanted to use it.So if you are looking to connect a Blu-Ray player to a computer monitor, this is not what you need. You are better off getting a straight DVI to HDMI cable. I purchased one from BlueRigger once I realized this adapter wouldn't work, and that cable works just fine.

$REVIEW.: I recently bought a small HDTV that would get only occasional use, making cable impractical
 I figured a basic antenna would suffice in a major metropolitan area, but not so

 I don't know if it is the antenna or the location, but I can't get more than the local NBC affiliate most times, and we're only ten miles from a major city.

I still have to do some tests to see how they fare against the Pearstone, but since I've started using a grip recently, and my average use is for both video and pictures (sometimes I take more pics, sometimes I record more movies), I don't have a solid ground to say how much they last on a single charge.Anyway, this amazing pack with 2 batteries, a charger and even a car adapter is sold for less than a single Pearstone and just a bit more than a single Photive, so I think it's well worth it!In the future I may update this review to comment about reliability, but so far, no problems found!

Much more cost effective and you cannot buy the 30 pin to SD card seperatly at this time.

$REVIEW.: I use this to clean my lenses all the time! You can't believe the dust, dirt, and grime that sticks to your lens. Once, I accidently focused on the dirt so the picture showed all the dirt... it was amazing! If you want better pictures, you need to start with a cleaner lens.The brush is great, and the smudge remover really does work. I don't understand how it works, because if you touch the smudge remover to your skin, it leaves a black residue. I have no troubel with black smudges on my lens after using it. I don't know how, but it works!Must have for all!
$review_summary.: Works great!

$REVIEW.: The Sansa e260 4GB MP3 player lives up to all the features that I wanted: it is small, easy to use (intuitive), has all controls in an easy-to-access position, has a control-lock feature to prevent inadvertently modifying settings, has a bright screen, and - best of all - accepts micro flash cards so that I can retain my 'base' music catalogue and still provide, from time to time, other offerings as well

 The built-in microphone allows the Sansa to act as a voice recorder; I have not used this feature yet


 It is also possible, of course, to store animations, movies, and images on the Sansa.The sansa comes with re-charging and data-transfer cable, lanyard, and soft storage bag

 The lanyard is large enough that I can hang the Sansa around my neck
 The Sansa is heavy for its size - a feature that I like; the weight reminds me that I am carrying it and helps prevent loss.It is highly recommended to anyone who wants a great value at a good price.

We were looking to get out of point and shoot  cameras and move into something with more features and better photos.This camera fits the bill for both. This camera is easy to use and to takes outstanding photos. Although we are still figuring out all the features, we have been impressed with its ease of use and the many features available to us.We are going to take a camera class to learn more about this camera and will update our review once we have used the camera longer.December 2012 - Now that we have owned the camera for nearly a year, we can still give this item great marks. It is a very easy to use camera and it takes outstanding pictures. Another nice feature is the number of photos you can take without having to download to a computer.  Would highly recommend this product.

$review_text.: I knew that this bag wasn't the biggest one ever made, but I was not prepared for how small it really is.  I have a D90 with 18-105 lens.  Everything from the D90 kit (camera, lens, charger, cords, etc) will fit in this bag if you package it carefully.I liked the looks of this bag and figured I could make it work, so that's why I bought it.  It works, but forget about taking extra lenses.  I figured from the picture that I could fit my owner's manual in the zipper-net compartment under the lid.....NOPE!!  TOO SMALL!!It's a nice, well made, bag but it's too darn small for a D90.  I can't imagine that it would work much better with a D40, D3000, or D5000....especially if you intend to carry more gear than what came in your camera kit.If you never intend to buy any extra lenses and have a shoehorn handy, then this is your bag!  Otherwise, look for something bigger.

$review_text.: I ordered this Adorama 55mm Lens to 77mm Filter Step-Up Adapter.  However the vendor, Video Camera Center, sent my at Bower ring instead.  It seems to work ok, but it is not the Adorama that is shown, and further the Bower was rated 1 star.  So, if you order, you may not get the exact ring you ordered.  I would have paid the extra money to get a B&amp;W ring, but Amazon did not carry in this size.  The B&amp;W is finished much nicer in a flat black, instead of the shiny finish this one has.

$review_text.: Well, I won't claim this is a perfect product, I have usediPod 20GB, Creative Zen Extra 40gb, iRiver PMP-140(40GB),iRiver H10 5GB/20GB. By far I consider archos is thebest among all.I don't like iPod or Creative. Don't get me wrong, they arefind products, but I just hate the way they organize themusic purly by the information stored inside the MP3 files.I like to organize my songs by directories and sub-directories,and maybe sub-directories under sub-directories, just like ahard drive. But in iPod and Creative I feel like all my albumsare spreaded all over the table, I have to scroll down severalpages to locate an album. Not to mention the information storedinside the songs is not always accurate. In some languages,the same word can have different codes. Like chinese has Big5and GB, so the same singer published by TaiWan and Mainlandchina will appear under two names! And the two names are notalways together!I had huge problem with iRiver PMP-140. The damn thing automaticallyswitch between play and fast forward, it doesn't play 192 bit.Finally I had to return it.iRiver H10 5GB is a nice product, but a little too expensiveconsidering its small disk size, and it doesn't connect to PCsmoothly, some day it gets connected with no problem, some dayit doesn't, there are weird ways to solve the problem on internet,just google it.iRiver H10 20GB is OK, but transferring songs is super slow,especially on a celeron processor, plus, the battery is notinterchangable, and you can't just plug it in any computerand expect it to be connected -- you need to log in as anadministrator to install software, This is going to be aproblem for people like me who doesn't have administratorprivilege on a office PC.OK, so how do I like this Archos 220? First, the compact flashcard reader is the best! I am a photo enthusiast. I take tonsof photos with my Nikon D70. With gmini 220, I literally takewith me a 20GB harddisk! I can transfer my photos to the Gmini220 anytime I want. Got memory stick? no problem, buy the 4-in-1compact flash card adaptor and you are good to go! Don't trustthe so called "USB-on-the-fly" thing, First you to carry a cableor a card reader with you, second it doesn't work with all cameras,Third, most "USB-on-the-fly" supports only USB1.1 host, the transferspeed is terribly slow. I tried the one on that iRiver PMP-140, itliterally takes 15 seconds to transfer one picture file -- you willprobably run out of battery before you finish transferring files.On my Gmini 220, One 3Mb photo takes less than 1 second. I spent avacation to Vegas and Grand Canyon a few weeks ago, where I took over1GB photos, all photos were transferred to my gmini220 and carriedback safely, no problem at all!I also like the way gmini connects to PC: no software required,no installation, no need to log in as an administrator. When youconnect to a PC, it becomes a hard drive automatically. copyingfiles to 220 is just like copying files from one disk to another.I did have connection problem on one of my older Dell PC, but itconnects perfectly on my all other newer PCs and laptops. Accordingto archos website, they suggest you to upgrade BIOS, I yet to trythat out.It has dual organization methods of your music library. You canbrowse your music files through directory structure, just like whatyou would do on a PC hard drive, or, if you prefer, you can use ARClibrary, which is similar to windows Media player, search your libraryby singer, album etc.The screen of gmini220 is bigger than other MP3 players, although itis black/while, but I found it is very practical, I've never wantedto view my photo or video in a tiny little screen, why do I needa color screen?But as I said, it is not perfect. here are something that I thinkarchos should improve:1 The factory-installed battery really sucks, they should use highercapacity battery and make it interchangable2 There is ZERO customer serivce, they don't reply your email and theirphone line is always busy3 No carrying case, my screen got scratched the 2nd day I got it.4 It's a little bit ugly, not a main issue for guys like me, butprobably your girl friend won't like it.5 If only it is 40GB ...6 It does support Asia languages like Chinese, but you can displyeither GB or Big5, not both. That is annoying but not a disaster,some Big5 characters still gets displayed correctly under GB system(vice verse).Overall I like the gmini 220 and would recommend it to any of my friends.I did hear a lot of complaint about this unit on internet, but strangely,I personally have no problem with mine at all, probably I am lucky? don'tknow, will report later if I encounter problems.

$REVIEW.: I have 2 room mates here so I often use the splitter to play things for one of them. Usually the other is busy talking on skype or vent or teamspeak and has no interest or it will disturb the other who is sleeping. regardless of the situation this works very well for it's intended use. The Female sides lock in your headphones very tightly. you have to apply pressure to get them in and you'll hear a click when their in. The male side fits like any other headphones. so if you drop a mp3 (psp in my case) usually the splitter will come out before my headphones which is good because it's less strain on my headphones that way.

$review_text.: I bought the clear case for my brand new MacBook Pro 13". Let me tell you how much I love it.A- It's almost invisible. You can barely see it. I've seen people with colored cases and they look ..... uhhh ..... weird !B- Protects my MacBook from dings, dents, scratches .....etc.C- Doesn't add up too much space or weight. My MacBook can still fit in my Brenthaven trek sleeve which barely fits like a glove (with or without the case).D- Someone said it gives a gloss and I see it as a plus not a minus.E- Someone said it's hard to remove. Again, big plus. You don't want it falling off and breaking !Want to keep your Mac in as-new condition, get the clear shell !

The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most
That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig

Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go.Look, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space


 Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens

You can always "resize" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space


Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.You never know
I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things
I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park

If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!Matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea
No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems


They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer
They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable

I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality


If you want quality buy SONY!

Temps were never more than 78C on either card in this configuration.One day, I came home from work and the computer was powered off.  I checked things out only to notice that one of the 7950s had a nice black, burned area on the backside of the PCB where something had fried.  I got on Amazon to do an RMA and was fortunate that I still had 12 minutes left in the return period, so back it went.I restarted the computer with the remaining single 7950 and it has been running for a few weeks just fine.  This last Tuesday, I just happened to be watching TV, which is in the same room as the computer, and I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye.  I saw the LEDs power off, then the computer tried to power back on, and another flash/visible flame lept out of the 7950, and everything powered-down as I got that pungent stench of burning electronic components filling my house.I happened to be lucky to notice this and I yanked the cord from the wall before anything got worse.  Fortunately, I have a good power supply (Corsair GS700) that has over-current protection and drops into safe-mode when this kind of thing happens, or else who knows if I would have come home to nice little fire that day when the first card fried while I was at work.I'll be RMAing this second 7950 because I can no longer return it to Amazon.  However, after having TWO of these fail in EXACTLY the same way, I can say that I have pretty much zero faith that I'll run the replacement in my computer and will probably just ebay it or try to sell it to someone else.  Worrying about fires is not worth it.I've uploaded photos showing the burned PCB if you'd like to see.  These Gigabyte cards might be fine for gaming where you're just playing a light/medium load for a couple hours, but if you're looking to do hardcore GPU computing (Bitcoin, Litecoin, hashcracking, etc.) I'd strongly advise that you look elsewhere.

$review_text.: If you're looking for a router to browse the internet and do some light video streaming, this will work just fine.  However, I have two teenage boys who like to play video games.  We experienced alot of packet loss, lag and sometimes even complete signal loss for a minute or two.  This only happened when someone was using up a bunch of bandwidth, or if someone was playing an online game like Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends.  I had to abandon this router, because it didn't work well for us.  It just caused alot of frustration.

$review_text.: My reason for buying this particular camera was the "anti-shake" image stabilization. Too many of my picture are, eh, taken during an earthquake, as the old joke goes. Well, the very first time that I gave this camera a road test, I found myself at the coast, wanting to take pictures with full zoom, while strong sea winds almost blew me off my feet. "Captain, permission to engage image stabilization?" "Make it so, number one!".And miraculously, none of my pictures were shaken or stirred. I love this thing.Another big plus is the big LCD on the back. It's big, it's gorgeous, and it makes you excited about your pictures while you're taking them. There is something psychological going on there, but the fact is that the LCD makes you fall in love with the camera and your own picture taking capability, even before you have seen the result.I'm giving this thing 4 stars instead of 5 because of two niggles. One: turning off the flash is confusing. Bizarrely, it seems you can not change flash settings when the anti-shake is engaged. Two: the lens is placed to the edge of the camera body, and I regularly find a finger of my left hand dangling in front of it. As a result I need to hold it in a somewhat unnaturally feeling way.But on the whole I'm very happy with this camera. And small and black it looks very sexy.

$review_text.: No doubt these are wonderfully sounding headphones. The problem I had was using a sansa fuze and a Fiio e6 amp the headphones would cut out or clip when turned up too loud.I've never had headphones do this..I use Sennheiser px-100, Metro Fi 220s, Panasonic RP-HT600s(get a pair of these if you can..worth it to add for the price..they are great cans) and none cut out..or pop..I think it's called clipping..but these do really bad..This is just my experience with this setup. They do sound amazing at normal volume.I give it 5 stars for sound..just didn't work for my setup I suppose..

$review_text.: Happy with my purchase and worth the price. Would recommend to others. A few notes since nobody else has reviewed this yet.Video &amp; audio quality are as expected and very good.Wireless feature is not usable for me.  I have my wireless network locked down in part by MAC address (if you don't know what that means, you can safely ignore this part of the review).  Unfortunately, the camera does not tell you what its MAC address is, and it isn't located anywhere on the body. The manual is likewise missing any information on this. And for those of you who say I can just have my router scan my network for it, I live in a townhouse community with like 100 other wireless devices all showing up on scans.Built-in 8gb of storage is great, but you'll still need to get a memory card if you are going to use this thing for real. I picked up a SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 30MB/s (SDSDU-064G-U46) and it works fine with no issues.Stock battery sticks out the back some since the camera was shrunk down to be small.  I'm fine with it, wife hates it. If you choose to upgrade to a bigger battery, this will be even more pronounced.  If you plan on recording more than 90 minutes or so, you'll need a bigger battery.Touchscreen isn't like your iPad - you've gotta press a fair amount to get it to register what you're doing. I find myself having to put my free fingers behind the panel to help hold it since I have to push so much.  I've gotten more familiar with this over the past week or two, but I still like to hold the touchscreen.  Also, touchscreen isn't the most accurate. I don't have chubby fingers, but it doesn't always click where I want it to. Again, I've gotten better with practice at clicking where I want, but it still sometimes goes goofy.  I still prefer a joystick.Has a mini hot shoe.  Haven't used it yet, but be aware if you have full sized hot shoe accessories.Don't think my griping makes me regret my purchase. Like I said before, I'm happy with the purchase and would buy it again. Photo &amp; video/audio quality are great.

 Since there is no optical drive, I recommend downloading Open Office to work on your Office docs
 Firefox is also the faster browser on this machine than IE.The pros --Good keyboard except for the right shift key as noted by others
 Once you get used to it, it's acceptable.-XP operating system makes it easy to use.-Lots of USB ports.-Good internet connectivity.-Screen is very bright.-Excellent portability, I no longer lug around a 15" laptop when this can do the job.-Fast enough with the Intel Atom

 The Celeron is slower with lower battery life.-Seems well built and thought out.-Great battery life but not quite 7 hours as ad says.-Doesn't scrimp on ports, ram, hard disk


With other companies, these are expensive extras.-Instructions divulge honesty about laptop batteries - first time a pc company said not to buy batteries if you are not going to use them since they do not store well


 I liked that.Cons and these are minor:- Not sure why the hard drive is partitioned in two.- Price bumps up against low end Vista laptops but this is a speciality item.Overall, I love it.

Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power.  Ever since I got the iTorch, that problem no longer exists. The iTorch is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a "worry-free" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the iTorch, both those problems is solved. The flashlight comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use.The one drawback to the iTorch is that everyone wants to use it.

"Flash"--what a joke.I tested one yesterday


In a USB 2.0 computer slot (not a hub), it took 21 minutes to transfer 2.43 GB
That means it takes 35 freaking minutes to copy 4 GB onto this dumb thing! These stupid flash drives are totally useless for any sort of serious data transfer.One star

They work, and they fit the USB slot, that's about all
But the speed is simply wretched

This is many times SLOWER than a DVD burner! Too bad this review will be buried among the positive reviews.Two megabytes per second sounds fast

$REVIEW.: The Diamond VC500 capture device is awesome!Load the driver program, open the program, plug in the device in the USB, connect to A/V outputs on a VCR or a DVD player, start to play your source (VHS or DVD) and you will see it on your computer screen and hear it through your audio card.  Then, when you see the scenes you want, press the record button on the device or on the program and you are capturing.The tool command on the program allows you to adjust picture capture quality and output mode (and quality).After years of handling videos by direct transfer from VCR to VCR in order to make a composite, now I can do the editing on my computer.  The files created can be used and edited directly in Windows Movie Maker (the device comes with another editing program, but I find WMM to be easier to use with a wider range of output files).As a person using clips from many movies in an educational setting to illustrate my topics, this device has made my life much easier -- and the quality of what I get is much, much better!!!!!And all of this for a price much less than the usual video-capture internal card.(and a hint - you can use this device with sources such as phonographs or tape decks to capture and edit the sound through your USB port without having to delve into the audio input ports on the back of your PC.)

$REVIEW.: I bought the mp704 after being enticed by the [$$$] rebate and sale price in January. Set up was remarkably easy. Picture quality is great. 1 dead pixel, not in a bothersome location.On the specs, I e-mailed their tech support. The higher specs listed on their web site are correct, not the lower specs in the guide in the box. 500:1 contrast and 25ms response. The explanation is that their componenets are improving all of the time.I also found out that most of their 17 inch monitors use the same LCD. The only thing that paying for the speakers and such of the higher end models gets you is those bells and whistles. The picture quality is the same.I'd say quite a deal

$review_text.: If this was the first powered sub I tried I would be very happy with it.  But alas, it is not the first (the first was actually a Cambridge Soundworks model).  I found that while playing this sub, I am unable to get the really deep base I get out of my Cambridge Soundworks and therefore the lower rating.  Now, I am not saying this is a  bad product though, quite the opposite.  It is a very good speaker with crisp base sound and is able to give sufficient lows for most music/movies.

That's the upshot.Installation: Mounting this on the roof is a task not to be taken lightly. I am a big DIY guy, so not an issue for me. I used PVC pipe, with L brackets, tie-wraps and copper strapping to attached the PVC to my house.  I used an iPhone app to find the nearest Verizon tower and pointed this bad boy straight at it.  It works great.  BTW, I used to have the standard ZBoost antenna up there, and it was only marginally better than none at all. This yagi works great.  The interior zBoost range is only about 15 feet, through walls, so this is really for my home office, not the whole house.Downside: my daughter says my house looks &amp;#34;ghetto&amp;#34; with this thing attached to the peak.  I think it makes us look like an NSA outpost.  If either of these sound like deal-breakers to you, you're probably not as desperate as I was to keep business calls from dropping.

$REVIEW.: This MP3 player is amazing.  I've been searching for a replacement for my Nano who's battery only lasts about 1 hour per charge these days.  I think this is a much superior product in many ways.First off, the Pros:1.  Battery life.  So far, I've been playing video and MP3s on one charge about 9 hours and the battery light is still 1/2 full.  The statistics claim 10 hours of video and 30+ hours of MP3 songs.  I don't know if I'll get that much, but so far I'm very happy.2.  My favorite feature of this player is that it does not rely on ID3 tags in order to catalog your music.  The majority of my MP3 collection is several years old and do not have ID3 tags embedded in the file.  My nano would not recognize these songs, but this player just plays based on files and folders.  Adding music requires no 3rd party software, just a simple drag and drop in Windows Explorer.  Couldn't be easier and I love it this way.3.  Sound quality is superb.  There is a 5 band EQ, plus "clear bass" enhancement that really brings out the lows insongs.  The EQ really lets me customize my music to my liking.  The sound quality is better than any MP3 player I've ever heard.  Sony hit a home run on this player!4.  The video feature is outstanding.  2.4" LCD screen is bright and colorful.  I didn't buy it for the video capability, but it's surely a cool bonus.5.  Navigation is a cinch.  I didn't even need to read through the instructions and I was able to navigate all the menus in a few short minutes.  The buttons on the unit are firm and responsive, and feel like they'll hold up for years.  The volume and hold buttons are on the side of the unit and are easy to access.6.  The player will bookmark your movie file for you.  So if you stop a movie and switch over to playing MP3, and then later on want to continue you movie, it will start up where you left off.  Nice feature.  And when the unit is powered off, and then powered back on, it remembers where you were in your last MP3 song (I've read that some Sony units won't do this, but this one does).Cons:1.  The file transfer speed seems pretty slow to me given it's USB 2.0.  Takes about 3 minutes to transfer a 500MB movie.  About 50 seconds to transfer a standard MP3 album.  Not a huge deal, but my Nano was much quicker.2.  When you unplug the player from the USB cable, and have hundreds of files on it like I currently have, it has to build the library, which can take up to 30 seconds, before you can access it.  Again, a minor quirk, but nothing is perfect!3.  No FM radio, no recorder.  I can live without these features, but they may be more important to other people.  If keeping these features off the unit allows for more battery space, that's fine with me!All in all, I'd highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a high quality, great sounding MP3 player that does not require special software (re: iTunes) to run.

$review_text.: This product is by far the coolest (pun intended) cooling pad for my laptop. After trying a Belkin and Targus model, both failed miserably after prolonged usage (I am an avid gamer, most times are 5-6 hour sessions when I can). This pad seemed the way to go and I was correct. Many demanding and temperature-rising games later, this unit still functions exactly as I need. The relocatable fans is, by far, the neatest thing about this pad because you can target &amp;#34;heat spots&amp;#34; specifically and deliver cooler air to them (Instead of a generalized wind movement from other units). Another thing worth mentioning is this cooling pad doubles as a carrying handle for your laptop if you want.PROS:Relatively inexpensive &amp;#34;insurance&amp;#34;Protects against overheating (Really dropped my CPU and GPU temps under stress!)Doubles as a carry handleHas relocatable fans to target the source(s) of heatVery sturdy design and qualityVariable speed fan controlFar surpasses other brands in longetivity, value, and qualityCONS:Quite largeUncomfortable to rest in your lap (I'm assuming this was designed to stay on a desk)Clips that hold fans in place can be unlatched and pushed out from topside by accidentConclusion:A superior cooling pad for your laptop at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend and buy again!

$REVIEW.: I've only owned an iPod nano, and have never been able to hold all of my music. I am quite pleased that I purchased this classic iPod instead of the touch. It has a lot more gbs, and is not as expensive. I already have an iPhone, so I didn't see a need for it. I just wanted more music space. The overall design is the same as it's always been, but I like the fact that the front is a matte black - the back is a shiny silver, with the standard apple logo. I recommend this item if you have a huge music library over the touch.

On the contrary. It seems that dozens if not hundreds of others have the same problem. Windows cannot find the correct driver on the cd or the web. But it gets better! I downloaded drivers from their website, but not a one of them worked. In fact, one driver that is supposed to be a windows driver turns out to be a Mac driver. I also downloaded and installed the most recent version of the software, but that doesn't work either.  There is something fundamentally flawed with this software if installing it is so difficult.

However, my wife owns an iPad 4 that her work reimbursed
This is my first Android tablet, but I've played around with many
This is the first Android tablet that has been able to convince me to buy

I also own a Galaxy Nexus smartphone and two 5" Samsung Galaxy Players (for kids,) as well as the original Kindle Fire that my 3 year old uses.What convinced me to buy?o Thin and lighto Decent battery lifeo Higher resolution screen w/16:10 ratioo Waterproofo IR blastero Elegant designo Sony claim to upgrade Android OSDoes the tablet live up to my expectations?Thin and Light: Extremely impressive! This tablet is so thin and light for a 10" tablet

After using iPad 4 with protective case, this brings a smile to my face when I pick it up


If thin and light is a top concern for you, this is the one
Even my kids love holding this...so much so that my 8 year old thinks it's hers!Decent Battery Life: The battery life of the Tablet Z varies widely

When frugal to moderate, it can easily achieve the claimed battery life of around 8-10 hours

The way I use it with Wifi on,I typically get around 8 hours use

The screen brightness has the biggest impact
When full bright, it will drain the battery very quickly, 4-6 hours depending on what you are doing

With full bright, the AC charger can't even keep up during use

Your battery will keep draining

Even bringing down brightness to about 80% makes a big difference


Around that point, the battery starts to charge back up when plugged in and using the tablet

At 50%-65% seems to be a good balance between brightness and reaching the upper levels of battery life claim.Higher Resolution Screen: The reason I didn't bite on tablets such as the Note 10 is because of the resolution
It isn't bad, but not great
The Tablet Z is sharp, but compared to my wife's iPad 4, it's noticeably behind

If you don't compare to the iPad 4, it is really very good


The 16:10 ratio offers closer to a 1080P experience once softbars are in play

For this reason, I appreciate the 16:10 (1920x1200) resolution

Like any other large tablet, it is harder to type with both thumbs in landscape mode

However, portrait mode is better for typing

Color saturation is not overdone and yet renders colors well.*UPDATE 14 AUG 2013* I bought a great little app from the Google Play Store called "Thumb Keyboard" and it makes typing in landscape much much better by offering a split keyboard
It works perfectly with this extra wide tablet

It even helps typing in portrait mode become a better experience

I love that I can add custom mapped buttons on the top row for items like the comma and apostrophe


I am typing this update from the Xperia Tablet Z

Of course, this app can be used on any tablet or phone.Waterproof: We all like a little novelty
The waterproof claims are good

I have the freedom to use this tablet in places I wouldn't dare with other devices

I've used it in the tub, shower, pool, and even wash it in the sink


What you need to know, though, is that if you completely submerse the tablet, it is not functional due to the fact water does conduct electricity

The screen gets confused and does crazy things as if one were touching it all over the place randomly

The good news is, if watching a movie in the tub and it gets splashed, it can take a fair amount of splashing without acting like it is completely submersed

To keep it waterproof, the power, headphone and SD ports have covers on them


Especially power, can be a bit annoying taking on and off all the time

The flap can get in the way while plugging in the power cord
Even with a tiny "latch" to hold the cover when off, it does not hold tightly and gets jarred off easily

I'm used to it and willing to live with this minor inconvenience for the waterproof ability.IR Blaster: If you love TV and want a universal remote, this tablet works well

You can customize the layout, although it isn't always the easiest experience

 Bottom line, it works
I've always been interested in the Logitech Harmony remotes and with this, I no longer care to spend money on those remotes

Considering how expensive some of those are, this could be a nice justification in and of itself

The TV guide-like functionality does require an app download
I've used it and it is neat


It works
I set up my Samsung TVs and Bluray players with little fuss
It just worked.Elegant Design: This is subjective, but I think it is very nice looking compared to Samsung tablets


It's simple and elegant
I don't mind at all showing it off.OS Upgrade: I am currently on Android 4.1.2
It came with 4.1.1

I'm still waiting on 4.2, which is supposed to allow multiple user accounts
As of August 5, 2013, I heard 4.2 is around the corner with 4.3 being pushed out even later

While not here yet, I do appreciate knowing I can eventually get those upgrades.Other Notes:o I wish this had a dedicated button/switch to lock screen rotation like the iPad 4
As is, it takes 2 taps just to get to the menu
Other key settings that people want to change on the fly are also two taps away just to see the options

I'd rather it be only one tap away

Since Sony lightly skinned the Android OS, I'd like to see this change


This includes screen brightness, WiFi on/off, and Airplane Mode.o Camera picture quality is so-so

It's there

It needs very good lighting to take decent pictures

There is no LED light.o Video is the same as camera notes.o Sound quality was highly touted by Sony

In reality, speaker does get good loudness, but quality isn't anything impressive


In fact, when loud, it kind of hurts the ears

Compared to iPad 4, the Sony sound lacks much full body and depth and richness
iPad 4 wins hands down
I also own a couple of very high end headphones from Audez'e and HiFiMan and the sound with those headphones plugged in  is better


It's not as good as my Cowon player, but it's good.o Price/Value: Honestly, I'd say it isn't worth the high price unless you must have thin and light and waterproof features


These are the areas it stands out compared to other 10" inch tablets and where the others are lacking


I was willing to pay for the thin and light, and am happy with the purchase for that reason alone.Conclusion:Mainly because it could be better in the value department, and because of a few other nitpicky points, I give the Sony Xperia Z Tablet 4 Stars

The Sony and iPad each have their appealing points
The choice comes down to which OS environment you want, and which features mean the most to you.

I had been looking for something powerful and at the time (1 1/2 years ago) went with the MacBook Pro 17" unibody. Nice machine decent performance, but had to run Windows for all my business applications. The 17" is not the best machine to travel so I searched for a "travel machine". Did try the iPad, but it did not do the job. Mostly the job of office applications, mail and calendaring did not work the way you need for business. Not saying the iPad does not have its use, but not what I needed. In addition I quickly realized I need a keyboard and when you finally prop it up, you kind of need a mouse. That is something Apple does not ALLOW you to do based on their license agreement. Even so I jailbroke the iPad, it did not solve the larger problem of having a lightweight machine, with touch; with all the business applications and the entertainment stuff I wanted.My second stop was an ASUS T101MT; the machine did a pretty decent job with everything for travel. Even so it took a lot of work to make the ATOM processors jive well. The touch and handwriting on the machine are great, but if you run a lot of applications sometimes a little sluggish to respond. However, for a little machine with keyboard for $449 on Amazon you cannot really complain. When this was announced at CES 2010, I was in line for one immediately. I was one of the first to pre-order and after waiting for 1 month I actually had my doubts if this will work out as they have release the machine without the very cool docking unit with keyboard they showed at CES 2010. When the machine arrived setup was a brise upgraded to professional and the machine is my main PC since that time. It outperforms my new MBP 17" and is a little slower than my ASUS G53, but that screen, the weight, the functionality AWESOME! The best about the whole package, for you Apple fans who don't like the price, is a MS 6000 Bluetooth keyboard is included, so are a very nice leather case and frankly the design of the pad and size fits landscape exactly in my elbow for comfort. Handwriting is so good with the included stylus that I haven't even trained or transferred my handwriting data from the T101. Already made a trip with it and it is the best of both worlds. Basically you get a cross between a MacBook Air and an iPad. The battery life could be better, but with some configuring I got it to last 4 hours and that is pretty decent. Would I love 10 hours, sure, but at the end of the day you have to consider this. I carry ONE device with ONE power supply that actually has an extra port for USB charging, and these are the nice surprises you get with the machine.Working on it for 2 weeks now and LOVE IT!

I have a Macbook Pro, 15". While it is certainly desirable that the card push in close to flush when it is inserted into the Express 34 slot, this card actually inserts below flush. This makes it very difficult to push in the card to get it to "click" again and remove it. On the other hand, when I insert my Sony Memory sticks using the included memory stick adapter that is necessary to use the card, pushing in the memory stick adapter often "clicks" the card, and then when I go to remove the memory stick adapter, it pulls out the card every time.So, if you have trouble getting the card to click and remove, use a memory stick adapter because it has enough friction drag to help you easily remove the card.I wanted to simply leave the card installed because I have nothing but SD and Memory stick memory from my devices. However, the card contains no little cover to protect the inside from gathering dust and dirt. You must therefore remove the card periodically and inspect the inside and clean. I actually took one of the memory stick adapters, and cut it off and adapted it so that it sticks out just a quarter inch so that it doubles as a cover and as a convenient card remover.

I like to keep my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+ on my desk at work, with weather or a clock displayed continuously.  This tablet requires a 2.1 amp adapter, similar to an iPad.  (A standard USB adapter is only 1.0 amps.)  Additionally, I was looking for a low-cost adapter.This adapter works perfectly for this purpose.  There are two USB ports; one is unmarked, the other is marked "iPad Compatible".  This seems somewhat misleading; when I plug my tablet into the port marked "iPad Compatible" it doesn't provide enough charge.  It seems similar to my other "standard" 1.0 amp adapters.  When I plug the tablet into the unmarked port, it seems to charge fully.The packaging claims that this product provides a TOTAL of 2.1A.  However, if I plug my iPod Touch into the second port, both the tablet and the iPod still seems to be charging.  (I'll experiment with this more and provide an update if I discover anything additional.)The packaging also claims "short circuit protection" and "over temperature protection".  I can't verify these claims, but hopefully they are true.Of course, I can't guarantee it will provide enough power for your particular device, but it does provide enough for mine.  I expect it will power any 2.1 amp device sufficiently.In short, it's an inexpensive ($7) adapter that will provide enough power.  I gave 4 stars, because I only give a product 5 stars if it is exceptional in some way.Frank

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased this camera-- I wanted a small, cheap backup camera, and the price Amazon was offering it at was incredible. Once the camera arrived, I took it out for several test shots under different lighting conditions (indoors w/ flash, bright indoors w/o flash, outdoors closeup &amp; distance). Uploaded the pics to my mac, took a good look, and returned it to Amazon within six hours of the first shot.Looking at the whole picture on the screen, the Fuji's image was noticeably "soft", and when zoomed in at all, they looked like watercolor paintings. Noise everywhere, even on shots where I dialed down the ISO. 4x6 printouts were barely acceptable, I'd never go larger. Overall image quality was what I'd expect in a camera from ~2000-2001, not a current generation camera. Compared with my other 5MP camera (an S2IS), these images were not useable. Still, this is a clever little camera that looks great &amp; would be very easy to carry as long as you're not picky about noise in the image.

$review_text.: Unfortunately when the wife bought this product she didn't spend the time reviewing the reviews
As many have said on here, this product arrived damaged and non-functioning

 Given the cost it's simply not worth returning

 Perhaps that's the vendor's game
 Basically selling non-functioning equipment for ridiculously cheap.Avoid at all cost


Best case scenario is slightly less than 50/50 chance it works.

$review_text.: Pretty easy to install. Very study. Hangs close to wall--as close as possible for my Samsung TV because of cords that need space in back, and really too close to easily manage cords once TV is hung. I cut a hole in the wall board to run cords and cable behind wall and installed a wall plate of this sort [On-Q / Legrand WP1014-WH-V1 Cable Access Strap with Wallplate, White] in space within the mount bracket .  To feed the 5 cords I had to hold the 40-inch TV off the mount. Had the TV been any bigger or heavier I could not have done it, and it was awkward and risky as I almost dropped it. Consider installation a 2-person job if TV is big or you are feeding cables.

$REVIEW.: ...and uses the same Samsung LCD panel for $100s less.  Mine worked great right out of the box and had NO dead pixels.  I use it mostly for programming and text is very sharp with both the DVI and VGA inputs.  Backlighting is very slightly shadowed near the screen perimeters but doesn't exhibit any coloration effects (Apple users have complained about "pink" panels.)Because it has a multiplicity of inputs, I can use this monitor simultaneously with my Mac and PC and DVD/cable TV signal - and still have the RGB, S-video and Analog DVI inputs left over!  The PIP feature lets me watch TV in one window and use the rest of the screen for my computer monitor great for late night channel+web surfing.My only real beef is the  stand - the base is very heavy, but because of the spring-loaded adjustable-height mechanism the panel itself still manages to move around and starts bouncing if I'm really typing hard.  86'ing the spring and using a nice simple manual lock-down screw would have solved this problem.Overall, highly recommended!

I've gotten clearer, punchier,  bass response for a $20 pair of Sony buds.The construction is cheep, wait, I meant CHEAP!  The wires are "angle-hair thin" and the connections are thrown together.THE KICKER:  My left side shorted out after three weeks--Three Weeks!When I contacted the company they were of no help. The "Service Rep" I spoke with treated me very disrespectfully, and didn't seem at all concerned that the "earphones of the stars" went bust inside of a month.I told them I wanted a refund, and sent them the goods with a receipt.  They said no, and then tried to sell me another pair for twice the original price. When I said "hell no," they agreed to send a replacement pair (I had to pay the shipping--are you kidding me?)All-in-all I would never again buy anything from this company. I don't care how recommended some of their products are.I'm all-about customer service.THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU ULESS YOU HAVE A RECORD DEAL!I don't know why they got into the retail market

Now that I got this, I have been using it for several days - so far, so good.I can hear the fan noise when it is plugged, but not as loud as my other power inverters


If I plug it in front of my Accord, the unit is very close to my shift gear, but the thing is, I can rotate it and swivel it to one side, which is nice.Pros:- Has all that I need, AC outlet and USB port (1 each)- Compact for portability- Comes with 2 USB cables - 1 standard and one microCons:- Pugly


Devoid of any aesthetic charms.- Swivel neck is suffering from a stiff neck

I thought I was breaking its neck when I turned it- Cheap looks, like Dolly Parton.

$review_text.: The built-in stand of this cover works great


 I eat while reading without holding my kindle, prop it on my lap while sitting in a chair, etc
 It protects the Kindle well, and is simple to put the Kindle in.Cons:- When the cover folds back flat, it doesn't want to stay there and it's not very comfortable to hold it that way for a long time.- The part that surrounds the keyboard makes it difficult to use the spacebar frequently

 Not an issue for occasional Kindle store purchase, but I notice a lot when playing the available word games that use spacebar as a frequent shortcut

 I find myself pulling the Kindle out of the case when playing games.As another reviewer noted, the pink being shipped is a much more vivid pink, not the pastel color shown here
 I love the color and ordered it after having read that other review.

Ergonomicaly I could say that the mouse is slightly superior to the Nano VX, but that could be subjective up to some point.It's nice that it utilizes an AA battery and a micro receiver. Both of those are ensuring long running time and high portability. Keep in mind that many of the laptop/netbook USB ports out there are NOT as deep as the nano receivers' plug length implies (1/2" ~ 12mm for both MS and Logi receivers) - and that means that in most machines out there the receiver's metal plug does not go all the way in the socket - some allow for 1/8"~2mm to stick out adding to the receivers length when pluged, some for even more.Real drawbacks? The mouse feels cheap (actually it was cheap, so no complains, but I would not pay the $49 asked by many retailers), but what really ruins the overall impression is the middle mouse button "clicking" action...it's - simply put -  terrible. Enough for ppl like my GF using it with middle-click intensive apps like SketchUp and ACAD/Revit to dislike and not use it.

Dubbing had no synch problems from tape to disc.This unit is an overall winner. Hands down it has the best reproduction.  Learning the quirky way to navigate takes some adjusting. Finalizing a disc also is more steps than other recorders which offer a disc menu and quick choice to finalize.

$review_text.: I bought this radio about a month ago and I was pleasantly surprised with its performance, especially on AM band. I own a small collection of portable radios (Grundigs, Sangean, Kaitos etc) and this little radio beats most of them in terms of AM sensitivity and selectivity. Among others, I am able to pull in AM stations from Seattle, Las Vegas, LA, San Diego, and multiple  Mexican stations on a nightly basis, despite powerful local AM stations that usually mask the weaker signals.FM performance is on par with other radios, you need to use headphones acting as an antenna to pull in weaker stations.Battery life is OK, better than other digital radios, although it definitely decreases if you use FM a lot.

This one fit perfectly behind the frame so you can't see it from the front
The price was an amazing deal too! So far, so good.The drive really only has about 3.5 GB of available space, just beware of that.

$review_text.: I purchased this wireless bridge to connect my Samsung TV and Sumsung Blue-ray DVD player to my wireless network.  After connecting the device to a laptop I ran through the web configuration.  If you've worked with bridge devices previously the setup is pretty much the same.  The biggest problem I encountered was determining what network settings to use on my laptop...it's not the normal 192.168.0.x.  Once configured the device has worked without a hickup.  Bridge speeds are more than adequate for Netflix streaming and Pandora streaming.  I'm happy with the device and would refer it to anyone looking for a step up from the basic consumer bridge models.

$REVIEW.: The only thing I am thrilled about this drive is the capacity

 Speed isn't any faster than better USB 2.0 drives


The big con is the poor construction quality


Just read other reviews and the issue of the component pulling out of the rubber casing is true

Once you feel a slight wiggle, check your drive immediately

You will notice that the rubber surrounding the connector end of the drive can be pried open
Once it becomes to separate like that, use a good epoxy filler and squeeze a good amount into the drive to seal back the rubber
Otherwise it will pull out completely eventually.

$REVIEW.: After My iPad 2 fell off the dash onto th floor and cracked the glass (Buy Apple Care)


Thus I needed protection that had a clear shield so I can swipe over the crack glass
I bought a Survivor


Nice Case

but my iRig mic could no longer plug in nor my camera connection kit

The cut out slots were cut to small
And taking the iPad out of the survivor takes a half hour, and a half hour to reassemble it

Thus this case is of no use to me

Who designed this.

While the first band was on stage, these blocked the really irritating - read, "most damaging" - sound levels. The second band was so INSANELY loud, it was not hearing-safe to even be in the venue with them on stage.

$REVIEW.: My wife and I will be taking a transcontinental flight soon.  I decided to buy some noise canceling headphones so we could watch a movie on our new ipad.  We don't fly often and my Scottish nature can't justify paying hundreds of dollars for headphones, especially since I have nice Grado and Sennheiser phones for home use. I did some homework and decided to buy these.  I also splurged and bought some [Audio Technica ATH-ANC1 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling On-Ear Headphones. We sometimes take business trips by ourselves and I thought the nicer pair could be used then.For the price, these Sonys aren't bad.  Sound quality is decent, much better than earbuds that come with iphones and the like.  Compared to nice headphones they lack detail and both low end and high end frequencies.  They are adequate for listening to movies but I wouldn't choose them to listen to music. They are comfortable, I don't see any problems wearing them for an extended time.They rely on passive and active means for noise cancellation. Just wearing them blocks out a fair amount of outside noise.  The active noise cancellation does work, but not as well as the Audio Technicas.

I think that's because of their inability to handle low frequencies more than the noise canceling circuitry.While I think these will suffice, especially at their bargain basement price, I think you would do well to step up to the next level of headphones, the ones in the </review_text><review_summary>Works great!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2HSCJ5XN882NJ"><latest_review_date>20/08/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0015DPJCA</product_id><review_date>20/08/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[2, 3]</review_helpful><review_text>This works really well to keep your lens centered when goimng from portrait to landscape orientation.

The only negative is that the esc button is too large so I do end up hitting the esc when i want to hit the #1. Once you get used to that it is fine though, but it is annoying. Otherwise, I love the keyboard and everyone thinks it is cool too.

$review_text.: Smaller than many point and shoot camera and lighter as well.  The kit lens is pretty normal but when one buys a zoom (I have the 45-200 Panasonic lens for it) the camera is awesome.  The viewfinder is crystal clear and sharp and images are the same.  Only downside is, that Panasonic needs to manufacture a larger zoom for the camera so it can be used for wildlife!  Glad I got one!

It is frustrating to take only 4 or 5 pictures and have the batteries have low or not enough charge to continue.  Not sure if it is the camera, the battery or operator error.  I have read and re-read manual and tried various changes but still have the loss of battery charge. Disappointed in this because the Coolpix has all the features I was looking for but now am reconsidering Nikons and will return to Olympus brand.

$review_text.: I read of lot of reviews before I bought these and I noticed that people with smaller cars complained about weak bass andpeople with larger vehicles seemed to like them better. I may be wrong but could the door act as a box? Maybe the larger doorslike ones on a Tahoe have more bass? That is how it appears from the reviews. I put mine in my trailblazer and I really love them.They don't have earth shaking bass, But more that I expected from a 6.5&amp;#34; speaker.

$review_text.: This is the best MP3 and audiobook player, and a whole lot more.But this 2GB is actually more expensive than the 4GB and nearly the same price as the 8GB so take a look there.Here is my review of my 16GB:This is the best audiobook player. I also have an Ipod 80GB Classic and had a Zen Vision M. It leaves both for dead.- superb sound quality.- excellent bookmark function- 256 bookmarks. It returns to the bookmark and continues to the follwing tracks (unlike Zen which just stops, as do many other players, and windows mobile players).- the touch screen is very nifty and the smart menus pop up nicely. Navigation quickly became intuitive.- the standard folder structure makes loading books and tracks very simple. I am over Itunes and do not miss it.- 16GB or 8GB or 4GB of internal memory, then an SD slot which means you can have as many SD cards as you want. bookmarks work on the current SD card no worries.- excellent for music albums.- the video function works well when I test it, although I am not interested in using it routinely.If you're looking for the best portable audiobook player, you've found it. But if you just want to listen to audiobooks on your computer get ViddyMP3 for free. Or if you want to tinker get Rockbox free software for various portable players. I think the D2 is great for music too as its sound is clearly superior to Ipod and Zen to even my untrained ear.It does not do playlists, but really who needs them? I mainly used to use them to work around Itunes bugs.(maybe I like compilation albums, but I can just compile a folder of MP3's any way I like).Wishlist- on the fly erase &amp; click for more details on the bookmarks (but still the best for bookmarks), playlists (OK already).Tips- use the stylus supplied for navigating the touch screen.- when you first ever turn it on, be careful as the first thing you do is set language and I accidentally clicked Korean!! It took a while to return it to English, ha ha.- If you're not sure just buy the 4GB Black version only </review_text><review_summary>Works as advertised</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2ILRXF8UANCJD"><latest_review_date>14/03/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004DVEW8I</product_id><review_date>14/03/2014</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Best of the GF series</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2"><latest_review_date>24/05/2011</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B005HEUUEA</product_id><review_date>24/05/2011</review_date><review_helpful>[1, 2]</review_helpful><review_text>I have it set to transfer photos instantly from our Canon Rebel T2i DSLR, to iPad Mini, to Mac Mini.

When the day is over - back at the dorm room, all the files are simply copied to the laptop. The 1 TB is more disk space then needed for the whole 4 year program! Oh and did I mention, she loves the red cover.....!

 The old RCA I got in 2001 finally crapped out and I wanted a cheap replacement


 I chose to pay a little extra for the Sony (I've always been a fan of their products) over the Magnavox since I am dissatisfied with the few Magnavox things I own


 I wasn't aware this was a rebadge of a Phillips according to another reviewer
 That does surprise me
 But it's pretty good nonetheless.Over the last week or so I have used the hell out of it while taking some time off work


 Build quality is fairly sturdy


 Retail discs and at least 6 different brands of burned discs all worked well without a single error and all had a reasonable load time
 The text &amp; display menus are a little crude but that's to be expected of a cheaper player


 Surprisingly it has a rather wide range of settings/options
 It does have a front time display which alot of the cheapies don't
 The remote is OK but it lacks the zoom button that I like to use

 Remote response seemed fairly prompt
 I don't have any major complaints about it

$REVIEW.: I just received this from Amazon.com

 These are my initial impressions.1
It takes 16 hours for the first charge of the batteries, so don't plan on using them the first day you receive it.2
I was disappointed by the loud hum/hiss you hear during periods of silence
 I really didn't notice it when music was playing (or while watching movies), but there was quite a roar after the song ended (MP3s playing on a HTPC)

 I played around with positioning of the transmitter, but it didn't seem to matter

 I also tried changing the headphone channel to no avail..

at least not at first


 I just started playing around with the channel switch again and it did seem to help quite a bit.3


The range is SUPER!  My HTPC is in the basement on one side of the house and my bedroom is upstairs on the other side of the house..
very good reception even at that distance

 My Linksys wireless router can't even work that far

I can go anywhere in the house.4

The headphones are very comfortable and VERY good at isolating you from  virtually all room noise..
even with my son cranking up the 12" subwoofer during videogaming

 My wife thinks they'll be great for isolating her from the household din even when the headphones are turned off.5
If you want an extra set of headphones to use with this system, you might as well just buy another complete package..


the additional headphones without the transmitter is only about </review_text><review_summary>Tripod</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2J811I8ALGPIG"><latest_review_date>27/06/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B002LE8BJA</product_id><review_date>27/06/2012</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>great stuff, and very good customer service [3 months of constant use]</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2J8T58Z4X15IO"><latest_review_date>24/03/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004XXQI1U</product_id><review_date>24/03/2012</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>SkyFi2</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2J96FILPQA01"><latest_review_date>11/03/2011</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004S5CCP4</product_id><review_date>11/03/2011</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>I just got this today along with the M510 wireless mouse

When I first plugged in the keyboard, it was recognized right away


I turned on the mouse but I couldn't get the mouse pointer to move


I checked the batteries and all seemed fine
Finally, after plugging my USB mouse back in, I went to the Logitech site and discovered there is "Unifying" software that has to be downloaded and installed

Once I did that, the mouse and keyboard worked fine from one USB bluetooth dongle.Overall, the keyboard is very nice
It's very thin yet very solid feeling

The key action is like the keys on my Macbook Air pretty much - a bit different than my old iMac keyboard that this is replacing but I like it


I do have a few slight gripes that together, make me subtract one star from a perfect rating.First, the function keys are setup like a Macbook in that the function keys do double duty
The F1 - F4 keys also do the screen brightness Up/Down, Expose, and Dashboard , F7 - F9 do media rewind, play/pause, and FFW, and F10 - F12 do Mute, Sound down, Sound Up


To use these, you have to hold down the Fn key (which replaces the Help key on the iMac keyboard (which I never used))
Not a big deal because you can remap the function keys in Sys Prefs anyway but something to note

I guess the only thing is the loss of dedicated Volume keys above the number pad like I had on the iMac keyboard.Next, as others have noted, the feet that raise the back of the keyboard up seem very flimsy

Hopefully, they won't break but I'm not holding my breath.Finally, it's not clearly shown in the photos but the black model has a white ring around the edge

The pictures on Amazon are taken against a white background so it's easy to miss but I was expecting an all black keyboard to somewhat match my case.Other than those gripes, I like it.

They match up very well, though the user must decide how to match the colors, as these have a purple section but not an orange section. My answer is to put my red discs in the purple cases and my orange discs in the red cases. Looks good to me.

If all you care about is a BT keyboard and mouse to do the basics it's ok. It does the job.But it comes with extra bells and whistles that can be useful if you know how to use them.My 3-star rating is for a couple flaws that require this to go thru another redesign.1. The legs that swivel out from the near the back corners are flimsy and the weakest link on this design. I had my first keyboard all of a few days and one of the legs broke off. Today someone else in the office with this exact same model of keyboard had one of their legs break off.  I am sure that others will experience the same unless you either don't swivel them out (have the keyboard lay flat on the surface) or baby care for this fragile design of the legs.2. The keyboard has a LCD of sorts display. It is pathetic.a. It is so dim you can hardly read it.b. Trying to figure out how to set the date/time is a royal pain, at least for me. I am running Linux Mint 14 and a VMWare Workstation v8 with Win 7. Prior to running that setup I had just Win 7 running as my OS. I got the keyboard date/time set after some pain. It continued to work after I got a new workstation and configured as first described, with Linux and Win 7 in a VM. Then one day the batteries needed replacing. I changed them and the date/time now need reseting. I can not get it to set. They have a menu for the display but no mention of date/time is mentioned anywhere. I had to go to their website Support and find an article on how to set the date/time. It involves installing SetPoint. I did that and it has no mention of date/time either. The instructions say it will just automatically set. Wrong, not for me. I restarted Win 7. I restarted the VM. Nothing makes a difference. Why Logitech couldn't just offer an option in the provided keyboard menu to Set Date/Time and let you type it in and Apply is beyond me. They obviously want to sync it to the system clock but that isn't automatically working either.c. I find the display useless to me.

I had endless hassles with the holder falling down during a drive from the window. The original holder uses a suction action. With the power cable hanging from it, that makes it less stable on climate changes and a safety concern while driving. Not to mention, I have an LMT2555 so having it fall all the time makes it easier to break my GPS investment. This holder sits stable on top of the dashboard and somehow barely moves. It can rotate by control but doesn't do it during the drive. Also, this holder is stable. It's my second one so obviously I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I received mine today. So far, I love it! I will be using it mostly as an e-reader, and I was concerned about that. I actually like it much better than my Touch as an e-reader. My two favorite things are the page turns (you can turn a page slowly) and the select a word feature. You get the definition and more options. Of those, the option I love (the Touch didn't have it) is to search the book for other instances of the word. If I don't remember who a character is, I just touch and hold their name, choose options, and search. Up come the instances of that word, with a short part of the context following. This can even be expanded. On the Touch, you get the definition, but nothing else.I don't think reading will give me eye strain.As far as the web surfing, it seems that the connection is actually faster than my computer.Of course, the screen look is fabulous and the touch sensitivity is just right (better than my Touch).The only nit-picking I can think of is: it's heavier than my Touch,it has to be charged more often, you can't put books into collections, and it is a little difficult to find the on/off button. I'm getting a Mo-Ko cover, so I hope that will make it more convenient.I'm glad I bought this instead of the Paperwhite.I'll try to watch this for a couple of days in case there are questions I can hopefully answer.

It is, of course, pretty zippy in a USB 3.0 port, but even in 2.0 and 1.1 ports it is faster than others. My aunt noticed it, and said she wants one now, and her computer isn't even USB 3.0! It has been through the wash once, which may impress some, but most of the flash drives I own have been at some point, and all survived.For specifics in terms of speed, in real world usage I have seen read speeds around 130MB/s and write at around 40MB. These, of course, are peak speeds: unfortunately, when transferring, the speed will start maybe 20% under those speeds, get up to them, peak, and drop off. Still, the drive is extremely fast, and the fact that it can be hard to measure real world speeds because the file finishes transferring too fast should give you an idea of how this drive does.There are a couple of cons. First, as mentioned elsewhere, is the lack of indicator light. Also, even after 5 or 10 minutes of use, the drive gets quite warm. Neither of these issues are very concerning to me, but might be problematic for others and are therefore worth mentioning. All in all, this is a good, but not excellent flash drive.

$REVIEW.: This product is a great concept: Turn any camera into a wi-fi enabled photo uploader. In practice, it is not so good. The setup is complicated, the Eye-Fi tool on my Mac kept having major issues accessing the card when attempting to update the wi-fi networks, and the iOS app is a huge pain. In order to transfer photos to your iPhone/iPad, you need to mess with the iOS wi-fi settings and connect to an Eye-Fi &amp;#34;direct network&amp;#34; connection. For some reason, if both devices are set to connect to the same home wi-fi network, you can't seem to transfer photos to your device. You are also unable to set the card to share photos with more than one device. I had to choose to either sync with my Macbook or my iPhone, not both.This product was returned. If you need to transfer photos wirelessly, I would recommend purchasing a digital camera with the functionality built in.

For those of you who care about max speed, i get 83mbps with 5g in the same room (on a 100mbps connection)


A room away i get about 60-70 on the 5g


So this is pretty amazing
I live in a small college apartment so can't really shed light on the range etc
5G does get worse if you are more than a room away however, and then it is more effective to us the 2.4G band


I would suggest making it N only and 40mhz as this adds speed to the connection

Overall great.[...] - Link to the speed test

$review_text.: I am an ardent music lover, and for a long time I was looking for the  right cable to connect to my music mixer and amplifier. I had purchased the 1/4" adapters throught which I then connect the RCA connectors, it is a connection that works OK but I was not completely satisfied. Then I came across this product on Amazon and I purchased it immediately, it arrived quickly through my prime membership and it is working great. Thanks Amazon for making it possible to obtain any product that we the consumer may require on your website. You are the greatest.Glee. Trinidad W.I

$REVIEW.: These headphones came in a larger box because there was another item I had ordered in the same box

 Packaging was perfect and delivered on time
 I ordered these particular headphones because JVC is a trusted name and the reviews were mostly good


 I also wanted a pair with a single cord, not one to each side meeting in a Y to plug into my laptop

 These filled the bill nicely
 The only complaint I have is the piece that rests on the top of your head is hard plastic with no padding at all and after a short time it gets uncomfortable
 It would have been nice for them to pad that a little


 It wouldn't take much


 Other than that I love them
 The sound quality is great,  I would recommend them to anyone but would find a way to pad that upper piece some way


 I have it wrapped in a small cloth which is helping a lot.

Here's what we think of the camera so far:Pros:- Outdoor daytime pictures are stunning! Colors are bright and faithful to real-life and white balance is good at factory settings.- Large LCD screen with auto brightness in any lighting is a big plus. We never have trouble seeing the screen, even in bright light.- For such a small, purse-sized camera, we think it is plenty sturdy - just be sure to use the wrist strap, because it is easier to drop by nature of it's size - that's just basic physics!Cons:- Flash photography is just average - and the camera is pretty slow in very low light, even with flash.- Battery life is just average. You should get an extra battery - if you do, I would get a name brand, as generics don't hold charge and won't last as long as your original.Overall, for our use, we love this camera! We just wish it was a bit faster in low light and had a longer-lasting battery. Still, we highly recommend!

I found the optics only fair for normal birding especially at a distance and sent these back and bought the Nikon Prostaff 8x25's and they work way better for general birding and they fit your hands better and the big plus is the Nikon's are waterproof. About the same price as these at $110.00. Nikon just beats Pentax when it comes to optics. The exit pupil is only 2.47mm on these which is the aperture(21mm)divided by the magnification(8.5x). This means the cone of light entering your eye is very narrow so they require very careful eye placement on the eyepieces making them fussy to use. The Nikon 8x25 Prostaff has a 3.1mm exit pupil making them way easier to place your eye over the eyepiece and way less fussy to use. This small exit pupil is what makes most compacts hard to use plus they let in less light making them dim at dusk. The Nikon Prostaff's are also brighter for that reason than the Pentax's. Get the Nikon's for birding and you won't be sorry.
$review_summary.: There are better alternatives for compact birding binoculars.

$REVIEW.: A &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; look with that old time leather camera case look!  Takes me back 50 years (yes I am rather old) to my first Brownie and Pentax 35mm case!  The leather is thick enough to provide protection from the dings of swinging the camera and case from the shoulder.  The snaps seem secure enough for light to medium duty.  My only reason for a 4 Star rating is that I have to remove the camera from the case to access the miniUSB connection.  However, as the camera is wifi capable, the cable will not be an issue once (if ever) I figure out how to use the wifi feature on the Canon SX280 HS!  I would recommend this case, although perhaps not the color of the case (especially for younger trendy folks) highly.  Leave the retro stuff for me!

$review_text.: The fan came with a low noise adapter as well as an Ultra low noise adapter. Without an adapter, the fan runs at 1800 rpm, and 17 db, with the low noise adapter it runs at 1300 rpm and 10 db, with the ultra low noise adapter, it runs at 800 rpm and 7 db.I am currently running with the low noise adapter on and my system is about 3 feet from me, I can't tell if the fan is running or not.I am extremely satisfied. I will replace most of my system fans with this one.

$review_text.: The 70-300 G is definitely one of the least expensive lenses to get you to 300 mm, but there are some tradeoffs with the low price tag.  I've found my lens to be pretty soft throughout the zoom range (mine is soft even stopped down) and relatively slow to focus (D70).  The lens performs best in well lit environments and is capable of taking high quality pictures, but may require more post processing and effort than faster lenses to achieve these results.I bought the lens mainly to get the zoom range at an affordable price, but plan to replace it in the near future (probably will sell the lens).  The build quality isn't the best, but it is still pretty durable.  Recommended for beginning photographers or photographers on a budget (like myself), but others may be left wanting more.  Still, it is sold at a great price.

Both 2TB drives are still being sold with the same model number. Due to changes in serial nunbers, depth of the drive housing's indentation has now become the best way to distinquish the drives (see user images - bottom right of Amazon's product page)2) When I wrote this, I didn't feel up to offering an alternate drive recommendation, as my own opinion is based on personal experience and hence anecdotal. Many people asked, but I only answered in email, without adding a recommendation to the review.Since Backblaze's (an online data backup company) massive long term test, their blog and extremetech's article based on that (see comments, page 26 for a link), I'll just quote their blog: "If the price were right, we would be buying nothing but Hitachi drives. They have been rock solid, and have had a remarkably low failure rate."So, is that data even relevant for the average home user?  I would say yes, because continuous, heavy use of large numbers of drives is the only way to get any half-reliable comparison. Among consumers, usage patterns are simply spread too wide: if someone only turns on their computer 15 times a year (my aunt), any drive will be the same as any other drive, cause with so little use, they will all last till the lubricant in the spindle dries up, and she'll tell anyone who asks that her drive is great. This inability to compare reliability in the consumer space has bolstered sales of shoddy drives for a long time.If you do use your computer frequently, installing drives exhibiting a &amp;lt;1% annual failure rate at Backblaze certainly beats installing drives with a 15% or even 120% annual failure rate.**end update**ok, so this drive is listed as the "Seagate ST2000DM001" and guess what; other than that it sports 2 Terabytes, it tells you nothing whatever about what drive you'll end up with, because Seagate has chosen to obscure and omit relevant Data between different builds with vastly different performance.The short advice: Only purchase versions xxExxxxx [and possibly x24xxxxx - x24 is unverified info so far, see notes below] of the 2TB model. This uses 2 platters and 4 heads.It performs 30% better than the version with 3 platters, which has an xxFxxxxx [or possibly x36xxxxx] designation. Avoid those!You'll need to contact the seller and ask them to check the code on the drive. If they can't verify, don't buy it, better to get a drive from a different company, where its hopefully not a surprise game of what's in the box.S - SU - Suzhou ChinaW - WU - Wuxi ChinaZ - TK - Korat ThailandF = 3 platters with either 5 or 6 heads (bad 2TB drive or good 3TB drive)E = 2 platters with 4 heads. (good 2TB drive)D = 1 platter with 2 heads.  (good 1TB drive)Weight info received in a comment here, suggests that the 'good' 2-platter drive weighs 534 grams, while the 'bad' 3-platter drive weighs 624 grams.Seagate used to embed the information about their drives in the model number, but now they obscured it, so they can pawn off whatever they want.  Send a WxE model to Publications who test drives, and then ship the crappy WxF model to unsuspecting customers who may never realize they're not getting what they thought they were buying.  This should really be illegal.....NOTE 1:  This was written for the 2TB drive.  It turns out Amazon also shows this review for 3TB drives. This info does not apply to 3TB drives, the 3TB drives always have 3 1TB platters. (or not, there have been reports of 5 platter 3TB versions, if you know anything more, let us know).NOTE 2:  comparison test results - since links get killed in reviews, I'll upload an image to the product page..NOTE 3:  A relevant post on Seagate's forum stating that these Barracuda have been crippled through redesign [see the link in comment 143 below, page 15](Apparently, links are permitted in comments).NOTE 4:  Someone commented that Seagate removed any reference to the 2 platter version of this drive in the manual (something which is usually only read after the purchase).NOTE 5:  Someone explained that Seagate made this change due to the flooding of their plant in Thailand. This is not quite correct since chinese 2 platter 2TB drives are also in circulation..NOTE 6:  While the channel still has drives with the numbering scheme as described above, there appear to be at least some drives with a new numbering scheme like "Z240PJB3". Would be great if it read out like x24xxxxx, where 2 stands for 2 platters and 4 stands for 4 heads, then this would be one of the good drives while something like x35xxxxx would be the bad drives. (this is just a guess so far, its not verified).NOTE 7:  Someone added that 2 platter drives (based on other pictures) are 'thinner' with deeper indents on the bottom and top and have a dot matrix code on the bottom right third of the top next to the label. (note that labels are not safe indicators, as they could change an older factory to add barcodes or switch to their latest labeling system any time they wish).NOTE 8:  Seagate has reacted and added more drive info on this product page, advertising "POWER OF ONE" meaning 1 platter per terabyte. This is good news, but that doesn't mean you can relax and just hit the 'buy' button:a) channel inventory of drives manufactured prior to this "Power of One" initiative will be around for some time to come, so you still need to verify.b) the specifications sheet Seagate still links on this very page (as of June 28, 2013) shows 6 heads, 3 disks for the 2TB version. With conflicting information, its still a little hard to tell for consumers if they're getting "POWER OF ONE" or "WEAKNESS OF 0.67".Once Seagate "fixes" their spec sheet info for the 2TB drive which directly conflicts with the "Power of One" advertising, I'd be happy to change my conclusion below. After all, it would mean they decided to be honest and transparent again, rather than hell bent on destroying the reputation of their 'Barracuda' brand.But right now, what is the point of advertising "Power of One" while saying their 2TB drives have 3 platters with 0.67 TB at the same time....CONCLUSION:Seagate's real reason to obscure drive information is being able to use lower bin or older tech platters that can only hold ~670 GB, so they use 3 platters.  This is a fine business decision, but an honest company would give it a new Model number/name, as its a different product with lower speeds, lower reliability and higher weight.But why be honest, if you can cheat and make a few dollars extra per drive, by selling it under the same name as the better drive, which has been reviewed extensively and lauded for its higher speeds?Last Update: June 28, 2013 (in response to Seagate's new additions to this page and with thanks to Alex and J. Goodman)

$review_text.: It tested okay, meaning it powers on and all the numbers work out. I am unimpressed with the cables. There is one set of zip ties at the end of each cable and not near the opening on the PSU. The cables were scattered everywhere and it took a short while to untangle them. That was irritating. Never have I seen any power supply arrive without the cables being properly bunched and brought together with at least a second zip tie at the base of the cables. The main board cable (largest) has a nice cable wrap on it which makes the loose cables look even worse. What a pain, and the wires are all mixed up. I do not recommend unless you are on budget and this is NOT a true 600 watt power supply. Peaks about 380.

Second if you don't push the hood on all the way securely it can leave small gaps where light can show through. The one thing that I really didn't like is the construction of the hood it seems like a cheaper plastic which is disappointing Polaroid usually puts out top quality products never the less if your a very active photographer moving a round a lot this is probably not the lens hood for you a small bump or jar against the hood is all it takes for it to pop off.

$REVIEW.: I received these as a gift and have been very satisfied with them


 The sound is clean and clear and they just look cool

 I have had them for three years now and have had zero problems with them even moving them to and from college.The system does have a few quirks.-No power switch

 I thought this was odd, but for what ever reason Harmon/Kardon didn't design one on this set
 It does have a mute function
 Tap both volume buttons simultaneously and it prevents the annoying feedback you get when you unplug them from your computer

 I found this out on my own, which leads to my next gripe.-Poor instructions


 Most systems indicate left and right channels and explain functions and features


 I have noticed with other Harman products that while their instructions have excellent diagrams, they tend to lack much written instruction

 Which speaker is the left and which is the right?  And that mute function


 Not listed in the instructions.-Lastly, and this is just my observation, I think the subwoofer should have some kind of protection covering the vent port
 Has anyone ever dropped something in it?  Or wondered about debris getting inside?  I haven't had any problems with this, but it's just my observation and something I thought Harman should address.Overall, I have been very pleased with this set

 Again the sound is AWSOME!  But it does have a few quirks that could make or break a buyer's decision


 I do believe that anyone who buys these will be pleased.

$review_text.: I used this to hook a TV in an exercise room to the DirecTV receiver in our bedroom.  Our house has conduit running to all of the rooms so it was easy to run 2 CAT5e cables from our bedroom to the exercise room.  At first I ran 2 runs of approx. 70 feet and hooked it up, the picture was perfect but there was no sound.  I was able to cut around 10 feet off both runs and tried it again and it worked. (Perhaps with CAT6 cable it would work at 98 feet?)  So far it has worked great except it cuts out for a brief second whenever our air conditioner turns on.  I would buy it again.

$review_text.: This is my third Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combo

I bought the first years ago, and it died just before the warranty ran out
Logitech sent me a free replacement with very little hassle


Good customer service is important to me, so I decided to stick with the brand when the replacement finally died.The new model seems to fix just about all the minor problems I had with the first one
I love the compact feel and the low profile keys
The mouse is even faster and more accurate

Best of all, I've been using it for months on the original batteries (which was my main complaint for the first one)


Keyboards and mice are very personal items, but this one is exceptionally comfortable to me.One minor nag: the mouse can be switched between &amp;#34;freewheel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;click: mode using a small button behind the wheel

I love the feel of freewheel, but it is very difficult to locate the cursor accurately - it always seems to &amp;#34;recoil&amp;#34; just a bit when you try to stop
It's hard to explain, but when you're scrolling down a page, for example, and you stop, it scrolls back up a few lines before it comes to rest

As a result, I leave it in click mode (which functions exactly as the previous mouse did)

If it didn't have this one annoying problem, it would be practically perfect.

$REVIEW.: I have other SSDs from OCZ and Corsair that I installed myself, as well as an MBAir with either a Toshiba or Samsung SSD in it, and this Kingston is on par with all of them.  As the boot and program drive, it is fast and reliable.  Compared to running W7-64 off a HDD, there's no comparison.  Both PCs I built that use SSDs are just for casual use (web browsing, moderate gaming, Office suite) and for those tasks and programs this is perfect.  For those that run more demanding, resource-intensive software and require frequent reading/writing from this drive, it may not have the I/O to deliver, but I can't say.  But if you are just a typical computer user, upgrade to this SSD and you won't be disappointed.  I have this 120GB and that's more than enough room to house the OS and Office, plus games.  Probably could have even gotten away with a 60/64GB, but this was on sale and rebate when I bought from TD, so the 120GB was a no-brainer.

$review_text.: It looks nice, built well and even has small blue LED's that light up when ports are used. I am happy with this purchase in that aspect. . .HOWEVER. . .The power cable is almost unacceptably tiny. I would hate to steer away sales from this item because of how well it fulfills my other needs but, man, my wall outlet is MAYBE 4 feet away and the cable doesn't even get to the plastic outlet covering, much less to the plug.I would tell you what voltage the plug is, but I just realized it is not printed anywhere on the plug or the hub. Being a gadget freak I have tons of old power cords but I can't see which one I need to use to replace the baby one.Soooooo. . . it's a superb hub if you don't need alternate power. Lucky for me my external is self powered.

$REVIEW.: I only owned this camera for one night, so all I can give it is one star
 After taking a few snapshots, which looked good on the LCD, it froze
 Don't know why


 After getting it powered down by pulling the battery, I tried again
 Took a couple of shots and it blinked off

 The screen relighted momentarily with the code E16 displayed


 Went through several repetitions before calling it a night


 Recharged battery the next morning, hoping it was just a battery or memory card problem
 At that point it was unusable


Called Canon (Saturday morning)
 After a short discussion and talk through, the tech said, "Your camera is defective."  That was enough for me

 I returned it via Fedex for credit, and now I'm looking for something else because when I tried to find out about E16, I found out about E18  I don't know how many "E"s they have (at least 18, I guess), so I don't think it's a good idea to try another one of these little jewels

 It's a shame though


 I loved the design, and I think the photos would have been nice
 Perhaps the Sony Cybershot or the Casio is a little better quality
 Maybe the Olympus

 The new Nikon S4 looks great, but it doesn't look pocket-sized, so I'm floundering here.

$REVIEW.: The reviews are right! You can use this instead of the more expensive unit with your LCD or LED Samsung TV. I was able to insert mine into USB Port 1, turn on the television, and connect to my network in about 2 minutes flat. No updates or upgrades or waiting needed to make it work perfectly. Highly recommended!9/6/2012 EDIT and UPDATEWhen using this with your TV if you get occasional drops in signal where the whole show turns off and you can no longer connect to the internet without rebooting the TV, be sure to manually specify the IP address on the wireless connector. It's under Setup and Network Settings. This solved the issue I was having intermittently. It's a great product and works well under Wireless N. I still give it 5 stars.5/19/13 EDIT and UpdateThis is a horrid product. I eneded up purchasing a Rosewill USB wifi LAN adapter because this one could never hold the wifi signal. The new rosewill unit never fails and works as planned, not to mention it was cheaper. Just skip this product, it's total garbage.

$REVIEW.: Like most people I tried cheaper Toslink selector switches before this one. They ALL failed! It is a bit pricey;but you won`t be sorry! I`ve had mine for 8 months and have used all the inputs/outputs hundreds of times with perfect performance! The remote is a real nice option. I don`t have to lift my dead a- - off the chair. I would recommend this product!

$REVIEW.: Since I use this for my Stormtrooper armor the speaker has to be in my chest area and the mic is in my helmet. I have no been able to produce a good loud volume without it making a loud squeal but that is my fault. If you're planning on attaching this to your waist it is the best price you'll find anyway.A good product perfect for a on-waist application.

$REVIEW.: There's been a plethora of reviews already, addressing specs and then comparing attributes, but I thought I've give a little perspective to those who shoot similar to me.On paper, let's be honest, the 5Dmk3 doesn't seem all that more impressive than theCanon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), and then compared to theNikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)- it looks like a perfect storm against the 5Dmk3.I typically used a pair of Canon 7D's (and sometimes a Canon XHA1 as an additional back-up against corrupt files on the 7D bodies before the 1.2.5 firmware update) to shoot video. Fine video, with a crop sensor (helped in recording speeches or wedding nuptials from the back of church, etc), didn't downconvert HDMI out to monitor to 480p like the 5Dmk2 when you pressed record. Of course there were the typical Canon SLR problems, the moire - aliasing, and the approximate 12-minute recording time limit. And of course, a 7D is only decent in low light.I recently needed to purchase some additional bodies, or camcorders, which would have:-longer record time than 12 minutes-be much better about moire - aliasing-be tapeless (I know, shame on me for being so late in making sure that even my backup is tapeless)-be better than decent in lowlight-beneficial if it could use EF lenses-would be nice if they could take good pictures (this last one was strictly because I take business pictures as a filler for cash from time to time and fill in as a second photo shooter in weddings when I'm not taking video)I used a 5Dmk2 on shoots from time to time, but had not owned one. I thought about going thePanasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black)along with a 5Dmk2, since it seemed the differences between the mk2 and mk3 were not so great, but there was enough of a price difference to make me wonder what the big deal was.But I was also really impressed with Black Magic Design's Cinema Camera from this year's NAB show, which could be purchased with an EF mount. However, it wouldn't be released until the end of July, and I needed to purchase before June.I settled on the 5Dmk3 over the 5Dmk2+Panasonic GH2 option and the Nikon d800 option.And I'm very glad that I did.Pros:+30 minute record time (well, 29:29 - for tariff purposes, if you don't already know why the strange record limit)+Fixed moire - aliasing issue (Well, made it much better. It can still show up in certain angles with certain patterns, but I see it maybe once a wedding shoot)+clean ISO up to 3200, very usable at 6400, okay at ranges higher than that+Full-frame is just so nice, compared to crop, micro 4/3, or Black Magic Design's almost micro 4/3 chip+Much better pictures than the 7D+Headphone jack for monitoring+CF and SD/SDHC card use+Didn't have to sell my EF glass and re-invest in Nikon glass to go with a d800 or additional issues using EF lenses on the GH2 bodyCons:-Not as sharp as a d800, but usable, clean sharpness can be added in post, and far more superior in lowlight than the d800. (I recommend a d800 if you are always in a studio setting, but if you do more event or run-and-gun style shooting, the ISO range is a must)-Dynamic range doesn't seem to be as good as d800, but once again, shoot with a neutral profile, or Technicolor Cinestyle profile, and fix in post-Initial price-30 minute record time (I put it in the cons as well because some events may need continuous shooting of 30 minutes or more)-On board sound recording (I put this here because it's still not phenomenal. It's decent. And that works fine sometimes. But not all the time. Same with any SLR body, though.)To be honest, the 5Dmk3 fixes so many headaches that I was having using the 7D as my main video choice, headaches that would not have been resolved with just the 5Dmk2. The d800, which takes beautiful pictures, is a fantastic camera except in one very crucial area, lowlight. Even though it starts out with a brighter image at its low ISO levels than the 5Dmk3, the noise is atrocious as you increase ISO, even with noise-reduction software. A beautiful love affair can be had with the d800, I will say definitely say. And to all the GH2 fanboys, there are so many good things about the GH2, but it really felt like a trade-off compared to the 7D. It's like those bodies, the 7D and GH2, complimented each other greatly in that where one was weak, the other fixed, but in turn was weak where the other was strong. (If that makes sense.)I purely wanted to upgrade to fix issues. The 5Dmk3 has proven to not be deficient to where I would need the 7D, or another camera body, to fill some gap.I've had zero buyer's remorse from this purchase. And I can't say that about many purchases.Rating: 4.5 StarsPrice knocks it down to 4 StarsBut because I love using it, 5 Stars - I know, all crushes are 5 stars when they first start out... so it's really a 4 - 4.5 Star product

$REVIEW.: It was a challenge to get set up with ATT/Bellsouth.  I'm not sure why, but I had to re-enter my username (email address) and network password (call to get it, it's not your email password) several times before it finally just started working.  The status screen said everything was good.  But internet wasn't working.I've come back and knocked off stars because of the bad implementation of port forwarding.  When on the main "local" screen, sometimes all connected devices show and sometimes not.  There's no rhyme or reason to it, wireless or wired doesn't seem to matter.  To set up port forwarding, the router has to recognize what devices are connected.  There's no option, as on other routers, to just tell it an IP address.  It requires that it "see" the device.  And since this is buggy, it's not possible to set up port forwarding to some devices.  When going to the Security tab with port forwarding or the My Network tab, there is no way to forward a port that is on the network, fully working, but that the router isn't seeing for whatever reason.I've found reference to this same problem from others on Google.
$review_summary.: Works with Bellsouth/ATT

But Buggy Port Forwarding.

$review_text.: My wife and I own two Casio Exilim cameras that use the NP-20 battery.  Within a month, the first battery was bad.  Attempting to charge it results in a flashing red light, which is an error condition indicating the battery will not charge.  A few weeks later, the second battery was dead too.  Casio did send us two replacements for free, and acknowledged having trouble with these particular batteries.  After 6 months, one of the replacements died.  Another call to Casio, and thankfully they provided another replacement.So we've had 5 of these batteries, and 3 were defective.  We don't use the cameras often.  We checked all the batteries using both of our charging docks, and confirmed in each case that yes, the battery was the problem and not the charger.Casio has treated us well and acknowledged the problem, though.  My recommendation is to call for replacements on they day you buy a camera that uses this battery -- you're going to need them.

$review_text.: Although this a good replacement battery it is much like the original. It lacks battery life - Maybe I cannot blame the battery, maybe it is the laptop itself. However, I'd rather be able to use my laptop without needing a cord at all times sense my original battery was completely dead and would not take a charge. I still need to bring the cord with me even around the house because like I said it doesn't hold a charge for as long as I'd like.I do some extensive things. I tend to run a lot of programs at once as I am an amateur web developer. I would recommend this product to anyone with battery troubles - but don't expect much more than the original battery...

$review_text.: My original review is at the bottom, however since writing it I have returned the product for an exchange. Kudos to amazon as usual it was a quick and painless process. The second unit they sent me works great with 0 flickering problems. It seems that perhaps bizlink had a bad batch or just shoddy QA at the factory.-------------------- Original Review-------------------If you go to [...]you will see all the issues people are having. It is a BizLink adapter rebranded (also the same as the dell or sapphire) and unfortunately if you are pushing high resolutions in eyefinity it has the dreaded screen flicker in most cases. In my case the screen is actually flickering 50% of the time and is unusable. This might be an ATI problem and not an Accel one but his product is listed as "approved hardware for eyefinity" by ATI yet fails to function properly in a majority of cases.Spare yourself the trouble get a display with built in displayport functionality, if this is not fixed in the next version of catalyst I am returning this product if I can.

$review_text.: No isolation, the sound bleeds out through vents on the earcups, and you can clearly hear everything just as loud when you have it on as if you don't have something covering your ears.There's no point in buying and using these, why not just use speakers, it's practically the same amount of noise both ways in and out from the headphones to your environment.The 2nd gripe is that the earcups are a bit small, they go on your ears instead of covering around them, so after some usage, my ears feel some pain as the earcup cushions press against them for too long.3rd, the sound quality have some issues when there are high pitch notes, it starts frizzing instead of playing the high pitch notes correctly, Huge disappointment.

$review_text.: I used my ASUS tablet for a week before the dock arrived, and while I was very happy with my tablet before I used the dock, I think far more of the device as a set than I did as just a tablet.  Now, if I'm not needing a tablet, I can connect it to the dock, and literally go all day using the device.  I did a "intense use day" test on it, and literally ensured that the screen stayed on all day... and at the end of 10 hours, I still had 32% battery life left... which I thought was impressive!I've had the dock for 2 weeks now, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!  Here are my observations...I have no idea what the other folks are talking about with the device randomly turning off WiFi or not working when in "dock mode".  ASUS did an automatic update a few days after the dock arrived... maybe that patched whatever problem there was, because I have had no issues at all.The Docking Mechanism is firm - very firm.  The lock is very secure, and the hinge is quite tight.  The tablet weighs more than the keyboard, but the hinge also serves as a platform, so if the surface is relatively flat, it works fine.The weight is a bit less than the tablet, it seems to me, so it about doubles the weight of the device, but its worth it.  With the dock attached, it still weighs less than my netbook.The glidepad is very sensitive, and I tap it with my thumbs while typing from time to time.  Sort of wish there was a delay setting where it turns off if you're typing.  Maybe there is, but I haven't found it.  (My only negative, actually)A nice thing about the glidepad is that its multi-touch, which is an awesome feature, I think.The keyboard is laid out very well, and the dedicated keys are a big plus.The mouse pointer on the tablet when docked is a ring... it looks like the "busy" pointer on Windows 7, which took a bit to get used to.The USB ports work perfectly, and attaching a portable hard drive worked perfectly.  The SD slot is very handy, also.  I used it to charge my phone, which was pretty cool.email is way more functional, as are documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.Again, the sum of the parts is outweighed by the two together... it really turned my tablet into a completely useable tool!  It basically replaced my netbook, and I'm a die-hard windows guy.jb

$REVIEW.: this acer is my first adventure into chromebooks. i was aware going in, that the chromebook is a very stripped-down experience, basically a chrome browser window and the apps available from the chrome store. however, with the ever-expanding selection of chrome apps and a very ambitious linux universe, this browser-in-a-box can do so much more.first, let's talk about the machine itself. some have argued that this acer is basic and plain, even boring. i'm not the type who feels the need to express my creativity through the hardware i buy, so this is of no concern to me. what i do concern myself with is functionality. compared to the other chromebooks in this price range, the acer offers far more functionality than its competitors. with two usb ports, hdmi, sd card, and bluetooth, i don't feel like i'm missing anything connectivity-wise that i wouldn't normally get with a regular laptop (but for a fraction of the price). the design is not going to win any awards, but i like the clean, basic look. it doesn't distract you from what's under the hood and on the screen.speaking of under the hood, this thing smokes. with the haswell-based processor, 4gb of ram, and integrated graphics, everything i have thrown at it has been handled nicely. the screen is 720hd, and looks very good in most lighting conditions. the keyboard does not look and feel cheap to me, although others have made that comment. the only thing i've missed with this custom keyboard is the absence of home and end buttons (which may still be buried somewhere). my trackpad also does not click or rattle as others have mentioned. i've never been a fan of trackpads, and i'm still not sure if i like this one or not, but the two-finger controls are very handy in the absence of a regular mouse.now, for chrome os. for being as new to the game as this operating system is, it feels very polished and is maturing nicely. there are still a few functions that aren't as intuitive as i'd like. for instance, it should be easier to remove apps from the drawer on bottom. also, the ability to change ownership accounts is missing, and requires a full device reset instead. while these issues will likely be addressed in future software releases, they are a bit annoying right now. however, these shortcomings are generously compensated for, with the additional functionality offered through the chrome store. one of my favorite apps thus far is remote desktop. it's very easy to set up and even easier to connect. for a person who only has a desktop in his home, this allows me to take my desktop with me to the couch or the basement! add a chromecast accessory, and my hdtv turns into a desktop monitor. easy!one of the centerpieces of the chromebook (imo) is the ability to share and edit various documents through google drive. the google drive office suite, including docs, spreadsheet, and presentation, offers free versions of the office programs we've all used for the last 20+ years. the google versions are stripped out somewhat, but still offer most of the regular functionality you'd expect. also, the google office products are compatible with most standard office file types, including microsoft, openoffice, and libreoffice (with the addition of an extension). and when you're ready to store your documents, google drive offers you free cloud storage. this is key, because there's a very limited amount of onboard storage with the acer. i've been using drive for well over a year now. i use it to keep inventory spreadsheets updated at my bar, and also to make changes to tracking documents for my coin collection and my ingress user activities. all these things are accessible from my desktops at home and work, and my android phone, and any changes are automatically and instantly synced across all those devices. adding in the chromebook has given me an interface that's easier to use than my android for making changes, and obviously more portable than my desktops. not to mention cheaper, lighter, and longer-running than a standard laptop.another option i have added is the installation a linux distro (gnome gui with raring), which actually makes this chromebook an (almost) fully-functional linux laptop. with the limited onboard storage of only 16gb, my linux install must remain pretty light, but there is also a storage upgrade coming out soon for this acer. with 64gb or even just 32gb, this machine becomes much more versatile in that area.bottom line. this is a superb alternative to the still pricey laptop experience. for casual use, such as web browsing, streaming tv, and basic office productivity, this acer will do just about everything you will need. it also doubles as a cheap, yet powerful linux device. and chrome os will only get better over time, with new apps and software updates for free. why not give it a try?

I carry it around when I am very busy and it starts playing a meeting at inappropiate times. I think it should have had an off switch like my other Olympus digital voice recorder. I almost wanted to send it back but I find myself trying not to press the buttons that activate the last recording. It may be the case that came with it that is the problem because if fits so snug that it does not take much to activate a previous recording.

It's about 10.5 inches long, so you will need some space on your desktop.The front eject button is touch-sensitive, so don't make the mistake I did and press it hard.PowerDVD 10 software is included, and it can play Blu-ray and even Blu-ray 3D movies.They offer a discount to upgrade, for only $39 you can get the latest and greatest PowerDVD 12 Ultra.I have burned a Blu-ray data disc and it works fine, the write speed is about 20 MB/sec on Verbatim 6X BD-R media. So to burn a full 25 GB Blu-ray disc will take about 20-25 minutes.  Not too bad!Ok so that's all the good stuff.NOW FOR SOME COMPLAINTS:-An eSATA bracket is included, but the cable is only 11 inches long, too short for my motherboard. Most eSATA brackets that you buy have 18 to 24 inch cables.-PowerDVD 10 software can play back DVD movies that have been ripped to the hard drive, but it cannot play back Blu-ray movies that are on the hard drive.  I know for a fact that PowerDVD 11 allows this.-The OEM PowerDVD 10 software has lots of ads and 'click here to upgrade' buttons all over the place.-The power switch on the back is ridiculous!  It's a small slider switch that's recessed into the back of the case, plus it's located between the power jack and eSATA cable, and there's no room for your finger.  What a poor design.  Hey LG, charge us 50 cents more and put a proper rocker switch back there!  It never ceases to amaze me when a product is worthy of 5 stars, and then they make stup1d, obvious m1stakes like this.

After connected, the sound is crispy, clear and the controls (Play, pause, foward, back) are excelent.Excelent option if you don't like to deal with cables and a limited range of motion.The sight range is awersome, i tested it and it's connected with an excelent sound quality on a 20 mts. range.The only bad thing is it drains a bit faster the ipod battery, it only last on my ipod maximum 8 continous hours. When using it with a cord earphone, last more than 16 hours.If you have an ipod touch (From the 2nd generation) or an iphone, is useless buying this.

$REVIEW.: The Zoo-Tunes Portable Mini Character Speaker is cute and gets noticed by folks - my tweens and teens and their friends, all liked it.PRO: When hooked up to our smartphones it gives them a nice "boombox" effect and when you unplug it you hear a considerable difference in the playback from the phone speaker system on its own.CON: However, when used with our laptops, most of which fall into a moderate price range, there is no noticeable difference in the sound.  You can hear the sound playing through the speaker when you listen to it up-close but it doesn't add to or amplify the sound system in these laptops and there is no noticeable difference in the playback when you unplug the speaker. If you had a truly awful sound system, it might make a difference but not in the ones we have and we didn't buy laptops with tremendous sound systems to start with.POSSIBLE CON: The phone does not come with the needed USB cord so we used it with the 3 triple A batteries instead and they worked well.  This is not a huge issue for us as the speaker is for occassional use, not regular play, but the price of the cord and the need to secure one separately, should enter into your consideration if you are going to use this speaker daily.

I'd been on the fence about upgrading, having read some reviews about failure rates, DOA products, etc. I came across a few articles talking about Intel's quality being worth it even though the SSD by them was more expensive. I decided to try the 520 240 gb reseller kit (reseller kit comes with the hardware to mount onto a desktop).I'm amazed by how quickly Windows 7 boots up! I went with a fresh install, and kept my old traditonal hard drive as a secondary internal hard drive. I only have the OS and a few Steam games installed on the SSD. I've noticed faster load times for the games plus massive speed increases in general OS operations.The only downside is all the windows updates with a fresh install...took forever, but now that it's up and running I love the SSD.

 This one is hands-down the best one of the bunch, and &amp;#34;premium ultra thin&amp;#34; means exactly that - premium quality, and it IS ultra-thin


 With other protectors (that were much cheaper) the keyboard protector also left imprints on the screen, and I was weary of seeing this one doing the same - but, surprise! - it does not, so it IS super-thin and does not seem to collect the oil from fingers as readily

 Overall, I am a super-happy camper, and considering buying one more - just in case

(I have a special, compartmentalized backpack for my camera and research tools.  It's not a Pelican product.)The foam had no odor when I opened the packaging. That's a plus for me, because I hate plastic-y smells. Also, the foam cuts easily and is perfect for padding your camera, lenses, light meter, or other tools you're carrying.It's just firm enough.  It'll cushion my camera and other equipment if the backpack is jostled or even dropped, and the foam springs back to its original shape, immediately.I'm probably ordering a second foam set because this set wasn't quite enough for all the spaces in my backpack, but that's because I carry a lot of small devices for my field work.If you're looking for an affordable way to buy high-quality foam for padding delicate equipment in a backpack or luggage, this is an excellent choice.

Before the unlock this cpu was already blazingly fast at 3.0ghz 4 core it can handle simultaneous gaming and watching a movie on up to 3 screens dependent on video card
This thing is outstanding prior to any tinkering

So that is the first part of my review for stock cpu buyers it defeats the i3 but not quite the i5.Overclockers:First try overclocked this thing to 3.6ghz I DIDNT EVEN UP THE VOLTAGE and using the mobos (M59A7 i suggest the EVO) turbo boost technology in sync with amd overdrive I got this thing up to 4 ghz well 3.998 but close enough lol.Hidden Cores: Once again my used my mobo and it automatically unlocked 2 additoinal cores so this thing turned into a 6 core processor so easy

I currently have the 6 core unlocked version of this cpu running at 3.7ghz so not bad for a 4 core 3.0ghz cpu.Note: Unlocking cores is mobo dependent some mobos wont allow it so choose wisely

$REVIEW.: I previously purchased and installed another touch-screen shield.  It worked and stopped the glare, but I couldn't get the bubbles out.  The Clear Touch Ultra touch-screen shield installs easily without the bubbles.  It is good for removing glare, and finger prints are not as noticeable.  The images on screen remain just as clear and sharp.  And it  comes with items to clean the screen before installation, and a microfiber cloth to wipe off dust and finger prints after it is installed.If you have an Amazon 7&amp;#34; Kendal Fire HD, and you're fussy like me, then this is the touch-screen shield for you.  If little bubbles on the screen don't bother you, buy one of the cheaper ones.  If glare doesn't bother you, don't waste your money.  The Gorilla Glass on this Kindle screen can take a lot of abuse and still shine like new.

$REVIEW.: The image is high definition, and it does everything I want it to. My only complaint is that the menu is a little cumbersome to get around, but once you get use to it, it's not too bad. The mount is not a really good design, there is no locking mechanism so it's easy to knock it off the mount, but for the price, you can't beat it.

But that excitement turned quickly to disappointment when I switched it on for the first time and found a pinhead size white spot in the center of the display. I don't know how many dead pixels are involved here, but the light shining through is noticeable from several feet away. Had those dead pixels been on the perimeter it wouldn't have been as bad. But appearing almost dead-center makes them all the more distracting.I called Toshiba Support today to complain and the experience was distasteful. I was put on hold for 21 minutes to start. Then, after Chad came on and listened to my complaint I was put on hold for several minutes twice again while he checked with somebody. Finally, Chad came back on to say that dead pixels of the size I described were not covered by the warranty. When I suggested that it was not just the size but the placement and the visibility of the dead pixels Chad simply restated Toshiba's policy to me: small numbers of dead pixels are not covered by the Toshiba waranty. I then asked if there was a local Toshiba rep I could take the frame to for verification that the dead pixels in this case greatly diminished the frame's viewing experience. The answer was 'No!'Now I'm experienced enough with digital displays to know that the occasional dead pixel is simply part of the cost of our new technology. In fact, I have one on the 23" monitor I'm using right now. But a single dead pixel in the margin of my 23" screen is hardly noticeable. On the other hand, a pin-head sized cluster of dead pixels square in the center of a 10" frame - shining white light continuously - is another matter entirely. And any Toshiba exec who saw it would know that this particular frame should have been trash-caned before it ever left the factory.After my conversation with Chad it occurred to me that he had never even asked my name or for the serial number of the frame. Odd. That leaves me to believe that he answered my call knowing in advance that he'd have no need for that information. Get it? Seems obvious to me now that when a complaint comes in on the Frames line the responding rep is predisposed to say 'No!'In fairness, in my brief experience with it, the frame appeared to live up to all the things that had me excited about it in the first place EXCEPT for those dead pixels. So, should you buy one that is picture perfect I'm sure you will enjoy it. Perhaps my problem is the rare exception. Perhaps...

For some reason they used a micro usb port instead of a mini usb (micro usb is mostly used for phones where space is very limited). Most of us have mini usb cables lying everywhere. But micro usb is less common.2. The port is VERY tight, you need to use an excessive amount of force to plug in the cable. The cable also doesn't go all the way in, it goes in about 3/4 of the way. Also, the port itself is kind of loose. The connection with the cable is very tight, but the connection to the drive is kind of loose. Makes it feel like it usb port will break after more uses.3. The usb cable is very short about 1 foot.4. Formated as NTFS, had to reformat to FAT so MAC and linux can write to it.But overall, it's a pretty good drive. Actually shows up as 750GB in Disk Util on a Mac (don't know about windows...). And there's no crapware on it.

$review_text.: Since this item has been reviewed pretty extensively, I'll just summarize my likes and dislikes when it comes to the Belkin FastFit Bluetooth Keyboard with cover:Like:* Good keys, nice tactile response, decent size for an iPad-sized keyboard.* Easy pairing, no trouble getting it to work.* Attractive as a screen cover
Matches the back of the iPad.* Magnetic latch is pretty cool.* Multiple grooves allow multiple positions.* Battery life is excellent.Dislike:* Provides zero protection for back of iPad, and not very accommodating to various types of back protection.* Doesn't actually secure the iPad into the groove, like the Logitech version does.* Provides no actual connection between iPad and keyboard/case

Someone could just walk by and grab your iPad easily in public while you're typing.* Keyboard layout is a bit strange, and really not made for touch-typists; Most notably the tiny right-shift key.* Belkin doesn't advertise a back protector to go with this, making the quest to protect the iPad's back a blind one.* A little bit on the heavy side when compared to other keyboard cases.My overall impression is that this is a great idea, but Belkin fell short of what I'd like to see in a keyboard case like this
I adore the actual keyboard, but without anything to protect the back of the iPad, and no suggestions from Belkin about how best to go about this (i.e., what back covers would be compatible with the FastFit), I feel less secure using this to travel because a slip could mean my iPad hits the ground with no protection on one whole side
It also means the iPad is vulnerable to scratches from normal use.I think any keyboard screen cover like this should come standard with some form of back protection
The reviews for Belkin's own back protector (which may or may not be compatible with the FastFit) are terrible, but at least if Belkin included it with the FastFit, I'd have something to keep my iPad safe on both sides


One-sided protection doesn't really impress me; Especially when the side being protected is the sturdier Gorilla Glass side, and not the vulnerable aluminum side.Will I use it? Sure, from time to time at home I think I might..


But I'm not eager to go out in public with this thing as the only protection for my iPad


It's just not enough.Three stars for general build quality and the nice keyboard keys

I docked two stars out of the five total for the "don't like" reasons above.UPDATE: I picked up the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover, and for those wondering how the Belkin compares..

Well, I hate to be unkind, but the Belkin is bulkier, doesn't attach magnetically to the iPad when in landscape view, and doesn't have the nifty magnetic connection at the hinge like a Smart Cover


In short, Logitech simply out-thought Belkin on this one

It doesn't mean the Belkin is bad by any means, but that when compared to the Logitech it just falls short in key areas that Logitech nailed


HOWEVER, the Logitech is typically thirty bucks more expensive than the Belkin, so if you're on a budget the Belkin's a great alternative to the Logitech Ultrathin

If you can swing the extra cash, though, you may want to compare them before jumping in.

$REVIEW.: Love this little gadget! I have cut out cable and now only pay for my internet connection and Roku subscriptions to Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime

I have SO much programming to choose from, I can watch it when I want, and I still save money!Forget those days of flipping through channels looking desperately for something interesting to watch while wondering, "Why do I pay for all this garbage?"  And even the free Roku channels offer some great content--I love having so many interesting and educational TED talks to choose from


 I get to revitalize my long-neglected German skills with Euronews and Tageschau, and found another free channel that gives me streaming European radio content


 And there are so many "niche" channels, both public and private, available for foreign programming, sports, politics, and other interests.All I recommend to anyone contemplating a Roku is this--get an antenna for your local channels or cut your cable back to absolute basic


 The Roku will handle the rest of your TV entertainment needs!

I wanted a wireless desktop mouse but was afraid a non-gaming mouse would have poor polling rates and lag.  Well I certainly can't tell the difference between it being plugged in and unplugged (plugging it into usb both charges and acts as the data transfer connection) so that is a plus.  The plethora of buttons would have been awesome in the prime of my World of Warcraft days but now are far to many for standard browsing that I find myself most often doing.The biggest downside to this mouse is the batterylife.  Even using a profile that is battery saving, I have to plug the thing in every week or so if I leave the mouse turned on.  I have to remember to turn it off when not in use, but I often forget to do this.PROS:- Truly viable wireless gaming mouse- Multiple profiles for different games- Grip material on side is nice- Button clicks are crispCONS:- Poor battery life- Very heavy- Software looks archaicThis is not a casual use wireless mouse alternative.  This is a true wireless gaming mouse that has downsides overall (i.e. battery life) to approach wired gaming mouse standards.

$review_text.: I've used OS X since its advent and it was nice to have an OS that seemed to get things right.  Over the years Apple has made a lot of good changes to the OS, but the last two updates only seem to make things worse / frustrating.  I won't get into specific nitpicking over the OS here, but just wanted to mention that as good as this laptop is it's sad that the OS is holding it back at times.The laptop itself is awesome.  Just the right size and weight.  Not too thin and not too thick.  The screen is great... but FYI the default resolution in OS X for Retina displays is much lower than the native res.  The native resolution on these laptops is 2560x1600 but OS X wants to run it as &amp;#34;Best for Retina&amp;#34; resolution which is a High DPI pixel doubled 1280x800 resolution.  Luckily there are utilities you can get that will let you push the resolution up to native or at least higher than the 1680x1050 maximum OS X lets you set it to natively.  I run it at 2048x1280 when I want to maximum screen space... which is about as comfortable of a resolution you can make it on such a tiny screen.  You can run it at 2560x1600, but be aware that the rendered text is so tiny you have to get super close just to read it.There is something to be said for the quality and image sharpness in the High DPI modes over native resolution modes... but it comes down to what is more important to you.  When coding on it I appreciate as much screen space as I can get when doing UI layout... but appreciate being able to read the text more at the lower resolutions.  I suggest installing one of the few utilities that let you switch between 2 resolutions quickly and keep a lower and higher resolution always at the ready for whichever best suits your need at that moment.Also performance-wise I have no complaints.

$review_text.: I am new to wireless triggers and this is my first ever purchase


I have been wanting to pick up something but did not want top spend Pocket Wizard kind of money

I have thought about picking up some Cybersyncs instead but still wanted to spend less


I have never owned anything made by Yongnuo and have heard varying reviews on their products

Starting with packaging, they did a great job

Nice box, well packed, easily setup

I am using these with a Canon 40d and some Yongnuo YN-560 speed lights that I purchased on this order

I bought 3 strobes and two sets of the RF-603's, enough for each strobe and one for my camera
Connections to camera and strobes was easy but there is no threads on them to screw to a light stand
You can hang them via a sync cable or use an adapter for your stands with a cold shoe foot


My stands have adapters with a thumb screw to tighten your strobes so they stay tight.Testing involved setting up two strobes on 7 foot light stands and one on a foot that came with the flash
Each had a RF-603 attached and were placed around the room
I attached another RF-603 to my camera and fired off several frames at various sync speeds.I was able to maintain a consistent sync speed of 1/250 and pushed it up to 1/320 with very little signs of the rear curtain
Could I get away with 1/320? Yes, so long as I frame the shot accordingly

I did attempt 1/400 but lost about 1/4 of the shot to the rear curtain
In my opinion, these will maintain sync speeds for most shooters.I also tested wirelessly triggering the camera using the included sync cable and it works perfectly


For this setup, I took a RF-603 off on of my strobes and set it to slave mode


I then fired off several shots remotely without any issues.I have not done any long range tests because it has been raining pretty bad here in Florida
I will update this review when I get more details.From the testing that I have done so far, I can say that I am VERY impressed with these
I would recommend them to anyone wanting to start shooting wirelessly

Build quality is top notch and they just work, period.

$REVIEW.: I upgraded to this motherboard from a Dell XPS 8500 and let me tell you, I see the difference.  I really enjoyed the ease of use with setting it up and connecting everything to it.  I've read some complaints that the sata positioning is weird (it doesn't come out perpendicular to the board (at you), but there are positioned where the plug runs parallel to the board (to the right).  It worked well for me because I ran the sata's around the back side of the case and was able to sneak them right in.  I actually prefer them that way.The board is labeled very clearly and has 2 CPU fan inputs and 3 system fan inputs.  I was able to get in a pretty big CPU heatsink and fan, the RAM, my two MSI GTX OC Power Edition 670s with plenty of room to spare.  Everything fit beautifully and I ran into no problems with connecting everything.If you're looking to SLI or Crossfire, this board does not come with the required bridge cables.  Make sure you have one or buy one when ordering this board.  It only supports 2-way SLI, but it does support 3-way Crossfire.  The PCI-e 2 and 5 slot have a large space in between them so there is plenty of room for two GPUs, but I would imagine if your GPU is very big and you're trying to Crossfire 3 AMD GPUs, the PCI-e slot 7 is pretty close to not only the PSU (if you're case has the PSU at the bottom), but to the connectors for the case, fan inputs, etc.  I didn't try to connect one of my 670s to that last one to test it, but it would be a tight fit for sure.Once I tinker with the Bios a bit more I'll update my review.  But for the first week, it's been silky smooth.

A nice wood finis with some design on them certainly sets them apart from your basic black, white, etc. earbuds.  For looks alone, I think they are a notch up on typical earbuds.Performance is very good.  Highs are clean and clear, midranges not distorted even at high volumes, and lows are good.  I didn't notice any weaknesses on bass like others mentioned.  I did find that these produced sound quality comparable to some much higher priced products.  I noticed instrument nuances and sounds I've not really noticed before on some songs even at very low volume.  I would rate these excellent for reproduction of sound.Now to the flaws: Two things kept these from being a 5 for me.....in fact, had the sound reproduction not been so wonderful and the looks so cool I might have rated this a 3 or said avoid them.One: other people in the room complained they could hear my music even on lower volumes and even if I used various ear bud covers for a snug fit and better seal against my ear.  I know these are not touted as noise canceling, but there seems to be an unusual amount of spillover of sound.  People sitting across the room could identify the songs I was listening to, etc.Second, the wire, while of typical and ample length and terminated in 24k gold, either isn't insulated or ??  You can touch the wiring while you are listing to music and hear the sound of you tapping on/touching the wire.  This prompted me to take these on a short jog.  Although there was no background noise from the wire moving along my shirt, if I so much as brushed my hand on the wire, that got picked up in the ear buds.These are not huge, huge deals, but enough to keep you from fully enjoying the buds to their full potential.  You won't be able to listen to them in a quiet setting without sharing your music, which others may not want.  And the noise from the "live" wire has got to go.Still, the sound quality was excellent otherwise, with no distortion, great highs and mids and good lows, and the wood is quite the conversation piece.  I would buy these if you can live with the flaws.

$REVIEW.: If you don't have USB 3.0, then you have to get it on your machine

 It is the difference in daylight and dark for all your peripherals.I RECEIVED A QUERY THAT SHOULD BE NOTED:If your computer doesn't support USB 3.0, then you will have what it does support.However, if you have a desktop or a laptop with a pci slot, then you may upgrade


If you do, this device will scream! If not, it will work at whatever USB speed that IS supported by your computer...NOTE:  I just got a PNY USB 3.0 thumb drive
 It was not recognized by the computer when it was put in the hub

 It appears that the firmware in the hub and the thumb drive don't dance well together


 It DID function in a native USB 3.0 slot directly from the mother board, so it is a hub problem
 All my other peripherals work at blazing speeds in this hub.

$review_summary.: A wonderfully able hub

$review_text.: This is a very good product - for those that complain that Windows 7 is not touch friendly they simply have not tried a proper Windows 7 tablet.  The build quality of the eee slate is excellent - the aluminum around the edge of the screen and sides is a single piece and is very sturdy; the beautiful glass screen is strong and allows you to press down hard without worrying about it breaking.  I think Asus really should have wrapped the aluminum around to the back of this device as well - they used a textured plastic to give it a grip but I also think they did this to cut some costs.  If you are charging $1100 for this device there should be zero cutting costs at all - make this as attractive as possible = less plastic.The device include wireless b/g/n and bluetooth - all work excellently and asus includes software to turn off the wifi and bluetooth individually as well as an airplane mode to turn all off with one button press.The pen works just as it should - pixel accuracy and you can draw with precision as there is a built in wacom digitizer in this screen.  The slate comes with artrage studio demo software and allows you to test out the tablet fully.Asus ships this device using 125% DPI setting but I switched it back to 100% so text and applications arent stretched; many developers simply dont make their applications properly dpi aware so Windows 7 scales them using its own built in scaler method - while this is okay it makes text somewhat blurry and images jaggy.  Something developers really need to focus on and implement as even dpi is important for 30 inch screens.This isnt really a tablet that should be used like an ipad - you certainly can browse the web, check/write emails and do everything on the ipad with this but it will take more screen taps and the user interface is definaely built more for a mouse.  That being said when browsing the internet and you run into flash videos they work fine provided the tablet is in landscape mode - if you switch it to portrait mode most of the time flash video is cut off - even if you try to pinch/zoom in on the page the flash video is still cut off and you cant view the entire video.  This tablet is really better used in landscape mode.This isnt a light weight tablet, its heavy.  You really will need to put this in your lap while you use it.Windows 7 Experience Index Scores:Processor - 5.6Memory (RAM) - 5.6Graphics - 3.3Gaming graphics - 4.7Primary hard disk: 5.9Base Score (lowest subscore) - 3.3--  NegativesThe only negative I could find about this device is that Asus should have waited for the Sandy Bridge processor was out.  The graphics performance on this device is really lacking and so is the battery life.  Hopefully Asus creates another Windows 7 tablet in the future which uses the Intel Sandy Bridge processor - it will improve graphics up to what the nvidia 320 gpus could do and also would improve battery life tremendously.  You will see random frame drops when viewing 720p content on this device - it happens occassionly but not so often that it is bothersome - probably 1-2 times every 10 minutes; and typically on fast action scenarios in a movie.  This is really more to do with the graphics performance of intels onboard video; if Asus puts out a Sandy Bridge version then there will be no frame drops or freezing at all.  Gaming is okay on this device, I could play games like angry birds and world of goo (both touch friendly) without issue but if you try with more intense games it will be difficult and laggy - something nvidias 320 gpu can easily do and something the new intel sandy bridge processors will be able to accomplish.Battery life is around 3 hours and 30 minutes, you may be able to squeeze a little more if you use power saver mode.  Again if Asus puts out a sandy bridge version of this tablet that battery performance will also increase.All in all this is an excellent device, but was built a little too early; if Asus upgrades this device with an intel sandy bridge cpu it will be easily a 5/5 star product.

$review_text.: Exactly as advertised!Basically what this does is limit the frame to minimize flare that you can't otherwise remove, saving post-processing time. The rubber is soft and does provide additional protection as well. I also feel it added a more professional look to my DLSR (XTi), in all 3 positions. Threads are perfect, and fit, finish and function are as well. For the price, and perhaps at any price, the most I could have asked for.Bonus: arrived a week before promised date (free shipping), with order complete! What more could one want?

$REVIEW.: When you buy a cable, you want something that works. Thankfully, this one does.Unfortunately, build quality is on the cheap side. The DP side locks in place, but the plastic it is made out of feels chintzy and cheap. The connection is OK, but if you want this as a solution to say, be semi-mobile with a laptop, find something else. My use is fairly stable and doesn't move around, so the connection this provides is exactly what I want. The cheap price helps.I haven't run into any sync issues with the display and no problems with dropped data. Works as expected, just a little cheaply built.

The old one was just having issues freezing up and had to be re-booted at least once a week.  I bought this one on recommendation from a friend, and so far, it has met my every expectation... save one... RANGE!The router out of the box is easy to set up, and activating/deactivating the 5GHz channel is as easy as adding or removing a check-mark.  I left the 5GHz channel running so I could get the benefits at close range, but very few of my devices support 5GHz, so I may change that channel back to 2.5GHz and be done with it.  The good news is that all my laptops, etc. have excellent data speeds now, even at 2.5GHz!My biggest complaint thus-far is range.  My old G+ was in the same location, but I could get good signal nearly anywhere on my property (even the gazebo ~100' away from the house).  Not so much with this router... I'm struggling to get a signal in my driveway which is one wall and 60-ft from the router, and get NOTHING at the gazebo.  Even signal in the farthest bedroom is spotty (40' and two walls).  I've called Linksys about it and they suggested moving the router to a different location, first of all, that is not easily possible, and secondly, the old one worked GREAT in that location... I'll try moving it at a later date, but if it does not make it better, I'll have to ask for a warranty replacement, as I feel something is wrong with this unit.  I'll update this review afterwards.UPDATE:After speaking with Cisco support via phone and chat several times, regarding channel settings, etc., I've played with settings until I've found a channel combination that seems to work much better for my home.  I've disabled the 5GHz (switched it to 2.4GHz), running dual-band 2.4Ghz, and also re-enabled the 5Ghz band in my quest for better range.  I've continued to tweak channels and found two channel combinations that seem to provide better range for my wireless devices.  If you have range issues with this router, switch the channel selection from "Auto", and give each channel and frequency a test to see what works best for your home/business.  It will take a little effort, but if "Auto" is not working for you, this is the best option for finding the best range and speed (reduction of interference).I still like the router, and Cisco/Linksys customer support has been great to work with, but honestly, out of the box, I expected better function and range... and right now, I'm still not getting the range I received from my old WRT110 G+ router.  Yes, the router is a good router (no crashes, lockups, bottlenecks, etc.), speed is better than my old router (wired or wireless), but range is still not in my "happy-zone".  Raised review to 4-stars from three, because of customer support help, and the fact that it does work!

$REVIEW.: I am inserting a copy of my review of theSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB Thunderbolt Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000400)as they were tested together. Minor changes due to change of venue ;-)Well, well, well! I previously got aSeagate Backup Plus 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STCA2000100, and aSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101), both of which I reviewed in Vine. At first I had to use them with FW800 and they were quick. I purchased aSonnet Allegro USB 3.0 PCIe Card (2-Ports, Macintosh/Windows) USB3M-Efor my Mac Pro (Early 2009) MB871LL/A, 2.66GHz Quad Core Xeon, and they are really fast! I kept procrastinating on buying theSeagate Backup Plus Desktop Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE129)to use them with for several reasons, 2 being the cost and the fact I only have Thunderbolt on my MacBook Pro (17-INCH, LATE 2011) and do not use it for storage purposes.Then along comes a Vine offer and I was able to acquire both this STAE129 AND theSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB Thunderbolt Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000400)!!!  WAHOOOOO!!!Well, today I busted open the boxes. I disconnected the USB 3.0 adapter from the first 3GB drive and connected it up to the STAE129. I took all up the my MacBook Pro, connected up the cables, and daisy-chained the STAE129 to the STCB3000400 using a Thunderbolt cable I had lying about (fortunately, AS A THUNDERBOLT CABLE IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THE STAE129!!! GRRRRR!. Had to initialize the drive connected to the STAE129... don't know why*, it worked on my Mac Pro with USB 3.0, but heck, initialization is FAST too.So, both drives show up on the desktop, I start up QuickBench and run the tests (results follow). I then ran a second test on the daisy-chained drive with it directly connect to the MacBook Pro - no appreciable difference so daisy-chaining is OK = 6TB of FAST drive space 8-0!

$REVIEW.: I was not going to purchase this item until I read a dozen glowing reviews for this friction mount

Whoever got the patent for this thing did it right


It sticks to slick granite at a 45 degree angle, and it clings to my truck dashboard like a cat to a tree


I hate stuff stuck to my windshield and this is the answer! If you live in Califiornia or any state that bans stuff stuck to your windshield, or are like me hating junk dangling when you drive you MUST buy this for your Garmin.

$review_text.: This IPOD has a lot of problems and in my opinion is NOT worth the inflated cost. Here are my problems with it.1. It doesn't support FLAC, OGG or any other high quality transfers.2. The video function is a pain and difficult to use, unless you want to pay high costs on itunes for movies3. The battery is not nearly as long-lasting as they suggest, and they are prone to die after a year leaving you with an expensive repair.4. They scratch very easily.5. They often freeze and I have found that the IPOD can't seem to handle over 15 GBs without freezing constantly.6. They often need to be "reformated" which means that you lose all of your music collection from the ipod and must start again.But, my biggest gripe is how fragile these things are. I bought mine from best buy on warantee and within two months the IPOD headphone socket was messed up and I had to bring it back, they couldn't fix it so they gave me another one. Now a year later, I am having more troubles because the IPOD often refuses to sync. I have lost my entire collection of IPOD library countless times and need to re-enter all of the albums again which is a huge pain. I bought this thing for convenience and I am wishing I would have just kept my portable disc player!Buy a cheaper portable digital media player you wont regret it!

I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the sound quality is for a unit this small. I would compare the sound quality to that of a good quality nightstand radio (or radio/CD player/alarm clock, etc.). My desktop and laptop (the former running Windows 7 64-bit, the latter Vista) recognized the USB dongle right away, so for me set up was literally plug &amp; play. I did have to discover on my own (this wasn't in the literature) that turning the speaker off (there's a button on the upper rear of the unit) turns Windows Media Player off, and in order to switch from using the Z515 to wired speakers I have to remove the USB dongle (and can do so by simply removing it, i.e., no need to go through a "safely remove this hardware" step). (If I want to mute the unit without turning Windows Media Player off, I have to remember to simply turn it down instead of off.)One bit of information you won't find in the literature or at the Logitech website concerns the life of and potential to replace the built-in rechargeable battery. I emailed Logitech and received a response within less than 24 hours, and am told that Logitech will replace the unit "free of charge" should the battery fail within the 2 year warranty period, and that the battery is otherwise NOT "user" replaceable. Whether this means that it can be replaced by a handy user who is into opening gadgets up remains to be seen, but I do want to mention that the presence of recessed screws on the rear of the unit lead me to think that it may at least be possible to open the unit up (after the warranty period has passed, of course) and maybe replace the battery. In any case, the speaker can also be AC powered via the included adapter.I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker to a laptop using student living in a dorm or anyone whose living quarters are small or who travels with a laptop - or simply an MP3 player (which requires a wired connection) - and wants to have with them a handy portable travel speaker. The Z515 comes with a handsome zippered carrying case with a fairly rugged exterior (the carrying case holds the speaker but not the AC adapter; the USB dongle fits into a compartment under the fold-out speaker stand) to protect it during transport. Would make a great gift for a college student who doesn't have room for wired computer speakers.The wireless range has been great for me. I can go anywhere in any room of my 1700 square foot home and stay connected, and I can go on the porch, in the garage, or close to the house in the driveway without getting disconnected.Would make a great gift for anyone who can use a compact wireless speaker. Although the sound is stereo - there are two speakers side-by-side in the unit - because of the size of the unit and short distance of the speakers from each other, the sound of the Z515 is akin to that of a good quality mono table radio. I personally don't get much sense of stereo separation when listening to it, but I don't count this as a drawback or con given the size, convenience, portability, and overall sonic quality of the unit.

 I followed the directions and attached it to a late-model Samsung LED TV


 The AV connection worked, but the HDMI connection did not


 I confirmed the HDMI cable was good and that the TV HDMI port worked


 I then tried connecting the unit to another HDTV

The HDMI display did not work on either HDTV
 I called Roku support
 The tech walked me through turning the unit and TV on and off, hot swapping cables, and registering the unit so he could try a fix from his end

 In this process, I had to enter my wi-fi password (a long one) twice using the unit's clunky alpha numeric interface

 At one point, the tech told me that because the AV connection worked and the HDMI did not, it was my TV's firmware not recognizing the Roku unit

 I explained that I'd also tried another HDTV (an LG brand) and had the same issue


 Finally, after consulting with a supervising tech and having me go through the entire testing scenario again and re-booting the unit, no improvement
 He let me know that I could return the unit through Amazon


The tech was as helpful as he could be, given the steps he was required to put me through
 I don't fault the tech
The final capper was that I bought the unit to work with Amazon Prime, and when I tried (using the AV connection) to access Amazon Prime, the Roku could not make the connection and told me to try again later or contact Amazon


Given this experience, I returned the unit for a refund rather than try a replacement
I'll just buy a blu-ray player that's compatible with Amazon Prime
I didn't do this in the first place because I already have a nice Blu-ray player that does not work with Amazon Prime.

$review_text.: All of the items listed were purchased from Amazon. I purchased this case along with the Max5G case from Thermaltake. I use a Sabertooth Z77  motherboard which has the latest USB 3.0. For testing, I used a Seagate 1TB Sata3 (6GB) Constellation ES3, and a Seagate ES 750GB SATA2 drive. Using the SATA2 drive, both cases show with the CrystalDiskMark using USB3 to have 81MB/s read and 78MB/s write with 1GB blocks. At 512K, half that speed. On USB2, the readings were 35MB/s and 30MB/s. The big difference came when using the SATA3 drive on USB3. The MAX5G case provided 187MB/s read and 185MB/S write, while this case was 118MB/s read and 121MB/s write. All tests were repeated. Comparing the two cases, the Startech does have the aluminum sides, with mostly plastic for the 5G. Other than that, the Max5g is the better of the two at a higher price. FYI, the 5GB/s quoted in literature for cases in general only applies to the maximum speed of the USB 3.0 interface, NOT the speed of the controller of the enclosure. Depending on the chipset, speed and compatibility varies considerably. Both of the cases mentioned use the most compatible chipset, but not the same model.

$review_text.: PROS:Works really well on iPhones, iPods, and probably iPads and other oleophobic screensGood for a light cleaning for other devicesEasy to useMade in USACONS:Not so good for non-oleophobic screensThe iEraser is basically a slightly fuzzy microfiber clot, sewn around a soft block and attached to a flat plastic handle.  It looks like a very flat, chalkboard eraser, but a far more stylin'.  It will work with an iPhone or iPod touch, but--given its 4" x 2 3/4" size--is more suited for devices with 10" screens and larger, although it worked respectably well with a 7" tablet.  The surrounding block is easy to grip and easy to manipulate across an appropriate sized screen.The iEraser was excellent in removing smudges, dust, fingerprints, and pretty much all other debris from my iPhone screen and my iPod.  My guess is that it will work well on any oleophobic, glass surface.  The problem is that it did not work so well on my iMac screen, a laptop, or my flat screen TV.  Sure, it will remove dust and light smudges on these surfaces, but will not do it with same ease as it does on screens that are designed to repel foreign matter.  With the regular glass screens, you have to apply a little more pressure and accept the fact that not all smudges will relent at the sight of the iEraser.So for conventional glass, you should probably start with a traditional cleaning.  You can then use the iEraser for maintenance, as it will work on just about any screen for dust removal, so once you give your screen a traditional cleaning, it will be fine for upkeep.There is really no secret here: the iEraser cleans using a microfiber cloth.  You can get exactly the same effect by using the microfiber cloth you use to clean your glasses and applying it to your iDevice or TV.  I do have to hand it to iEraser people, though. Slapping the microfiber cloth onto a foam square and attaching a plastic block does make the process easier (and far more fun to do if like this kind of thing).  And it's also nice to find something that is actually manufactured in the USA.  Still, you may very well have all the equipment to do a screen cleaning, iEraser style, without buying the device in the first place.Warning: To avoid scratching your screen,you have to make sure that the screen is clear of any abrasive particles before using the iEraser.  If you move the abrasive particles around with the iEraser (or any microfiber cloth) you may well scratch your screen.CONCLUSION: The iEraser works just fine for touch-screen iDevices and similar devices with oleophobic screens.  Not so hot with conventional glass, but good for removing dust and light smudges.

$REVIEW.: I replaced an old NUVI 265W with this unit. I absolutely refused to pay the ridiculous price Garmin wanted to update the map data on my old device.This GPS is definitely much better than the old. It SHOULD be for the $299 price tag I paid (Now $199... nice). However, it is still not painless to use.The traffic information is virtually useless. The coverage is pathetic and the ads that make it "free" are terribly annoying.The ECO Route is nothing remarkable. Basically, as long as you don't speed and avoid roads that are stop-and-go, you are going to do fine.The large screen is nice and clear. But, the touch screen functionality is fair at best compared to other modern devices. If you use an iPhone, iPad, etc. it is painful to use by comparison (slow and lacking sensitivity).The menu structure is too complex and takes a LOT of navigation to get to the more refined search options and settings. The fact that you cannot return to the map at any point with one selection is unforgivable.Finally, as with every other NUVI I have used, searching for Points of Interest by NAME is absolutely awful. Seriously, it takes FOREVER. If I type in the name of a State Park or Recreation Area, it should come up with little or no delay. Unfortunately, that is not the case. So, it is best to always look up actual addresses online before entering locations into the GPS.I still think Garmin makes the best GPS units on the market. I just don't feel that they have kept pace with the improvements in user interface technology for mobile electronics.I'm also sour about paying </review_text><review_summary>Bought two for linux fileserver</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2OWR5G2OAQF7C"><latest_review_date>14/05/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B002WE4HE2</product_id><review_date>14/05/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[5, 5]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Garmin should make this standard for the Nuvi...</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2OXGLRMYMXCHY"><latest_review_date>07/08/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00002EQCW</product_id><review_date>07/08/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>Far exceeds expectations -- clear pictures, no fuss.

$review_text.: This lens is much sharper than the fisheye adapter for NEX. It's easy to control and focus even though it's all manual. Since the lens is so wide and has such a large depth of field, focus isn't much of an issue. My only problem is there seems to be some purple vignetting when shooting on my NEX-7. I can fix it in Photoshop or FCP Pro, so for the money, I don't think there's a better fisheye option. Love the sharpness on this one.

I plan to leave it inserted permanently, but I did not want it to be stuck in there anyway.Other than that, I connected my new Western Digital Passport 1.0 TB USB 3.0 hard drive to it and it works well.

That being said, I still don't feel like I have had enough time to figure everything out on the player
For instance, I haven't yet figured out why I can't pause my blu-rays for more than a few minutes without getting sent back to the main menu and having to go through all the previews again


One other thing I don't like and this may be specific to the discs themselves and not the blu-ray, is that it takes FOREVER to get through the previews to get to the main menu


There seems to be random movies that I can get straight to the menu but most will force me to watch every preview..
unless I skip through each individual preview


BLEH


Also switching from the blu-ray menu to the player menu where the apps are available tends to take a really long time


Lately I have had a few times where I am trying to get through Blockbuster onDemand menus and the player freezes and I have to restart, but I assume that is typical of technology
Overall this is a good unit.

$review_text.: Bought this for my desktop I keep at my girls house. Worked great with one 20 inch 720p monitor in it Then I plugged in Two 1080p Monitors and it still performs decently noticed a .2 drop on the windows scale went down to 6.6. On a custom case with a Intel dual core board. Was surprised that it doesn't require any extra power... no 4 or 6 pin pci e power needed. And run fairly cool compared to the giant cards I have in my main desktop.

$review_text.: I purchased this mouse, thinking that it was Bluetooth compatible...unfortunatedly it is not.  It works very well with the supplied USB receiver which has a storage spot on the underside of the mouse.  The mouse has a nice design and is compact in height (28mm) but a normal size footprint, making it a nice travel mouse.

From my experience so far I would recommend it - here is some (hopefully) relevant info about this clock/camera:- unit is small, but feels pretty sturdy and well-crafted- I leave it plugged into an outlet - the rechargeable battery alone lasts 4 hours when recording (according to the seller), and about a day without recording (according to me)- get a USB extension cable - the USB cord supplied does not reach an outlet close to the ground if the clock is on a table- video resolution can be set to 640 x 480; out of the box it was 320 x 240- video settings (resolution, video quality, night mode, etc) can be changed when you are in recording mode, and go to &amp;lt;monitor settings&gt; using the volume forward or reverse buttons (thanks to Inspector Gadget for mentioning this in his review!)- out of the box, night vision is weak - can be improved by going into &amp;lt;monitor settings&gt; and set &amp;lt;DV night mode&gt; to "on"; it was "off" out of the box, even though it still had some IR recording capabilities (? - not sure why) - anyway, with &amp;lt;DV night mode&gt; on, you get an OK-ish quality 6-7 feet range in a completely dark room- Mini SD card that comes with the package deal is a class 4 card- out of the box it records 30 min clips, each clip is approx. 30-50 MB in size (for 320x240) or 200-300MB (for 640x480 in high quality) - so for an overnight recording, you would find 20+ clips, each 30 min long, in the morning (video clip length can be changed in &amp;lt;monitor settings&gt; to either 10min, 30min, or 1hr)- this also implies that you get about 15 days of continuous recording on a 16GB card on the lowest 320x240 setting; on the better 640x480 setting, your 16GB card is filled up after about 3 days.- MAC users: this unit gives me a weird problem: when I connect it directly via USB, it keeps mounting multiple desktop icons (and by that I mean many, i.e. &gt;10, and just keeps going). Somewhat annoying, so I just pop out the SD card, put it into an adapter and put that in my iMac. Takes 5 seconds and works nicely. Anybody else encountered this issue, with either Mac or PC?- MAC users: there might be a difference playing videos when using QuickTime Player versus other players (VLC, MPlayerX etc) in regards to sound

 These cables are commoditized at this point, so barring defects most people look to value when selecting one
 My primary thought is that choosing longer cable lengths may offer more bang for your buck
 So even if you think you only need the shortest one, it's probably best for you to get the longer 10 or 15 foot cable and wind up the excess.PROS:++ Ethernet cable worked as advertised with no excessive errors or dropped packets++ Works from standard 10-base-T speeds all the way up to Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps)++ Standard clear RJ45 connectors++ Snagless design with sliding boots to protect connectors++ Sliding boots make it easier to snap in connectors in with low clearance++ Thick tabs to minimize the chance of breakage++ Thick PVC cable construction for sufficient durability++ Cable also seems to be kink-free compared to most budget cables++ Frustration free packaging standard++ Standard 5-year warrantyCONS:-- Longer lengths provide a better value-- Generic black cable is hard to pick out near many other cables-- No class info printed on cable jacket (a standard feature on better cables)-- Cable has some memory when unwound-- Some may prefer hard-molded boots or double tabbed connectorsCONCLUSIONThe cable and connectors are of acceptable construction
 For basic connectivity, this product works as advertised

 Just review all the available lengths to make sure you are getting the best value possible.Enjoy.

$review_text.: This is a very good glass filter. The multicoated anti glare finish is excellent in making this almost invisible when light is reflecting directly at it which is something you would want when putting this in front of a lens. The built quality is excellent the price is affordable and it can easily compare to the Hoya Pro-1 UV(0) filters which are pretty much the same as far as quality. One downside to this filter is cleaning it, can be a more laborious task since the finish on this glass can sometimes have scuff marks on it, of course there are the B+W filters which have another coating that mitigates that but a 3x the price. I always put on one of these Sigma UV filters or the Hoya Pro-1 UV(0) filters on all my lenses. It just gives you that stress free shooting experience since you can get close to your subject with out fearing it will cause damage to the lens itself. I do rarely take them off from time to time depending on the environment I am shooting in. I would say stay away from the non-multicoaded stuff it just causes to much light reflection, specially at night.Great Multicoated Glass, Virtually invisible to the camera and lens. Crucial accessory for protecting those expensive lenses.

The board works as expected, but I think it would be better with a higher contrast for the screen.I guess the board doesn't have internal memory or any kind of USB interface for the sake of battery live and keeping its weight light, but those features would be great considering that the user could want to save the sketch/writing/calculations made; a photograph can do, but it's not very practical.

When they worked, they were very charming and I really appreciated the rich sound
As another reviewer pointed out, these guyz are hot on the ears
I would probably only use this headset for the occasional game of counterstrike and wear some better quality headphones with more breating room for regular listening and gaming.The fantastic sound that these make in mind, my headphones broke remarkably easy


Personally, I am in my latter teens and I am pretty careful of my gaming equipment

I can imagine someone less careful than me having a far less time span of this headset.The cord is undeniably too small and thin, that is all there really is to say

I would invest in a higher quality Senn product because they make great sound.

I have removed them and just "attach" the phones around the goggles. No problems here.I like its small size and the soft material used for the earbuds. But sometimes the in-ear detaches from the phone and you cannot easily pull the seal from inside your ear. I do not have long nails so I need to keep simming to finish the laps and then go home to finally remove the seal with a pair of tweezers. This can be very annoying and happens to other waterproof phones as well. The good thing is that if the seal comes off while you are swimming, it floats, so you do not lose them.Nevertheless, they should come with a spare seal for each of the 3 sizes that are shipped.No noticeable issues with the sound quality, which is good, in my opinion. If you are swimming and not listening to a classical piece quietly in your living room, the phones do a pretty good job by keeping water out and by being louder than all the splashing that's going on around you.Good cost/benefit overall.

$REVIEW.: Id have to go with the crowd on this one, pretty disappointed with this item.  While I wouldn't give it 1 star, (it did show up, description matches item, it is anti glare, and it didnt like catch on fire or blow up or anything), but it is deficient in several areas.  I really liked the Marware case, which is why I had high expectations for this item as well.  The applicator helped get most of the bubbles out from under the protector, but mine still lifts around the very edges. This leaves me the feeling I'll go through the 2 screens rather quickly as they'll lift and peel, allowing dirt and dust to comb between the screen and the protector. The cleaning cloth provided is probably insufficient to get the screen as clean as it should be before application.  Id recommend getting a good screen cleaner and wiping down with that first (if you have a lot of screens,I highly recommend the Bryson Screen Cleaner, 16 oz. Spray Bottle also sold on Amazon).  The anti-glare film on the screen protector is very pro-smudge.  Before I was done getting all the air pockets out, using a combination of the applicator and my finger tips, the entire thing was a swirly smudgy mess.  The occurrence of smudges continues on from here as evidenced with daily usage.  I found it was this pro-smudge effect of the anti-glare screen that made the text hard to read.  Live and learn I guess. I think others have recommended the clear version of this item.  Id definitely look at something else. Wish half star ratings were available, Id give it 2.5 stars.

It is four and the two side pieces are a little thin, you also have to put it together.  But if you can hit four studs, two on the top part of the frame and two on the bottom.  It should work fine.

Because to apply them you peel off a piece of plastic, then carefully roll the protector onto the screen, then peel off the paper tab on the protector.  The paper tab is stuck on with a glue that does not peel off, so you are left with a sizable chunk of paper tab glue residue on your screen.  They didn't need to use a nonremovable glue, but they probably made a million of these things with the wrong glue, and now they're giving them away for a little more than the cost of postage.

I wish I had known ahead of time that this camera simply does NOT do what it says it does. I give this item two stars for quick shipping and price. When I get my money back I'll let you know.I spent three hours playing with this camera and getting to know its features only to find that it has very limited and pathetic features. The quality of the photos doesn't go up when altered. Literally, each setting produced the same quality photo; all of them very low. There was so much noise (and remember, I do this for a living with multiple professional DSLRs. I'm not just blowing smoke here.) that the photo was impossible to use. It's shutter speed alterations did not correctly change shutter speed (At 125 shutter speed I was getting incredibly dark photos with f/3.6 and a 1600 ISO. Ridiculous.) The lens had severe light aberrations in normal sunlight, and while I'm on the topic, the lens zoom didn't adhere to the chosen frame setting. (At a selected 16:9, zooming cropped the screen quality. Why in God's name would it do that!?) The manual ability would have been great if it...well it just wasn't great. 14MP is hardly high quality when it's 14MP of low quality, poorly lit, blurred photos.

Frank for his/her insightful and extremely helpful review.  Without his/her information regarding the necessary driver for Windows 7, I would have passed on this board...Board arrived quickly (as usual with Amazon) and was physically easy to install.  The enclosed information from Diamond is almost useless but if you're installing your own system cards and tweaking your BIOS settings, I have to believe you really don't need much hand holding.  As stated by others, there are no drivers listed on the Diamond site for Windows 7 but you can simply follow R.L. Franks directions OR let Windows 7 direct you.  I downloaded the RC driver from the C Media site prior to receiving the board and installed from that download however, when first booting up the computer after physically installing the board, Windows 7 tried to install drivers from its on board library and finding none for this card, promptly found the C Media site driver and posted directions on how to obtain the proper driver - including a site to obtain the necessary decompression program.  Now that was impressive!Board itself works very nicely and has excellent sound.  Nice board for the price. I only gave it 4 stars because Diamond is so far behind the driver curve forcing customers to jump through additional hoops.  Poor customer support...

$REVIEW.: I love the eneloop batteries and they do last like they are advertised to do. The real bonus with this Super Power Pack is that you not only get the batteries and charger, you also get a really nice plastic fold up case to hold the batteries in. Eneloop batteries seem to last as long in my camera and remotes as I have experienced with Duracells. I would definetely recommend them.

$review_text.: The job I worked at until recently this year had lots of problems with people returning media. I researched this and found that unless your drive is an enternal computer dvd burner, or you have a brand new top of the line TV set top DVD recorder you can't use 8x speed disks end of discussion. so if you are looking for blank disks for a DVD burner you have hooked up to your TV most likely you should not buy these. However These are the only disks I have been able to get to work with my enternal Sony 16x dvd/cd burner. That is if I want them to play in my panasonic surround sound.

But I found that my iPad in its Marware folio cover wouldn't fit, so every time I want  to use the Belkin mount, I have to extract the iPad from the cover, which is a struggle since the cover is a tight fit


And with a 10" (full-sized) iPad, portrait mode won't work, as in that orientation the tablet is too tall for the Belkin holder


That's unfortunate, since I'd have preferred to read my recipes that way and avoid scrolling


And it's especially annoying since the product's packaging conspicuously boasts that it is "cover compatible"!Finally--and this is probably of interest only to RVers--all my cabinets have a 1" lip to prevent the contents from spilling out while underway, and that lip makes it impossible to tighten up the Belkin mount's clamping mechanism


It's still usable, but can be a bit wobbly
I don't really blame Belkin for this, but it's an annoyance in my situation.Bottom line: it's a good idea, but I'd like to see a larger vertical adjustment range to accommodate tablets in portrait mode, and a wider tablet clamp to allow for tablets in covers.

$REVIEW.: There has been plenty already written about this camera, so I am only going to mention the one feature nobody seems to have noticed. The camera body has a square bottom and a very well balanced center of gravity. That means you can take self-timer pictures by balancing the camera on a rock, car hood, or fence post. That is in case you forgot or didn't want to carry a tripod.Many other cameras (Casio and Sony come to mind) have a rounded or irregular bottom or a tendency to topple in one direction, which means you have to carry a small tripod in your other pocket at all times if you're planning to take self-pictures using the timer. I just took my first hiking trip with the SD1000, forgot the tripod, and it turned out the tripod is not nearly as critical as it had been with my other cameras!Complaints: The date-stamp feature only works in 1600x1200 mode.

$review_text.: I purchased the Seasonic SS-1250XM PSU for my second rig because it's running two GTX 780s in SLI (both overclocked) and I might even add a third one later so I need the best PSU that's out there. Since Seasonic makes the best PSUs in this industry, I decided to get the best PSU they make, the Seasonic SS-1250XM. I have had some old PSUs blow up on me so I went overbuild by purchasing this PSU, but I would rather be safe than sorry. I have seen PSUs blow up from left and right and kill all the components in the computer which is why I wanted something that was reliable and durable.The Seasonic SS-1250XM really feels like a premium PSU when holding it and the materials used to make it really make the PSU stand out from the rest of the PSUs that's out there. It feels very well polished and it has a nice clean design that's not cluttered like the rest of the PSUs I have bought. There are plenty of cables in the box that are packaged quite well. The cables are bundled in a case in the same gold and black motif in which the power supply itself is dressed. I can't hear the fan spinning at all when gaming and even under full load using Prime95 which says a lot about the quality of the PSU. There are so many cables and slots that you can use and I doubt I will ever need more than just a few.Obviously you are paying a premium for this power supply and you are definitely getting something that's worth every penny you spent. I am more than satisfied with it. Some people compare this to the Corsair AX1200 and even say that the Corsair one is better but they forget that the Corsair AX1200 is partially made by Seasonic so there you go. Seasonic SS-1250XM is a much better quality PSU than the Corsair AX1200 and is made by the best PSU manufacture in the world. I'm planning on buying another one for my friend because he wants to build a high end gaming rig so I recommended him to get this one and I'm sure he'll be impressed. I always trust Seasonic when buying a PSU and I always recommend it all of my enthusiast friends that build computers almost on a weekly basis. I have always had a good experience with the PSUs that Seasonic makes. I can't recommend this product enough times. All cables are long and sleeved very well.Seasonic is known for making very reliable and durable PSUs and the Seasonic SS-1250XM is no exception. The installation process is pretty straight forward and you don't need me to explain how to install it because most of us who purchase these kind of things are geeks and we know how stuff works. Another thing that I love about this PSU is that it runs super cool and is whisper quiet. My old PSUs used to make loud noises but this one is inaudible just like my EVGA SuperNOVA 1000W. I have had many PSUs shut down on me while playing games because they would overheat but this one handles everything like a champ.The Seasonic SS-1250XM is an extremely well built PSU and Seasonic has used very high quality materials that really show when you hold the PSU in hand. It is fully modular and has 8 PCIe connectors but you can either run two 8 pin CPU connectors or 4 PCIe connectors but not both. It has great sleeved cables that are nice and long and it's gold certified. The warranty is 5 years which is always nice because you never know what might happen in the future. I have had many products die on me a few days after the warranty expires and it's the worst thing that can happen. Seasonic's customer service is outstanding and they have always been very nice to me.Pros:+Can even power a jet engine :D+High amperage for even the most power hungry GPUs+Single 12V rail+Amazing build quality+80 PLUS GOLD Certified+Clean design+Dead silent+8 PCIe connectors+Fully modular+Great Packaging+From Seasonic+5 years warrantyCons:-NoneOverall, the Seasonic SS-1250XM is the best PSU your money can buy and it's worth every penny if you ask me. You can even power the most power hungry GPUs that's out there and it still has power left to power a jet engine.  If you are looking for something that's reliable and future-proof then the Seasonic SS-1250XM is the PSU you should purchase. The packaging is absolutely insane, it's almost unreal. When holding the PSU, you can really feel the high quality materials that Seasonic used to make this amazing PSU.I have been building and fixing computers for as long as I can remember and I have never come across a PSU that feels this high quality like the Seasonic SS-1250XM. I easily give it a 10/10 for the sturdiness, single 12V rail, fully modular, clean design and super quiet. I strongly recommend this PSU to all the enthusiasts who want the best the money can buy and you can never go wrong with Seasonic because they have an amazing customer service!My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K @ 4.6GhzPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit

$review_text.: The Beyerdynamic DT 770's are the perfect headphone for work. They are sealed well to leak little sound out, you will not disturb your neighbor at reasonable volumes. The large comfortable pads also help seal environmental noise out, even with no music outside sounds are decreased by about 20-30%. Build quality is fantastic: the cable is firmly attached, headband seems to flex well, cans seem firm and tight with no moving pieces.These are not the most picky headphones as far as connection is concerned, they do well un-amped, even from most portable devices; although battery drain is noticeable over ear buds. Amping these makes them really shine and even a cheaper amp make them sound great. Source is important considering these are extremely accurate, junk in == junk out.Sound quality is outstanding for every type of music I throw at it (Classical, Jazz, Rock, Rap), just make sure your ears are in about the center of the can as too far forward is bass city and too far back is treble town. Definition and Clarity are as good as Sennheiser 600s, if not slightly better. You can hear fingers move up and down strings, and vocals are clear but not over accented, percussion truly shine. The general sound is warm but not so soft that things start blending together. These are my favorite headphones that I own and would recommend them to anyone.

No power led, computer did not find it, etc. It's totally dead. I also don't understand why the power plug and cord are on the same side as the usb ports. So if I want to plug in usb devices, I have to have the cords wrap around the hub. Or to have the cords go back off my desk away from me, I have to plug in usb devices into the back (away from me) of the hub. Which means I have to turn it around to plug something in and then turn it back around to keep the cords from wrapping around the device. A very poor design.It's going back and being replaced with a different brand.

It was a Dell 17" with an i7-920 processor, Radeon HD4650 video card and 4GB of DDR3 RAM.This laptop blows it out of the water. Now I do have to stress that I replaced the included HDD withSeagate Momentus XT 750 GB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST750LX003since having a 5200 RPM HDD paired up with all the other excellent hardware in this laptop seemed like a crime. I never even powered on the laptop with the included HDD.You can even take the included HDD and buy an external enclosure for it (such asVantec NexStar TX 2.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 External Hard Drive Enclosure) and for $130 you have yourself a SSD-HDD Hybrid drive inside your laptop and a sleek 750GB external HDD.Back to the laptop, this thing is incredibly fast. Boots up in about 30 seconds (as in you press the power button and you're on your desktop in 30 seconds), runs games like Starcraft II on High with little to no stuttering and handles CPU intensive tasks with no problem.The backlit keyboard is also a major plus.If I had to list a negative it would be the lengthy amount of time it takes to start up the WiFi radio. When it turns on it takes around 1 minute to actually turn on the radio and connect to my WiFi. (It's not my router since all the other devices I have do not take as long.) However this is nowhere near a deal-breaker.For $670 this laptop is a steal. Add in $130 for the Hybrid drive and even at $800 this laptop is a steal. Puts some other so-called "Gaming laptops" priced at $1200+ to shame.Edit:I didn't even mention that the laptop speakers are pretty great. The best speakers I've heard (from a laptop). The included subwoofer does help a bit, but don't expect Theater quality sound. They're better than any other laptop I've heard, but they're still two tiny speakers with a tiny subwoofer crammed into a laptop. They're great for general purposes (ie. Gaming) but not so great if you are an audiophile.

$review_text.: This is a very innovative and practical product. Well lot of reviews for this product, mostly having problems with range. but I haven't found any issues with range. More than enough range to drive my cars audio from the the plug. The SD card slot can be little hard to find. In my opinion the product is somewhat overpriced at its current price.

Amazonbasics cables are built well and since it's digital, you're not going to better picture or better sound from anything costlier.  It also comes in a tidy little box with plastic protectors on the ends of the cable.Strongly recommended for anyone who needs a TOSLINK cable.

I usually shoot prime, but for only $200 more than the body, it seemed like a no brainer.  My only other zoom is the 24-105mm L, which also came in a kit.  While the 24-105 works on a full frame and has better build quality, it still is a good base for comparison.What stands out is the absolutely silent auto focus and IS. So it can be done...  Auto-focus is just as fast as the USM drive on the L lens and spot-on in accuracy (no adjustment needed on the 70D).  IS works also equally efficient.  I shot with both lenses hand held at 1/4 sec. from 6 feet away and no shake discernible at 100% view.  Good enough.Optically, both lenses show quickly that they are no primes, especially at the long end.  However, the difference in the field is not quite as dramatic and both are absolutely usable for most types of shots (except for when I need edge-to-edge sharpness for landscape).  Center sharpness of the EF-S lens is great, definitely in prime territory, and maybe a tad better than the L lens. Edge and corner sharpness is a little worse than the 24-105mm, which is to be expected given that the latter is for full frame.  But not by much, though neither one will win a prize here.  Blur or bokeh is also very similar, maybe a slight edge for the L lens, and gets an acceptable.  If you shoot crop, there is little reason to pick the 24-105mm over this one.  You get almost the same performance for a lower price.  What the 18-135mm lacks in rugged build quality, it makes up with the wider (and much more usable on crop) range and the better performance for video (especially when coupled with a body that can make use of it).So why only 4 stars?  Well, mine shows some softness in one corner at infinity focus, likely a centering problem.  Not unheard of (even with L lenses) and I might see if Canon can tweak it.  The other negative is the manual focus on STM lenses.  There is no direct mechanical connection (focus ring drives the motor) and it is more difficult to fine tune exact focus (if turned past the sweet spot, going back requires more travel).  But this is not a lens I would use for situations that require extremely precise manual focus...

After much frustration, I finally got all 4 channels programmed to use the international radio frequency my automobile radio supports.  However, when I start the car, the unit almost always seems to pick some random new radio frequency, on whichever of the 4 channels it happens to use.  That is, even though I have programmed all 4 channels to 87.9, the act of car ignition results in a different number appearing on the unit, (with the iPod turned on).  What is really peculiar is if I then flip through the 4 channels, all will say, and act properly, at 87.9.  So, for example, start the car, turn on the iPod, you get static, look at the iTrip, and it might say 101.5.  You hit the big round button and it shows you all four channels are at 87.9, and the one that was showing 101.5 now shows 87.9.  Of course, all 4 channels now play your selected music just fine.So three stars because the iTrip loses the initial channel upon start up.  Oh, and sometimes it will lose it in the same way if you turn off your car and go to the setting on your car that allows your radio to work while the car is not running.  Interestingly, if you flip the ignition key really fast, it will sometimes stay on the same station.As for general performance, it's not too bad.  I do use it in stereo mode, and most of the time the music plays without interruption.  Sometimes, when pulling into a parking lot, next to a running car, you get static, even though the iTrip is within 3 inches of the radio.  Parking close to some buildings seems to do the same thing (static).  (I'm guessing electrical interference in the walls?)All in all, I am satisfied with this product, and probably would have bought it anyway, even if I knew of the start up problem.  At least it gives me the music I wanted, as my radio does not support plugging in an iPod directly.P.S. I should also note that it works with the iPod nano - 5th generation, but will NOT charge that version of the iPod!!!  It however DOES charge the original classic iPod, and as I have both, that works for me.  That way I can leave the iPod classic in the car, and if somebody steals it, no big deal!

 There's  five day weather forecasts and even safety camera alerts to let you know where speeding and red light cameras are

 The machine only took a minute or two to set up and configure

 I happened on to a screen that told the number of satellites transmitting to the machine and I'm the type that finds details like that interesting
 That same screen shows latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes


 The user guide was much more detailed and helpful than some other Tom Tom products I have seen
 I especially liked the section called "Making Your First Trip"


 I enjoyed the touch and tap screen and the zooming features
The display is a little hard to read in the sunlight especially if for some reason you want to use it outside of the car
 All in all though if you need a new GPS this is a good system.

I use ear buds nearly all day at work, and also while weight training roughly 4 days a week.The main issue I had with these is that I just couldn&amp;#8217;t get a comfortable seal. I tried several combinations with the provided earpieces, but they were constantly loosening up or slipping out of my ears entirely. When I did get them in the right spot, the sound was good, but not great. I tried both the behind the head configuration and the traditional setup. Behind the head really isn&amp;#8217;t practical for weight training since pretty much anytime I laid the back of my head on a bench or a machine they got tugged out of my ears.The other gripe I had was the connectivity issues with my iPhone 5. When I had my phone in my pocket, the music would skip with each step I took. I had to hold my phone in front of me to keep the sound from breaking up; this seems like a disaster for runners. I can&amp;#8217;t entirely say this is the JayBirds fault, but I&amp;#8217;ve never had any Bluetooth issues with my iPhone in the past.While adjusting the volume, it cuts the sound out for a split second every time you push the button.  More of an annoyance than anything, but it gets a little difficult to hear how loud the music will be without a tone.I packed these up and returned them to Amazon a week after trying them out. I can see how these would be a great product for someone with better Bluetooth luck and a decent fit, but for almost $150 it just didn&amp;#8217;t make sense for me. I&amp;#8217;m still on the hunt for the perfect pair of earbuds.

$review_text.: Looked similar to our Devicewear 360 case


Liked the price

It works ok but is nowhere near the quality of the Devicewear case


Lighter, and significantly worse fit

Does not turn as easily as the other one either

For the price it is fine

But you get what you pay for in this case (so to speak).

I ordered it for my asus laptop

My sister needed a new ac adapter, so I bought this for her and it works great! It works on both her Toshiba laptop and my Asus
It's been about a month

No complaints


It does exactly what it is supposed to do
It functions exactly like the original charger that came with my Asus laptop


I highly recommend it to anyone who needs this specific charger.

The 620 features including vibration alerts were beckoning me.  For weeks I delayed buying the 620 because of the negative reviews about the accelerometer and the light screen.  This weekend I finally bought it and today I had my first run.  While it took some time to set up the watch and getting it to work the way I wanted, now that I have more or less figured it out...I really like it.  The touch screen works for me very well and responsively.  The four fields to a screen is great.  The new dynamics are interesting.  I guess that I'll get to judge the watch better over time but so far it was well forth the upgrade.  I can only assume that out of all of the units some there have to be some lemons and those get the nasty reviews.Follow up:  Well three runs in and the watch is excellent.  The GPS works well and gives an accurate result.  The calories reported are lower than with the 410 but that may be a newer algorithm.  Still learning the features but so far happy with my purchase.

$REVIEW.: This battery is the worst. It is made in Hong Kong, take it from my experience and those of other reviews that frequently there are defective cells. I followed the instructions and did the charge/discharge crap which reminded me of old laptop batteries. Eventually this did increase the battery life to what I was hoping for. Well my hope did not last long.Maybe a week, if that, is what the battery was good for. It did not take long for my laptop to just not turn on with the battery in unless I had it pluged in. Now sometimes the battery says 50%, sometimes it is in the 30's... it never shows anything above 50 (rarely even gets to 50). Whenever I turn the laptop off then back on I see a different percent of battery.The only reason I might use the battery now is to elevate my laptop while it is plugged in. If I want to move my laptop I replace the battery before I unplug it. I'm looking for a manufacturer other than Dekcell that has a similar 12-cell battery. If it is going to take 8-15 days to ship then I'm not buying it b/c it may be the same manufacturer.

$REVIEW.: These very comfortable headphones sound quite nice. I used them in an office environment for about three months. I read other reviews which suggested that the cord was fragile, so I was careful with it. Despite its pampered life alternating between my head and a little hook at the top of my cubicle wall, my cord developed a short or gap inside.One minor nuisance is that these have very low impedance, which makes them much louder than other headphones. My PC sound output was often within two or three "notches" of the minimum, which made minor volume adjustments impossible. (If you're set on these, consider an inline volume control such asSennheiser HZR-62. You can use it with other headphones, forever, and it will not have the left-right imbalance at low volumes that a cheaper one-dial volume control would have.)While these headphones lasted, they were nearly perfect; they do shield against outside sounds, but not enough to prevent you from hearing things if you stop the music. They are not so big as to invite comment, and they're not fatiguing nor do they fall off of the head.But the cable doesn't last for very long, even with very careful use. I'm going to try another JVC next, theHARX700 Precision, which should be a lot sturdier, and still comfortable.

 The main reason was to transfer pictures or data from a flash drive with a USB to the iPad


 Every flash drive I used, I got an error message that said the iPad did not have the power to run the USB drive

 Not exactly sure what that means, but the data did not transfer.

$review_text.: I'm using this SSD for a MacBook Pro, and the 512GB capacity makes it an ideal size for speed and portability

Since I already had a backup drive, transferring the data to the new SSD had only the minimal cost for software; in this case, Carbon Copy Cloner


(The Buffalo Mini-Station offered outstanding reliability and decent speed.) Among the advantages:- Boot time was a mere twenty seconds, and speed on video applications was easily halved.- Noticeably lower heat, even when performing demanding video applications.- While TRIM support is standard with Windows, it isn't with Mac SSDs


However, the donate-ware Trim Enabler is mandatory for Mac users.- Initially, some users may find that boot times may be as long as a minute; however, if you choose the Startup Disk in System Preferences, boot time is quite fast

Regardless, I sleep my MBP nearly always.And there are disadvantages:- SSDs are three times the price of traditional drives under the best situation.- Installation is relatively easy, but be aware that this Crucial SSD may have to be installed upside-down.Finally, I suggest you avoid FedEx SmartPost unless you aren't waiting for your package


Shipping may be free, but it's SmartPost is disturbingly slow.

$REVIEW.: I got this lens for my full-frame camera (5D), and it's a great lens to get into wide angle photography - sharp and versatile, plus it's very nicely priced for an L lens.  Be aware that the crop factor of APS sensor cameras makes this lens more of a 27-64mm.  If you have one of these cameras and you really want to have ultra wide-angle capability, you might be better off with something like Canon's EF-S 10-22mm.

$REVIEW.: With great anticipation and enthusiasm I purchased this 46 inch 3D Panasonic which arrived just a few days ago. Firstly let me point out that the Panasonic replaced a SONY XBR television I purchased a few years ago (and a tough act to follow) and was deeply in love with. On setting up the Panasonic I played around with the various video settings and settled on the "Vivid" choice which somewhat brightens the colors making it more to my liking. All the way through I was extremely disappointed with the picture on the Panasonic finding it dull and lifeless. The reds, blues  and greens were all quite muted in color and I do admit that I prefer perhaps somewhat exaggerated somewhat vivid images. The whites were grey and despite all my attempts to correct this tweaking the video settings I was unable to. Interestingly, using the "Brightness" control did nothing at all to the picture as if it wasn't working at all. I saw little to no difference moving the brightness all the way down to all the way up. In addition, I had a similar experience with the "Color" control where it caused little discernible difference from all the way down to all the way up. It was as if these controls weren't working at all.  The 3D glasses were on back order so I never had a chance to sample the 3D, deciding instead to return the TV as quickly as possible. The first flat screen TV I ever purchased (about 10 years ago) was a 42 inch Panasonic Plasma 720p which I was quite satisfied with. In addition,about 2 years ago I purchased another plasma from Panasonic from the G25 series in my opinion performed substantially better then the current ST30 series. As I said before, I quickly decided to return the TV so I will be back to the drawing board to choose my first 3D television. I plan on first looking at the Samsung and SONY LED sets.

$review_text.: Any Cell Phone would have the same limitation as all FRS/GMRS radios, if not for the Cell Towers they communicate with that average 100 feet tall.  GMRS repeaters, mounted on towers or buildings, provide a reliable 10+ mile radius, although only the MR355 version of this radio is repeater capable.  But your average range between two FRS radios shouldn't be expected to exceed 1/2 mile unless you're operating on unobstructed flat terrain which may gain you another mile at best.  Line of site also applies to WiFi, and is why there are 'hotspots'.  Same issues that affect cell phones and WiFi also affect FRS and all other two-way radios in the UHF radio spectrum.  Basically, you create your own 'hotspot' with a pair of walkie-talkies.  I admit the package descriptions are misleading by a long shot.  Stand on top of a skyscraper, and yes, you may get 20 miles with some FRS radios.  I have listened to construction workers in tall buildings and not been able to hear a crane operator on the ground.  Hence line of sight (5 miles or more) was achieved by elevation, and ground level obstructed the others on the construction site.To save your battery life, transmit on 1/2 watt (low power) whenever possible.  My commercial GMRS 5 watt radio only transmits an additional 1/10 of a mile versus my FRS radios.  Antenna height and receiver sensitivity make a bigger difference in useful range than transmitter power.  So, there is little point in getting a GMRS licence when the extra power allowed to use is not that helpful.  I hold an Amateur and GMRS licence, and there is an FCC proposal to do away with the GMRS requirement as there is no enforcement, and almost impossible to enforce being a sort range citizen's band.  Same requirement was dropped for CB long ago.Motorola (Giant International) made a big improvement with the MR350, and most notably in the sound quality.  It's the closest they've come to commercial grade, but I'll never expect that without spending much more on a single radio.  Understanding what your party is saying is as important as range.  The simplest term for describing these is as neighborhood, or site radios.  Unfortunately, some won't even reach across the neighborhood you might live in, but that is a limitation of all radios used in the city.  These are perfectly suited for business use as well.Next thing I noticed right off is these are slightly larger than any other FRS radio I've owned, but still very nice to hold.  They've added a flat bottom to these which now allows them to table stand.  The PTT button is better than ever, as well as battery life.  The built in flashlight is handy too.  Other than that, there isn't much more to mention versus other Motorola's, old or new.  I always carry mine in a nylon holster, which also acts as a wind screen for the microphone.  The included swivel clips will be ok for some users.  I would consider these adult size, and my 9 year old son and his friend prefer the pager sizedTalkabout 2-way radios.  Keep in mind, the Midland radios will be even larger.  I'd recommend these to anyone, and would first make sure they understand what they're intended uses are, and are not.Personally I use FRS to keep in touch with my son as he visits friends in the neighborhood, which also keeps me in touch with the parents.  If it's far enough away that the radio won't reach, he doesn't go alone.  These are the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to keep in touch nearby.  More reliable than texting with his iPod on WiFi.  Knowing the range limitations will keep you from being disappointed with this or any FRS radio.

$REVIEW.: As others have noted, if you have FiOS, you have a MOCA connection on your coax network and this device taps into that to give you Ethernet right over your existing coax lines. The end result is that if you have FiOS, you only need one of these devices for each end point you are trying to add. If you do not already have MOCA on your network, then you will need the Actiontec kit (with two units) to start a MOCA network. Until I found this device, I was struggling to find a decent way to get an Ethernet cable over to my home office which is in an older house, and this turned out to be the perfect solution. While the speeds will not exceed 100Mbps due to the 10/100Mbps interface on the Actiontec device, this speed should be sufficient for most people. High definition video will stream nicely at that speed. I am very pleased with the ease of installation. I hope the device continues to perform well!

$REVIEW.: When I was offered this drive for testing, the first thing that struck me was the 'NAS' designation

 Since I had only the bare drive and my NAS enclosures were already committed, my tests of the drive followed a more conventional pattern


 Before we get to that, let's explore the NAS term

 This refers primarily to the firmware on the drive as well as the disk controller itself


 It's tuned for quieter operation and lower vibration, perhaps making the difference on whether it's acceptable to unobtrusively run the NAS inside an office


The relatively large cache, as well as the 6GB transfer rate, mean that a burst of data can be sent to the drive quickly, allowing the NAS to proceed to the next drive inside the array
The self-maintenance aspects of the firmware also are designed to keep the system running around the clock.My Mac Pro had a spare slot, so my tests were focused on the drive's use as an internal backup

 External backup is critically important, but Apple's Time Machine software can give you a quick and easy way to fix momentary losses
 Once the drive was installed, I could see that it rotates at 5900 RPM rather than the more typical 5400 RPM of so-called 'Green' drives
 This is too slow for a main system drive (which should be 7200 RPM or greater), but is a noted improvement over 5400.No drive goes into my system without a complete surface test

 Such a test not only checks the disk for surface integrity, but also gives some good clues about thermal performance under load as well as sustained speed
 Tests on my 3TB drive completed in just over 5 hours, which is quite good
 Testing the drive for speed (with an appropriate diagnostic application) gave me pretty consistent numbers above 130MB/sec


 This is below the Seagate-quoted spec, but specs are idealized

 The speeds I reached were actually quite good for a low-speed disk--just below the 150 MB/sec of a RAID-0 pair of 5400 RPM drives in my system


 This drive is more than adequate for the backup application I had in mind
 I also believe this would be an excellent performer inside a NAS array or any other sort of RAID structure.

$REVIEW.: The same thickness as a pack of smokes, and slightly wider and taller, this compact battery packs a decent wallop.  It's not perfect, but it's close.There are two built-in cables (red) - for convenience. While these are handy, they have issues - that's why only four stars. They provide less amperage than the built-in USB port. Even more annoying, the Lightning cable won't stay in the battery. I would up bending the corner of the battery back a little so it would grab better.As I mentioned, there's a built-in USB port. For some reason, this charges faster - so it gets more amperage.  If you provide your own USB cable you can charge your devices about 2x faster.There's no power button - the device automatically starts charging whatever device you attach. To see the current battery charge, tap the pack. I found that it took a decent rap with my knuckles. There are four blue LED's that indicate the current charge level, each representing 25%.  Four lights=100% - pretty simple.It's a convenient and compact design with a couple of minor issues. 8400 mAh for the price is a pretty good deal.

The material comes packaged in two layers of clear plastic shrink wrap. The clips on the screen back are strong enough to hold it to the back of the screen, but they don't really dig into the aluminum to mar it, and that made me really happy. The material itself isn't a tinted translucent, and it is solidly dyed through. However, the Apple logo still glows through it, just not as bright. The cover adds about 1mm around the screen.The bottom cover has some grill cut outs to let heat build up escape, and some white foam feet that aren't as sturdy as the built in black ones from Apple. Also, the bottom cover has a lip that extends about 1mm above the edge of the actual MacBook Pro edge, and it's a little uncomfortable for my wrists, so I don't keep it on for longer typing sessions. Removability isn't bad at all; I never felt like I was damaging the MacBook Pro taking it off or putting it on. I think it gives adequate protection, but I'm a little concerned about trapping heat that could potentially damage the internals. I'm going to experiment with the bottom cover a bit more, and I hope Mosiso can mill down the bottom cover lip without it falling off.Overall, I'm impressed with the Mosiso cover. It's really well made and fits well, and the rubberized material has a great level of color depth on the Robin's Egg Blue / Hot Blue version. It feels really good in the hand and not slippery at all.

On my workstation with USB 3.0, I can get upwards of 80-90 MB/s write speed with large files (&gt;4GB).

$REVIEW.: We purchased this for an office along with a 55&amp;#34; Sony KDL-55W802A so that we would have a portable entertainment cart and move it to conference rooms or out on the floor with a PC connected to display high resolution images and content, as well as play some video games.  The cart was fairly easy to put together, although the shelf is a bit flimsier then I expected.  Probably not an issue for most people putting a basic game console or blu-ray player on the shelf, but we have a PC on there so it's a bit shaky.  It's not going to fall or anything, but something to keep in mind.  The actual mount holds the TV firmly and securely, and the lock is a nice touch to prevent people from messing with it too much and moving the TV.The 55&amp;#34; TV is perfectly steady and was extremely easy to mount as well.  The stand is a bit on the shorter side, but it's not too bad.  The TV sits at about eye level for me standing straight up, and i'm 5'7&amp;#34;.  So it's not the tallest thing display cart if you want something big and more visible, but it's adequate for basic viewing.  No issues with the wheels either, the cart moves around great and smoothly, and the locks were fine to keep it in place as well.  The steel construction is very solid and well built, so I have no worries about this falling apart anytime soon.Overall, highly recommended if you need your TV to be portable.

Strangely compared to its big size, it is relatively light! The programming is easy, and I was able to put all my devices into this remote. It is a good functional remote, but the quality could have been much better.

I still have it. Its design is great as has already been covered here. Very nice and compact package with an ingenious design for the final adjustment. HOWEVER, on my unit, which is all black and no red as pictured, the tapered pinch piece on the end of the tightening knob is plastic and after only a few uses cracked and popped out the back. Now it only tightens part of the way before spinning. SO BE VERY CAREFUL tightening the knob in case this happens to you. Hopefully the newer designs replaced this piece with metal.

I don't think I've completely drained it once yet despite 16 hr flights.  It takes a while to charge completely but that should be expected given its capacity.  It's very hard to find a comparable product with this capacity and that performs this well at this price point.  It actually works better than some of the more expensive products I've tried.

All headphone preferences are specific to the listener, but these take that concept to the Nth degree.  So be very mindful that this is just one man's perspective.Appearance: Gorgeous.  'nuff said.  I consider these the best looking cans in the business.  But meh, I'd take a great sounding ugly pair than a horrible sounding attractive pair.  I'm still talking about headphones of course, but I jest.Sealed vs Closed:  these terms are too often used interchangeably, but we all know that not all closed headphones seal.  To me, sealing means that you don't hear the outside environs and others around you don't hear what you are listening to.  When you are in public, you don't want your cans to leak out.  Let's admit it, we all have our guilty pleasure songs that we don't want to admit we keep on our portable music players, beyond the fact that it is just plain rude to your neighbors.  And when you are on a plane, you don't want to hear the crying baby over your cans(isolation).  So if you are looking for a high-quality set of cans that can travel with you, you want "sealed".  For example, the denons are closed cans, but leak sound like crazy with very little isolation from your external environs.  So they are FAR from sealed.  These AKGs I safely report are closed and sealed.  They are great for isolation and limited leakage when you are not alone.32Ohms: Low impedance cans are often times associated with low-end.  But that is far from the truth. Low-Impedance determines how easy it is to power the music.  If you plug in a high impedance set of cans directly into an iphone for example, the volume with be really low and the sound quality will be horrible.  But use that same iphone and use an amp with it, you will greatly enhance the listening pleasure of high impedance headphones.  Generally speaking, ALL cans should benefit from a good DAC/AMP set up, but those with Ohm ratings higher than approximately 100 will REQUIRE a headphone AMP.  A lot of home theater receivers have a great built-in headphone amp, but no computer sound card can truly power a high impedance set of cans(NOT even the Xonar).  Some examples of good low impedance cans are denons, ATH M50, MDR-V6, and Sennheiser HD-25ii.  The AKG K550 is 32Ohms, so any portable device will power it fine without an amp.  They sound great with my Cowon Plenue Z2.  They sound decent connected directly to my laptop.  They sound great for music, movie, and games.  BUT!!! they sound MUCH better with an amp.  In other words, these headphones scale beautifully with a GOOD DAC/AMP.  The more juice you give it, the more it shines.  So although, they are low imp cans, and therefore, work great without an amp, they benefit GREATLY when juiced.SOUND QUALITY:  So why would you want these headphones?  Let's not get it twisted, these cans will never replace my home set up.  In the isolation of my place, I love the experience of putting on a nice set of open-back cans while sipping some wine or scotch.  BUT...I travel a lot and need a nice SEALED headphone that isolates and does not leak.  I used to use the MDR-V6 by Sony.  Great cans with 63Ohms rating.  But the sound stage is small and the sound is a bit too analytical.  Don't get me wrong, they're fantastic, but I've always had my eyes open for a better set of sealed cans.  ATH M50 by audio technica is one of the most highly regarded sealed, low-impedance cans, along with the Senns HD25s, but i wanted a set of cans that rivaled the sound stage of an open-back set of headphones.  So these cans deliver the sound stage?  sort of.  The sound stage is good, really good.  In fact, they're the best I've ever heard from a closed-back headphone.  But they still don't have the vast sound-stage of a truly open-back set of headphones.  A lot of people say these are a bit weak in the bass department.  These aren't Beats.  The bass won't overwhelm you, but it is solid and clear.  Some songs where I know the bass is loud, i turn down my amp in anticipation.  I like protecting my hearing and you can actually feel the air of the bass on certain songs.  The midrange is a bit inconsistent.  There are odd spikes that soften over time(I will discuss burn-in later).  Some parts of the midrange sound recessed, and other parts overemphasized.  The highs are clear and balanced with the rest of the sound spectrum.  All-in-all, these are a really fun pair of headphones.  No part of the spectrum is ignored.  And often times, you will hear things you have never noticed in a song before.  I have never heard some songs sound so interesting.  "Wake Me Up When September Ends" by Greenday is an example of such a song.  For the most part, these cans are exact in their delivery, so good audio sources and good audio recordings will be critical when listening to these.  Some of my less inspiring digital files are left nearly unlistenable.FIT:  Often times when I review headphones, I'll just say, "comfortable for continuous use".  AKG K550s need a LOT more in-depth discussion regarding fit.  I have never used a pair of headphones that required such precise fit.  First off, these cans are out-of-the-box designed for big heads.  With a little bending of the headband, they can be modified to fit smaller heads.  If you lose the seal, the sound quality goes down the toilet.  Much like IEMs, these full-sized cans require a great seal to deliver the intended sound, bass especially.  I think the design/fit would be greatly enhanced by increasing the padding in the rear of pads.  Angled kind of like the Q701s.  As big as these are, and as reliant on seal as these are, it is a big oversight to not add features that enahnce the seal.  For me, these work great b/c I have a big head.  But if you got a little noggin, then be prepared to do some bending.BURN-IN:  Placebo or real?  I have wondered if I just got used the sound of a pair of headphones or if headphones really changed over time.  I've always believed it was a combination of the two.  UNTIL NOW.  These headphones are the greatest evidence that burn-in is REAL I've ever heard.  When I first got these, before even burning them in, I listened to them.  And the sound was so odd that I almost gave up on them.  There were odd spikes and sometimes ear-piercing peaks.  The electric guitar in songs sounded just horrible, scratch and distorted.  But like all headphones I get, I decided to burn them in.  I first used medium volume and put my music library on random.  These cans I think can greatly benefit from white and pink noise, although I didn't use that method.  Even with the medium volume burn-in, i didn't get the results I wanted.  So I cranked up the volume on my amp to max and burned them in for and additional 50+ hours.  Most of my issues with these cans disappeared.  There is still a note or two in the upper-mids that spikes and hurts my ear, but I hope this goes away in time.  The electric guitar sounds a lot better now, even the loud strumming electric.  I would highly recommend burning in these THOROUGHLY at loud volumes before judging these cans.CONCLUSION:  These are not the best headphones in the world.  I will use them at home some times to mix things up, but I will use them predominantly for use on the road.  And for this purpose, it is my opinion that these are the best headphones.  Great soundstage, great representation of the entire frequency range(minus a couple of upper-mid spikes), and SEALED(not just closed).  I recommend them for a good all-purpose headphones.  If you plan to only buy one set of headphones and use them for everything at home and on the road, then this is a good option.  If you listen to a ton of electric guitar music(especially strumming wall-of-sound electric guitar), like speed metal, I highly recommend you stay away from these.  Although, this is changing over time as songs like "Paradise City" by G&amp;R; and "Creep" by Radiohead are sounding better after a thorough burn-in.  "Tom Sawyer" by Rush is sounding amazing.  I haven't heard drums sound this good.*UPDATE*As I am traveling for work, I am away from my home set up.  But I have received my Asgard and Bifrost from Schiit.  So I have finally gotten to test these cans with a decent amp/dac combination.  The Asgard/Bifrost combo has a very warm sound signature.  My set up now: laptop to SPDIF optical to Schiit Bifrost to RCA to Asgard to AKG K550.  Absolutely amazing.  Source material is sooooo important.  And by source material, I am counting everything before the AMP.  That includes the music files and the DAC.  People stress headphones and amp, but they forget how important a good source is.  Garbage in garbage out I say.  Anyhow, I digress.  With this setup and a mild equalization change to favor bass and reduce the upper-mids(4kHz-8kHz), the AKG K550s have THRIVED!!!  These cans sound so NATURAL.  A guitar sounds like a live guitar (both electric and acoustic).  Drums are fast and thunderous.  Vocals are resonant and textured.  The sound stage is absolutely incredible now.  I am raising my 4 star rating to 5 star.  Mind you, I've considerably burned these in also.  These cans as I've stated above require an incredible amount of burn-in.  These cans are now playing everything I throw at it.  VERY versatile.  Even the upper mid spikes are going away if not completely gone.  If you are to own just one set of cans, these are them.  These cans thrive with a good set up, but will work with a bad one too.

$REVIEW.: I have too many USB devices to plug in to my PC at one time. It also seems like each device has its own special cable. I really dislike pulling my PC out and disconnecting one USB cable to swap it for another. With the Plugable USB hub hooked up, I have enough ports to leave all of my USB device cables plugged in all the time. I have not had any problems charging devices, and everything I plug in is immediately recognized. This is a well built and well laid out unit. I would buy this product gain.

$REVIEW.: I had high expectations for this camera, which I shopped for very carefully once my first digital camera (a 4mp EasyShare) began acting up. More megapixels, more zoom, image stabilization... it all sounded good.But after taking a number of sample pictures, I'm disappointed, and the camera is going back. I even read the manual... yes... I went that far... and reduced the image size, but I took a pile of pictures under various lighting conditions (in Easy mode), and the pictures just didn't seem that significantly better than that of my Kodak. (I took pictures side by side of the same things.) I will use advanced features from time to time, but honestly, if it's supposed to function well in Easy mode and it doesn't, that's a lost sale for me.Yes, the LCD is huge, but the small LCD on my Kodak is much crisper and brighter. The display on the FZ7 is so grainy that it's hard to see what I'm photographing.  I also don't like that I have to push a switch to toggle between viewfinder and LCD, instead of having both available simultaneously.I also told myself that I really wouldn't mind moving from Easyshare, but you know what? After fiddling with this camera for a day, I miss simply docking the camera to recharge it or transfer pictures. Kodak got that right, at least for this customer. I also agree that not being able to use regular batteries in a pinch is a drawback. The first point is not so much Panasonic's problem, it's a preference; the second point is more universal.On the other hand, the camera seems well-made, it's attractive, it has a nice grip, the buttons and toggles are all well placed, the lens cap is intelligently designed (you won't lose it unless you're trying to), and overall this camera seems to offer a number of features that are nice for this price range. I feel bad giving the DMC-FZ7 this review, because I had a Panasonic film camera for 17 years (it didn't break, I lost it in 2004) and it took many, many wonderful pictures. I was hoping to resume being a Panasonic camera fan. Darn. Back to the drawing board.

$REVIEW.: I have an SB400 Speedlight, which I highly recommend, however it eats AA alkaline batteries.  I haven't found any rechargeables that can really stand up to its hunger for power.  So I have been looking for a "Softbox" solution for the built in flash for those instances when I forget to bring a backup pair of AA's for the SB400.This product is very simple to use.  The bracket fits perfectly into the hotshoe of my D40 and doesn't impede the popup flash.  If does a good job of softening the light to really fuzz out the harsh shadows.  It does limit the range of the flash as any softbox will do.  But for closeups, portraits and indoor shots where your subject isn't too far away it makes a world of difference.  It really helps to bring out the natural tones without washing out your subject.The build quality seems decent for a </review_text><review_summary>Wearing out after 4 years</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2WZ37LJG3GVR2"><latest_review_date>08/01/2007</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0033BU0F8</product_id><review_date>08/01/2007</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Gorgeous yet protects at the same time!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2WZRBFLJESCSH"><latest_review_date>13/05/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004AXDFFA</product_id><review_date>13/05/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>excellent card</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2X06FP2PQ6EK0"><latest_review_date>06/10/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00B272TO0</product_id><review_date>06/10/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>I get about 27 station near Sacramento in real High Definition, Mounted in Attic</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2X1P0X7QRPN8P"><latest_review_date>28/01/2010</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0013OWPV4</product_id><review_date>28/01/2010</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Low quality</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2X3L31KCXBHCL"><latest_review_date>05/04/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004H065LM</product_id><review_date>05/04/2012</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 2]</review_helpful><review_text>I purchased this to use a Nikon lens on my Canon body and the adapter surely works.

As other reviewers said, it's difficult to remove it from the lens. This doesn't bother me too much since I only use it on Canon or on Sony nex through adapter, and I don't need to take it off. consider a different adapter if you have both Canon and Nikon cameras.This is ideal if you have a Canon camera and you can leave this adapter on the lens most (if not all) of the time. If I owned more than one Nikon lens, I would definitely buy multiple copies of this adapter and avoid using only one on all of them.

$review_text.: Seeing that the Canon version is over 170 dollars, i decided to buy Meike since i bought for my 50D. I just got it today and im happy with the purchase again. It feels great and although the button and wheel is a bit less smoother, its not bad at all. It feels great and the rubberized part feels similar to the body itself. Ive had my Meike battery grip on my 50D for a year and a half and have no problems with it. Just make sure you get the proper batteries! The Watson works well with this grip as well as the official Canon batteries.

First of all the design is very slim and enhances the iPad Air rather than detracting from the lightness and slim form factor

 The white color is a perfect match for the white iPad


The workmanship and finish of the case is top notch


 The holes all align perfectly and the magnets work fine


Also, the designers thought of it all - they even made the cover just very slightly overlap the iPad so it's easy to open it and you don't have to go digging around with your fingernail.I did order another genuine leather case with the original Apple style as I like the no fuss and simplicity of the stand function where the cover fits into the tab in the back.Unless the leather case is superb, this Poetic case and the other red one I ordered will be my go to cases.

However, viewing angles from above &amp; below the level line of site are really bad (maybe limited to +47 degrees &amp; -47 degrees). Horizontal viewing angles on my set were very good (perhaps 80 degrees left and 80 degrees right). So mine is not really usable at upper book shelf or top of refrigerator elevations, if viewers are in a seated position. Picture color and sharpness are both very good, contrast in low-light scenes leaves something to be desired, and sound is excellent for given speaker size. I would probably buy it again, but not for the same planned usage that I had for this one. As usual, Amazon.com shipping was prompt and without any damage.

$review_text.: I expected a lot more from this device.I expected it to at least perform as well as the older 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter TL-WN722N I was using in my Windows PC. In the past wireless PCI devices have always been faster and more reliable than any usb wireless device I have used. That is not the case with this device.It may be the software to blame since it didn't give me a first good impression. First of all, in Windows 7 64 bit it said it would only install the driver and not the rest of the software, and even after I installed it would randomly connect. The signal was also weaker than with the 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter TL-WN722N, which was hard to believe since this device has 3 antenna's instead of just 1 like my old device! Anyways, so I tried using it in Windows 8 to see if that fared any better but no it was worse! First off make sure you don't use the driver included on the CD unless you want a BSOD and have to try to recover the OS! Make sure you do a manual install of the drivers only in Windows 8 if you want to try it out. Officially there is no Windows 8 support for this device. Not that it matters much because even after I finally got it to work without crashing my computer the signal and performance wasn't any better than with Windows 7. I'm talking about 1/2 the speed I was getting with my older device so if I"m lucky I'll get 1/2 meg of bandwdith with 2 bars whereas with my old usb stick I consistently get 3 bars and up to 3.5MB/sec from my wireless router which is located about 100 feet away.Hopefully, there will be an official Windows 8 driver release which will not only work properly but fix the performance issues, until then I've gone back to my older and more reliable usb wireless device. Or maybe I just got a bum card since most other reviews of this card seem to be pretty positive?

It's much nicer then the bag it replaced and far more attractive. If your someone who wants lots of pockets and zippered storage you might not like this bag. If you keep it simple this bag will work well for you.

It was super easy to install and my new video card is happy. My computer is on 24/7 and for the last 5 months anyway, the power supply has been humming along happily.

$review_text.: Just installed these speakers into my 2002 Ford Taurus last night, so far very pleased with the purchase. For those looking to upgrade the factory ford 5x7/6x8 speakers, this is a great choice..The install went well, speakers fit into factory holes without any struggle. I did zip tie the speaker wires/connector to the front speakers so they can't get hung up in the window.The adjustable tweeter is a very nice feature, I turned them all to +3, and rotated towards me.Overall the speakers sound very nice and clear, much better than factory. The bass isn't anything to speak of, but I have separate subs for that task. These speakers matched up with subs sound awesome. I'm powering them with a Kenwood deck, 22rms watts. The speakers are loud and clear, didn't break up as I expected at higher levels. May even put an amp on these for more power.Get some at this price!

$REVIEW.: 2012 Travel Zoom Digital Camera Round-UpWay, way back in 2009, a lengthy group test of pocketable long-zoom travel cameras was performed by one of the most popular sources for digital camera reviews. It was only three years ago and the camera specifications were all within a narrow range: The tested cameras all had 10 - 12MP CCD sensors, zoom ability was 10x-12x, none could record video at full 1080 HD, and most screens were of the 230k pixel, 2.7 inch to 3 inch variety. The winners in that match-up happened to be Panasonics, with Panasonic ZS-3 having a street price of $380 or thereabouts, at that "ancient" time.Onto 2011, where another, larger group test was conducted. The cameras as a class offered BSI (back side illumination) sensors more often, LCD screen resolution was improved to 460k (or better) and the long zoom notion was no longer 10x, but 14x to the (at that time) 18x Nikon S9100 as the class leader in the zoom department. GPS units were added as a "feature" and the winners were the Canon SX230 (a verdict I agree with) and the Nikon S9100 which I personally found to be a spectacular disaster of a camera.It is just a year later, and BSI sensors have become standard fare, claimed to be twice as sensitive as the CCD variety. The 14x zoom of the 2011 Canon SX230, actually a fine camera, now seems anemic compared to the 16x - 20x base capabilities of the current crop. I don't particularly subscribe to putting a price on a memory, but as a bonus 2012 compact long zooms, despite having more expensive sensors, greater usable magnification ranges, better video capability, and more features the price of entry is no more, often less than three years ago.Some of the common "complaints" about this class of camera are nonsensical. You'll redundantly hear about the lack of an EVF, the electronic viewfinders, RAW capture (meaning s-l-o-w with the intent of post-processing) and some equally nonsensical carping about low-light. The reason to enjoy this class of camera is that it fits in a shirt pocket, weighs one half pound or less, and has long zoom capability. If you don't care about bulk, heft, and zoom range . . . you are looking at the completely wrong platform of camera for your needs. The camera in your pocket captures the event when the others are not with you. A seven ounce camera is more pleasant to carry than a two or four pound hunk of equipment; a 16x zoom offers composition possibilities that no 3.8x, 4x, and 5x zoom can possibly match.Of more importance is shooting performance, handling, overall speed. No one wants a camera they have to wait for-- by then, the shot you wanted may already have ceased to exist. Image stabilization ability is also a very important component of this class of camera. There are only three basic components: lens, sensor, processor. The software / cpu combination is often designated as an "engine," with a newer bit of programing called a better version of the engine. How they work together, under the most diverse circumstances, is what makes for the satisfying travel compact long zoom. The basics, in 2012, for a camera to qualify as a modern compact travel zoom appears to be 15x zoom or better, a BSI sensor, and at least some HD video capability.Of the last dozen cameras I've spent quality time with over the last year, few actually qualify as those that I can confidently recommend. The 2011 Canon SX230 is one, as is the current enhanced zoom (20x) 2012 Canon SX260. The 2012  Panasonic ZS-15 is another, perhaps the most well-rounded and versatile value out there to this point. The unevenly performing Fuji F660EXR was a failboat with the horrific video performance sending it soundly to the cannot recommend list.Now comes a final 2012 model long-zoom compact, the Samsung WB750. It is easy to confuse the WB750 with the Wi-Fi version, the WB750F, but they are different cameras with different sensors: the "F" edition has a 14.2 MB CCD type sensor, not the 12.5 MB BSI CMOS of the WB750. The WB750F also lacks full HD video, stereo audio, the slow-motion video modes, and so forth. It is easy to confuse the two, my feeling is that Samsung could have made the differences far more easy to discern. Yet, the $350 or so W850F model does have a BSI sensor, further adding to the muddle.Sensor size is perhaps the best barometer of image potential, though the industry seems to go to great lengths to disguise it. More megapixels on a tiny surface means each photosite gets less light, must be smaller, and  there is more opportunity for signal cross-talk. Yet, the number of megapixels has long been touted, though more megapixels tends to diminish image quality potential.The WB750 was actually announced September 1, 2011, to little fanfare. The original press release stated, "Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today announced the launch of the WB750 camera - featuring a proprietary BSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS sensor that ensures consistent professional images and video. Featuring a newly-redesigned image sensor, lens and image processor, the WB750 brings to bear a range of new technologies to deliver unprecedented levels of performance and ease-of-use. The WB750 also features an 18x optical zoom with 24x Smart Zoom technology, making it the longest ever zoom in Samsung's compact camera portfolio."  Rightly or wrongly, mostly wrongly, we tend to pay more attention to brand names than actual product. It tends to mean that Sony, Nikon, Canon, and Panasonic get better coverage whether deserved or not. Such is the blinding power of the mythical world of product branding.While the specifications of the Samsung WB750 would have been astounding a year prior to its original announcement, most of them in July, 2012, fit the middle of the road. A year ago, the 18x zoom would have been equaled by very few, such as the frustratingly bad Nikon CoolPix S9100 I tried to work with, that sounded like a tractor when I used it, had erratic image stabilization for stills and no effective image stabilization for video. The WB750 has essentially a 24-432mm range, wider than many, has a panoramic feature that Canon still doesn't, and offers smaller image size high-speed video that many lack: 440fps @ 224x160 and 250fps @ 368x272 pixels. In night scene mode, the shutter speed goes all the way down to 16 seconds if you prefer.For purposes of comparison, I'm pitting the Samsung WB750 primarily against the Panasonic ZS-15, perhaps my favorite travel zoom to date.Battery life: Panasonic wins, though not by much at 260 shots vs. 225 for the WB750 (CIPA standard). Both have in-camera charging, requiring the purchase of an external charger to avoid taking the camera out of commission by plugging it in.Lens:  f/3.2 - f/5.8, 18x, 24mm-432mm for the Samsung vs. F3.3 - F5.9, 16x, 24mm-384 mm for the ZS-15. Advantage Samsung, for the slightly brighter lens and longer true optical zoom, though neither "advantage" is apparent to me.Size: At 4.15 in. x 2.34 in x .98 inch thick  and a weight of 6.7 oz., the Samsung  is notably slimmer than the 6.6 oz. 4.13 x 2.27 x 1.31 inch Panasonic ZS-15.  The stated thickness is misleading from both companies, as the cameras are thicker through the lens portion than published. The Samsung is still the thinner camera, if minimally.LCD: Both have 460K three inch LCD's. They are close, a slight edge to the Panasonic for its "high angle mode."Price: The Samsung is currently available at $150 - $170 street, clearly less than the $190 - $230 recent pricing of the Panasonic ZS-15. For the record, I actually paid $150 for my WB750 vs. $230 for my ZS-15. This isn't exactly dinner, dancing, and Chilean Sea Bass money difference but still-- the Samsung is currently a better value by a clean forty dollars, if it does what you want it to do.Video: The Samsung is more fully featured with stereo sound and high-speed capabilities. Also, the full18x true optical zoom is available during video as well. The WB750 allows taking a few *full* resolution stills during video where the Panasonic captures two total in 3.5M (16:9) reduced resolution. The Samsung's fast zoom easily outruns its autofocus ability. However, the Samsung picks up far less camera noise with the "Sound Alive" on and as a result, it has superior audio quality.Shooting Performance: Start-up times to first shot are both quick, 1.6 seconds for the Panasonic vs. 1.7 seconds for the Samsung. The Panasonic, if anything seems to focus faster but both are reasonably quick. Neither camera is going to keep you waiting; both offer 10fps burst modes if only for a limited number of frames at full resolution: 4 frames for the Panasonic, 8 frames for Samsung at 10fps. Shot to shot times are similar, about one second for the ZS-15, about 1-1/4 seconds for the Samsung. The Samsung gives you a brief "processing" screen more often than the ZS-15 does. The Panasonic is far peppier when using the flash at 2 seconds vs. 3 seconds or so for the Samsung. The slow-charging flash of the Samsung is a negative.Videography: Travel zooms, as a class, are very poor substitutes for camcorders. The audio invariably picks up some motor noise and due to the pathetically small mics, audio quality is limited with no possibility of using an external mic. Still, some are better than others with a recently tested Fuji F660EXR yielding uniformly tragic results. Yet, the Samsung has the cleanest audio of the long-zoom compacts I've tested this year.Unlike many travel zooms (Canon SX230) both the Panasonic ZS-15 and the Samsung can take a few stills while you are recording video. In the case of the ZS-15, the value is dubious to non-existent. In an indoor, very low-light test I found that the ZS-15 captured very clear, sharp, ISO 1000 stills. You get but two still captures in video mode, they are 3.5M, and used under the same conditions they were not only low-resolution, but captured at a horribly grainy ISO 3200. Most small travel zooms pick up motor noise when zooming: it is to be expected. The best solution is avoid zooming as much as possible, or displace the audio with music, etc. Samsung at least recognizes this with a "Sound Alive On" mode that is designed to reduce zoom noise. It does work, actually far better than I expected. While the Samsung does have stereo mics, this advantage is primarily a "spec-sheet only" benefit in a compact travel zoom with tiny onboard mics that can offer minimal stereo separation. Nevertheless the Samsung shines brightly in audio quality compared to the Panasonic.The current notion of wanting, much less needing 1080p capture from a non-dedicated still camera is silly, more marketing than beneficial. Too soon we forget the movies we enjoyed, and still enjoy from the "lousy" DVD format: 29.97 fps, 480 interlaced resolution. Yet, DVD is still the dominate medium in market share. Resolution alone is a very poor indicator of video quality. Consider that even the full HD of 1080 rates only as low resolution in still image terms. The native resolution of the Panasonic ZS-15 sensor is 4000x3000, I suppose we'd call it 3000p if it was video, the native resolution of this Samsung is 4096x3072.Clearly, the notion of sensor native resolution does not translate into any meaningful measure of video prowess, nor does the resolution of the video mode itself. In a compact long zoom, the best that can be hoped for is in-focus moving images with good color fidelity, the notion of excellent audio quality is a myth. This is why, from a video perspective, there isn't too much to get excited about here, nor could there be. The best video is obtained when not zooming at all and with the use of a tripod for full zoom. Even then, audio quality can only be amateurish. The edge in video goes to the Samsung, as full-resolution images can be taken while in video mode, and the Samsung offers more fun novelty-type modes, including high-speed capture.ConclusionsThe Samsung WB750 comes as an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. Prices vary for all kinds of reasons with digital cameras but I can't call the WB750 at $150 - $170 anything less than a spectacularly good bargain. It joins the Panasonic ZS-15 and the Canon SX260 as the only compact long-zooms I can recommend to anyone seeking this platform of camera.The Panasonic "Intelligent Zoom" does retain image sharpness better than its competitors when exceeding its true optical limitation; Samsung has a "24x Smart Zoom" that is essentially an in-camera crop. There is a curve of diminishing returns when magnifying images: I'm just not clever enough to be able to tell you what it is. The "long zoom" compact used to be 10x, but I certainly have had several instances where that proved insufficient. Even last year's Canon SX230, a very competent unit, seems underpowered compared to all three of these despite its 14x zoom. Twenty-eight percent more zoom ability in the WB750 vs. the SX230 is substantial but the eleven percent additional of the SX260 vs. the WB750 is far less noticeable. Note the Canon lens is F3.5 wide-angle to F6.8, a bit slower than either the Samsung or the Panasonic, but in real-world terms this isn't a noticeable difference. They are all competitive; where the true optical zoom becomes the most noticeable is during video capture, something that none of the three do superbly well. Those that want the 20x of the Canon and think the GPS is of value could be easily swayed. In my terms, for my uses, the Samsung and the Panasonic are better fits.The Samsung is a slight winner in pocketability, with a thickness of just under an inch, in at least some areas. Both of the others are about 30% thicker in places: the Samsung can be slipped in where the others cannot.The display is vital for shot composition. All three have generally good, 460K displays. The Panasonic display is more reflective, yet that is combated by Power LCD" and "High Angle" modes. The Samsung has an auto mode, but gives you three basic choices: normal, dark, and bright. It doesn't sound as sexy or technological as "Power LCD" but it is the same idea. Canon features the "PureColor II G" LCD, which also imposes a bit of needless technobabble.  Non are as good as the higher-resolution, 921k screens, as good as the fold out and swivel "articulated" LCDs, or nearly as good as an EVF in bright sunlight. Yet, they are all larger (3 inch) than the standard fare of a couple of years ago and are double the pixels of the screens of a couple of years ago as well. None are anywhere close to perfection in bright, sunny conditions but all are improved and far more helpful when reviewing images prior to transfer to your PC.If you feel a GPS is invaluable or the 20x optical zoom is vital, then the Canon SX260 will likely be your choice. Neither of these features are particularly important to me, the GPS of precisely zero benefit, so for me . . . the SX260 would be a 3rd place choice, yet it is a very, very good long-zoom compact with no great negatives to stop the purchase excepting price, although by some (Sony) levels, the Canon seems a strong value.That leaves the ZS-15 and the Samsung and it is a very difficult to find a clear winner. I can't shake the feeling that if this Samsung had "Sony" branded on it, it would have already have been heralded as the marvel of the age and the loudest screaming deal of screaming deals. It is a sleeper in the compact long zoom class, largely ignored compared to competitive models without solid basis that I Have been able to discover.Yet, the all-round shooting performance of the ZS-15 is faster than the Samsung; the ZS-15 processor is clearly quicker. The Samsung creative modes are surprisingly good, the audio is better, and the full-resolution still ability during video is of clear value. The Samsung rendition of the Panorama mode is excellent; up / down / left / right, just move the camera and the WB750 does the rest. And, you have more smart filters to experiment with as well as high-speed video.The all-around winner, for my purposes, is the Panasonic ZS-15, with a higher percentage of "keeper" photos than the rest in a variety of conditions. The Samsung WB750 remains a great value, as it is both feature-laden, economical, and takes very good video if you lay off the zoom and the audio is actually very clean. For indoor use, it falls behind both Panasonic and Canon for its turtle-slow to charge up flash, and both weak and unpredictable color saturation and cast. You can get decent indoor pictures with the Samsung, but all too often it is a slow and tedious process.The Panasonic ZS-15 wins, the Samsung remains a surprisingly good value best suited for outdoor use and also if the audio quality of your video is important to you. The Canon SX260 gets the nod if you want a GPS, is still a very worthy travel companion, but it lacks in the video department, and does not have the manual controls of either of the more economical choices, nor a panorama mode.In the value department, the WB750 is very hard to fault and the full-resolution during video ability is something most of its competition lacks. Nevertheless, its shooting performance is only average compared to the ZS-15 and SX260: the ZS-15 @ fifty bucks more, the SX260 at about twice the price.For video ability and 18x zoom value, the Samsung does well. Six-eight months ago, it would have been far more appealing though, as today (12/2012) the ZS-15 is a better still-image camera with prices now running as low as </review_text><review_summary>"M"ediocre-Audio</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A2Y4DU3VZ6M153"><latest_review_date>17/06/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B001FN3ZRQ</product_id><review_date>17/06/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>AMAZING DEAL</review_summary></review><review><product_id>B000WGJX5A</product_id><review_date>18/07/2012</review_date><review_helpful>[1, 1]</review_helpful><review_text>I've had these earbuds for over a year and they have held up great.

It's not invisible. You can tell it's on your device. And that's a good thing all around.There is no color to the shield, but it has a somewhat greasy looking gloss to it. By greasy, I mean, it's not super reflective - so it's got great viewability in the sun. The skin also grips a lot better than any other skin I've seen - so it just sits in your hand with great stability  (like a rubber skin). At the same time though, finger strokes over the screen are smooth and don't stick.The key, however, is the scratch protection. After 9 months of getting tossed around in my book bag, the screen on my ipod touch looks the same as the day I applied the invisibleshield. The video clips and those crazy guys at the mall are not lying. this shield will take a beating and "heal" itself of any superficial slices/scratches whatever. Any other screen protector would resist small scratches, but hold onto the deeper ones - and gradually build up over time, until it needed to be replaced.BOTTOM LINE: The InvisibleShield comes with a lifetime warranty, but you won't use it. This screen protector will last for the life of your device. (And will make it easier to use the device too.)

$REVIEW.: ThisAmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hubis a solid little gem for those who frequently have to pack and go in a flash. I needed USB expansion for my13-inch Apple MacBook Pro, as it is limited in its native state to only two USB 2.0 ports. Had been caught in the field without my regular USB hub recently due to rushing and packing too fast, but when I saw this one here, with all of the positive reviews, just had to grab it.Likes:+ Unpowered four-port hub; works on PCs and Macs alike+ Convenient; three USB ports in front, one in back+ Ample cord length, about 10- inches (27cm)+ Extra-bright orange LED; easy to see that the hub is functional+ Compact flat design; fits in notebook bags easily+ Easy to open recyclable cardboard box+ Excellent priceDislikes:- None so farIn Use:Should note that my needs for a USB hub are simple. I play no games nor do I connect any high-end audio devices to my computer. But my hub needs to be able to reliably connect to and back up date on my 500GB external hard drive, and this is essential. It also has to charge and back up my BlackBerry Curve. Further, it has to be capable of being used with either my MacBook Pro or my Windows 7 notebook. This small hub has met all of those needs without any problems.The older USB 2.0 hub that I had purchased as part of aTargus Wired Laser Pack Notebook Bundlein 2008 works just fine, but the LED had been intermittent. Had been thinking of getting another portable USB hub, so this new one will serve the purpose quite well and still allow me to keep the older one in the notebook case for emergency use.Must admit that the Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging is a plus point, as I'm tired of messing with opening clamshell packaging. It's recyclable, but is can also be repurposed; right now it's holding a bunch of rubber bands that were cluttering my workspace.If you need extra USB expansion, theAmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hubis hard to beat.8/13/2012

I've been ready to upgrade for a while and thought to get the T3i, but decided to hold out for this update. I was getting a little frustrated by the limitations of my outdated model, specifically the high noise and low ISO range. The new Digic 5 chip in the T4i is incredible. I am blown away at how better and more accurate this camera is at focusing, metering, and the insanely improved noise reduction. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to upgrade, but not ready to make the $2K+ plunge into the 5D realm.I've been using this for a few weeks and here's my take so far:-Much welcomed high ISO range with very good noise control.-The battery life is much improved. I'm kind of shocked, actually. I've taken 2000+ pictures, a few with flash, and several (usually battery-killing) long (10-300 sec) exposures, still on all three bars.-The night scene modes and noise reduction modes are GREAT.-The HDR mode is cool but I've notice the camera isn't as good as software (such as Photomatix) at blending the pictuers, specifically when it comes to ghosting and mainting edge-contrast integrity. This mode is also limited on customizeability of the toning/fusion process as compared to HDR software.-The touch screen and swivel movement are incredible. You can take shots that were otherwise impossible to get, such as the camera being above your head or low to the ground. Focusing on any point with touch is also great.-The video quality is superb, but I'm not really in the video shooting business. It's just fun to have.-I only bought the body, and would recommend this to anyone who can afford to not have the kit lense, despite it's conveneint wide focal range.

I had been quite happy with the Keyspan product. I have the HS-19 and USA=49WG four port models.  They worked great until I updated to Win7 64 Bit.  They worked great under Win7/32.  Suddenly, I was chasing BSOD (Blue Screen of Death).  After finding that the Keyspan drivers were the culprit, I went to get new drivers.  Keyspan has been acquired by Tripp Lite. They list the drivers as supporting Win7/64 - but they don't.. The driver date is 2007 - well before Windows 7.  So.. time to change.I heard that FTDI had great support.  I really wanted a four port device, with female receptacles.  This two-port cabled device was as close as I could get.  So I do have a bit more of a cable mess than with Keyspan 49, the BSOD is gone.The software is intuitive and integrated into Win7.  I have two of these devices (4 ports total).  They have serial numbers built in.  So, when I move them around to different USB ports, they always come up with the same COM number.  Not all drivers do this. Some report a different com port when plugged into a different USB port.  It is much nicer to be able to label each of the connectors as COMxx instead of having to go to device manager each time I power up.I am using 115,200 bps, but plan to move to faster speeds as I qualify my embedded device.

I'd long wished for this baby, and I couldn't be happier with it. It is beautiful and tough--seriously, when I'd played with my friends' first-gen Nanos I was terrified I was going to snap it in half. This iPod doesn't feel like a toy; its heavy enough to feel good and strong. Still, I keep it in a wallet because I'm paranoid like that.PROS:~4 GB is plenty of space for most people. I have 806 MB left over after putting most of my music library and 35 pictures on it. It is honestly PLENTY of space.~Love the color choices. The choice of black or white in the first nano was a big dealbreaker for me.~Pictures look great, you can have tons on there, you don't have to format them to put them on, just choose an iPhoto album or the whole dang library.~Music plays beautifully, all the time. Expect nothing less of Apple.~Album art showing up is a fun touch.~Its in Color, which makes a huge difference. The screen is more lovely than any iPod i've ever seen, and better than any PDA too, for that matter.~Lots of good options, like search, settings, extras, photos, music, etc.~Plenty of icons to let you know which settings you have on.~Sleep timer! For an insomniac like me, I have to have music to go to sleep. Its great that I can set it to 30 minutes, put it on my Sleepy playlist, and I'm out, plus it'll automatically turn off after 30 minutes so that you don't have to worry about battery or get woken up by a sudden screamo song.~Comes with good earphones.~Tons of other pros. It is way cooler than I ever imagined.CONS:~You can't use the nano to delete songs. You have to upload it on to the computer and then delete the songs.~It doesn't come with any exterior speakers, a dock, a user's manual, or an outlet charger. The only things in the box are the nano, headphones, a cord to connect it to the computer (which charges it and lets you put all the music on it) and a quickstart guide. You can only charge it using the computer and can only listen to it using the computer's speakers when it is plugged into the computer.Overall, it is a beautiful and amazing machine. I would buy them for everyone I know. The perfect adorable little music device. Apple's done it again. I would recommend it to anyone who loves music.UPDATE (01/07) Its been almost a month now, and the thing is WAYY cooler than you could possibly imagine. Yeah, there's no manual, but it is easy to figure out if you play with it a little. It just is made with a technology you can't match anywhere else. Lots of these reviews don't understand the technology that goes into every iPod...really, its incredible. I'm like....wow.

I wanted a true PS2 mouse because I had read that USB mice with PS2 adapters sometimes do not work well. Another reason is the keyboard and mouse ports on my KVM switch are close together, too close for a USB A connector.I chose this one because of the Logitech brand vs unknown, the reviews, and because it is a true PS2 mouse. The mouse seems to be of decent quality. The buttons and wheel have a nice feel.This mouse does have one quirk though. My keyboard shelf has a wood grain veneer, which caused the mouse to freak out every few minutes (it would jump to the top left of the screen). I downloaded and installed the latest Logitech driver but that didn't help. I was beginning to think the mouse was defective. It seemed unlikely but I placed it on a mouse pad to see if that would help, and it is okay now. My mouse pad has a print design, and though the mouse has been working much better with it, it has freaked out on me a few times over the last week. My conclusion is this mouse needs a solid color surface to work correctly.

It also has a quad core CPU and 8GB of RAM...cheap RAM, but 8GB nonetheless. The power supply is only 350 watts. Keep in mind that overall it is a pretty wimpy system, particularly compared to a gaming system I recently built myself, but I mainly bought it for my kids to use for homework and to play some of their games off of.It had one open PCI-E slot, into which I dropped this card.  The card requires no power hook-up, but instead draws its power from the motherboard.  My computer recognized it right away (Vista 64-bit Home Edition) and switched over automatically from its on-board graphics to this card. (I had to restart it once for it to find it) If this does not happen for your particular machine, the instructions tell you how to re-configure the BIOS to rectify the situation.Right now I only have it hooked up to the VGA port due to the lack of a cable.  It also has a DVI port, which I will soon use, and an HDMI port.  It comes with software for drivers (it installs two if you so desire, one for graphics and one for 3-D gaming) and also a VGA to DVI converter. It also comes with low-profile mounting brackets if required.  The instructions are very straight-forward if you need them, plus they supply the web address for a support website and a number to call 24/7 should you need assistance (I've tried neither).Now that the card has been installed on my refurbished desktop, all activities on my screen are noticeably faster.  So, for the money and for what I needed, I'm very pleased.  This is one of the few relatively low-cost cards I found that had 1GB of memory and also had an HDMI port to boot.  At present my monitor only has a DVI and a VGA port for hookup, but I like having the HDMI option in case I upgrade the monitor later.  In summary, I've found this card to be a good value for what you get and I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I bought several of these, to connect to the back of the amplifier cabinet, and the PC in a cabinet that I connect to my HDTV. The main purpose was to provide more air cooling given these generate a lot of heat and the cutout at the back of the cabinets is not big enough to allow the heat to escape fast enough. Simply connected the fan to the USB port of my PC and amp respectively, and suddenly they have gone from being almost too hot to touch, to now barely warm. Excellent device and a lifesaver for my expensive equipment.

$REVIEW.: So it is not as thin as the MS Surface membrane keyboard, but the keyboard itself has a sold feel and is responsive. I found that you do have to be careful about hitting the shift key though still easier than trying to type on the screen. The unit lacks a bottom lock, so if you are used to a laptop and flip the iPad farther than 90 degrees the top will have a tendency to continue backwards.  Also the unit does not snap or lock to the base near the keyboard. All in all it is a good unit, just a little wobbly.

$REVIEW.: This PSU is awesome. Powers my overclocked FX 8350(5.2Ghz) and Radeon HD 7950(1350Mhz) with ease. This product is quiet and performs extremely well. I've always been a fan of modular PSU's and the same holds true for this product. the box came with a storage pouch for all extra cables you don't use. The only con I have with this PSU is that when you shutdown, this power supply says running for probably a minute or so after all other components have stopped running. It't not a bid deal, I just find it strange.Overall, I would recommend this product for anyone who needs a good quality, reliable RED led power supply.

$REVIEW.: I bought this portable hard drive to replace another which had started to malfunction. It works fine, however the accompanying instructions were of no value. The included software did not load initially, requiring me to download it from Toshiba's web site. Once that was done everything worked fine.

It fits perfectly and was just what I wanted - at a fraction of the cost of similar brand-name cases!  The camera fits in perfectly and the magnetic closure works very well.  It is easy to get my camera in and out of the case quickly.  FYI - there is no extra space in this camera case for spare battery/spare storage disc.  This item is perfect for holding the camera when you don't want to carry a bulky case with spare camera parts.  The material is decent and looks/feels similar to leather.  I can't tell the difference (my wallet appreciated the cost savings!).

$review_text.: I bought this and initially considered it a good deal.  It did what it was supposed to do without any fuss, which was what I wanted.  However, after about 16 months of use (accumulating photos from twenty different calendar days), the product broke while in use.  The section to which the flash mounts and that attaches to the flash bracket broke where it attaches to the bracket.  My flash unit plummeted, but was saved by the cord, which I had secured to the bracket with a twist tie and wrapped once around the bracket's top.I'll be buying a different off-camera shoe cord, and you can be certain I will again affix the cable to the bracket, just in case.

$REVIEW.: My previous GPS was a Magellan Roadmate 2000 which is quite a few years old. When it started routing me through parking lots for the shortest route, I knew it was time to replace it.I shopped around for months before going with this particular GPS. So many bad reviews have scared me from many other models. The Megellan line is a solid performer but seemed limited, even restricted. I was ready for something new. This one fits the bill.The first thing you notice is the physical aspects: it's small even though the screen is a good size. The mount is compact. Much smaller that the Magellan. I can put the entire GPS and all associated equipment in a small camera bag. Very nice. There is a metal frame around the GPS unit itself. It is loosely mounted and I can see it falling off if it were ever dropped. The power cord is plenty long if you need to mount it far from the outlet. The mount works very well even though it is small. I had cleaned the windshield recently with a special cleaner making it very slick and the Magellan mount had a hard time holding on but the Garmin stuck right to it. The power plugs into the rear instead of the side which seems odd. The only thing is you just have to plug in the power before mounting the GPS to the holder. The screen is the right size. Not too small, not too big.On-line:This unit, like other Garmin GPS', have additional things on-line that you can download for your unit. I really like this because it will allow you to keep your unit 'fresh.' You can download different vehicles to represent your car on the map. And you can add other voices if you get tired of the included ones. The ones on-line are all incredibly annoying, but you still have a choice. You can even download a program to use your own voice, free of charge. There are even games for your GPS if you want. All very nice options, even if I'm not planning on using them. Of course being able to update the map 4 times a year is super.Actual use:I found it odd with the way the program is laid out for adding destinations. If you have more than one to enter, you have to back out and go through the menus again. Considering that I only added multiple locations for my initial setup and don't expect I'll be doing that again, it's not a big deal.It takes some time for the unit to first lock onto the satellites. Calculating routes actually takes longer than my old Magellan. It gives you a countdown as it is working out the route. The screen scrolls smoothly as you move through the map. The screen gives you plenty of information including your current speed and it updates quickly. If you wander off the route, it tells you that it's recalculating and doesn't blank the screen like the Magellan did. Re-routing is quick. The one feature that I really like is the voice. It does a good job of pronouncing street names. It speaks quickly and naturally most of the time. And it's informative, not stingy with the speaking. The speech does get a tad choppy but not distracting. I would like to see it give me directions a bit sooner when reaching a turn. It waits until I am just about at the turn, which is not good when you're on the highway. ETA estimates need some work. You have an on-screen ETA (which I really like) but it seems to think that I must be a speed demon and never stop at traffic lights. Even when driving 5-10 MPH over the limit for a long trip, the ETA estimated that I would have arrived 10 minutes earlier for my 100 minute trip. But the return trip was accurate and I was driving closer to the speed limit. Go figure.The route calculated gives somewhat different results from the Magellan. It did a good job of giving me routes that avoided slow areas and traffic lights. The old Magellan would always come up with a return route that differed from the route to the destination. The Garmin doesn't do that. I've noticed that side street names will sometimes flip around and flail around the screen if you are on a winding road or the side street is at an odd angle. It can be distracting. It shows my own house at the opposite end of the street, so there are some inaccuracies in the map as well.Overall:I really like this GPS. It has a few things about it that come off as quirky, but it works well and I enjoy using it. There's nothing so bad about it that makes this unit difficult or even unusable. and it is user friendly. You have to invest a little time to get to know how it's organized if you've not had a Garmin before. I consider this a good buy and the price isn't bad for what you're getting. I expect I'll be enjoying this one for many years to come.

Without a snug fit, the charger frequently will vibrate or work its way out and then, before you know it, your phone is nearly dead because it hadn't been charging.Definitely would NOT purchase this over others as even as cheap as it is I found it to be a waste of money.

Interestingly, I already had a 500MB 7200 RPM drive in there, so this is a 'real' test of the flash caching hardware. Honestly, those that saw a boost going from a 5400 RPM drive would have seen that regardless of the hybrid factor, just because this is a 7200 RPM.For loading the apps I run all the time, including the OS and my favorite IDEs and editors, it's noticeably faster. It isn't 'instant on' like some pure SSD setups approach, but it definitely loads faster than a regular 7200 RPM. This did take a while to start seeing, probably due to the algorithm that decides what gets cached. I've also run a custom Win 7 setup with Intel Smart Response- a pretty similar technology though that one works on the motherboard level vs. the drive here. The relative jump in performance is a bit smaller with the Momentus XT, but then again it was a lot cheaper too.That is the big selling point of this technology- it's way way cheaper than buying a big SSD and just running off that. The performance isn't up to the same level, especially if you run programs or access data that you haven't run regularly. But it's still a notch higher than a standard hard drive when it comes to things you use frequently (which is what most of us do in daily work). Also, if the flash fails for whatever reason the drive still works, and these plain old rotating platter hard disks are proven to be reliable.Been a few months now, and it's still running fine. The drive itself is very quiet and actually runs cooler than my previous one- another plus. I haven't noticed any decrease in battery life with this drive.Pros:Good performance boostInexpensive compared to full SSDsProven tech for longevityQuiet, runs coolCons:Doesn't help much for data/programs you don't use regularly

$review_text.: I've been using my Livescribe pen for just over a week now. I love it, and am not sure how I ever worked without it.In the past, after I taped an interview I would be transcribing it for hours -- even though I knew most of the interview would be background. Usually only a few precise quotes are used. But it was always impossible to find those exact quotes w/o going through the entire tape. Sigh.This past week, I've taken notes as usual (the paper is totally cool) and marked where the best quotes were so that I'd see them once I connected the pen to my desktop or laptop. I'd go directly to that spot and then I transcribe those quotes exactly. I can just flesh out the rest of the notes for background.I also like how I can put the software on multiple computers, and the pen's rendering of the pages are great.The downside I've seen to date is that I can't hook this up to a phone to use it for a phone interview. I'd need to use speaker phone so the pen could "hear," and I hate using a speaker phone for an interview. For those, I have to record the old-fashioned way -- hooking up my digital recorder to the phone. Oh, well. Hopefully the company will solve that problem some day.If you are a reporter, you want this pen. Really.

$REVIEW.: Why would you hookup an ipod to a receiver that you have to get up to alter when you can hook this up. It is nice being able to hook this up to the internet and not having to hook the others up to a lan cord.  Setup was very simple.  The app is great.

$review_text.: The good: They are comfortable and produce okay soundThe bad: they produce "okay" sound and are too comfortable, they do not hug my ears tight enough and are a bit too sloppy.Review:The sound is okay, not as good as my Koss Portapro but then those are 5x the price.there is a problem with the balance and these tend to put out 20%-50% more sound into the left channel. I suspect the volume control wheel to be the fault, I can turn these down and gradually increase volume to find when the left channel gets it's boost. It's really irritating and makes the sound experience lop-sided, I have flipped them around to be sure that I'm not just going deaf in my right ear, and the problem persists only opposite so it is not just my ears.It's not bad for general listening or watching movies, but I'm surprised they could put "Professional" on a set of headphones with such a flaw. I would argue that these are not good for studio use, not just because of the balance flaw but also because they are very loose and do not hug my ears tightly enough. If you're really tight on cash and know a bit about re-wiring headphones you could cut the volume wheel out and wire it in straight, assuming it is indeed the wheel that is to blame for the imbalance. My sound card does not support the "Balance" feature or that would work just as well.In conclusion:Buy these if you just need a simple pair of phones with decent but not perfect sound. You do get what you pay for most of the time, these are really good for their price but they do have the balance flaw issue.Now, I can't stand when I read a review that says they didn't like the product, or that the product wasn't that great but they do not provide any suggestions for something better, so I would suggest a pair of Sony MDR-V6 for quality/value/cost. Sony MDR-V6 are going to be my next serious choice in headphones if not the Ultrasone hfi-780's. I would love to go for Denon, but can't see myself paying that sort of price for headphones.

I can hear a slight buzz if I get within about 2 feet of it and listen carefully.

$review_text.: This is a very versatile unit that can be used as a TV or a monitor for your computer.  The picture is clear and sharp.  However, the sound is AWFUL tinny and puny.  I purchased a set of inexpensive computer speakers and plugged them into the back, and that made all the difference in the world. The unit set up very easily with my satellite dish and the controls are easy.  I had this TV in the kitchen of my old house; I couldn't use it when I moved, so my grand-niece has it now and is thrilled by it.

The first one I had for five years and the screen finally gave away to my touch. So I bought this one after much research. The sound quality is great and I really enjoy the side bar. The speed limit is sometimes not correct. I think this is due to the fact when there is a speed revision and I haven't received the update yet. This has happened in VA. We just had a speed increase about two months ago and the Garmin is reading five under. But I feel this will change when I receive the updates. I also like the other features is shows on the sidebars and looking for Entertainment, Gas Stations, etc. has been very exact. You should invest in this product if you need a GPS. You will NOT be dissatisfied.

$REVIEW.: ***Update April 25, 2010***New firmware (same one) is working now
 Wireless is good

 Update procedure is buggy and it seems new firmware did not fully kick in for several days, despite what diagnostics said

 Now it is working similarly to when I first got the radio (which is still buggy, but at least it plays music)

 Raising to a cautious 3 stars.***End Update***Running the latest firmware as shown above
 Wireless is now BROKEN beyond belief
 Will only work properly with ethernet

 This is kind of a big deal
 Wireless issues include:- Impossible to join network most of the time (even though it worked fine in the past).- Loses connections too easily, even strong signals.- Music stops mere seconds after starting, then FREEZES.- Menu options disappear from time to time, making it hard to choose stuff


 Duh.- Forgets wireless settings and even its own NAME
 Re-typing such text with the wheel is slow torture on this device.- Absolutely unreliable in general, so don't risk using it as an alarm clock.- Rebooting/resetting/reinstalling firmware improves nothing.As an IT pro, I troubleshoot network devices all the time


 The last thing I need is to come home to this crap
 Such a shame, because the product worked quite well until the last couple of firmware updates

 A few tolerable bugs existed before, but nothing like this


 I don't understand how others using the same firmware are suddenly having all their prayers answered
 My experience is quite the opposite.Other general complaints:- "Diagnostics" do not actually diagnose anything

 Just tells you current settings.- Startup/shutdown chime is completely inappropriate in a product aimed for the bedside radio market


 Loud/obnoxious


 Bad design decision.- Device sometimes gets confused about whether things are connected via line-out, etc.- Look and feel of the text wheel needs work

 Poor visual feedback when spinning/pressing to enter text


 Always seems like I'm spinning the wheel in the wrong direction, for example.- No weather app?  Actually no new apps at all to my knowledge since the debut of the device

 Sad.- No battery or remote yet

 VERY expensive pricetag for accessories that don't exist.I cannot recommend this product at this time

 Seriously looking at a Sony Dash or just re-purposing an old laptop.

One thing thats a plus about this player is that it only takes "ONE" battery, not TWO! So you can save batteries

For 49.99, thats a cheap price for a really good discman! Worth the money!

Everything has been placed on this drive, and there is still room to spare.  The unit itself is smaller than a good pair of PC loudspeakers - the unit is really small.  It goes into power save mode automatically with your PC when it sleeps - BTW there is no power button on the drive), and it boots up along with your PC when powered on.  While I do wish the drive did have a power switch, I really can't say that I miss it.  The drive is exceptionally quiet, and I have to check the power light to make sure it is in operation.  The price for this unit is almost unbelievable, and makes it a smart decision for anyone looking to archive files and information.  I plan to purchase another one shortly.

They do trap some heat, just because they cup your ears, but if you need more airflow you can adjust them a little larger than you need, and they do not pinch so tightly as to give you a headache. My ears (which are rather large) also fit fairly well inside them and are not in any way pinched or hampered. Comfort wise, these are definitely top notch for this style of headset. As another reviewer pointed out the mic does not stick out in front of your mouth, but this is intentional (and quite common nowadays), and in no way affects sound quality.To the sound:Voice quality is great. I wouldn't use it for studio recording, but for the voice chat and phone call market it seems intended for, it's great. It doesn't seem to cancel out background noise, but it does not advertise this feature, and unless you have a lot going on in the background, it should be inaudible to your teammates. As for incoming sound, it's a little above average for a standard stereo headset, which is to say it isn't as good as speakers, but everything is crisp and clear. It seems to have good bass response, and actually has a little more trouble with higher range notes (I first noticed this with  Symphonic Classical music's cymbal crashes, and didn't ever notice it in the Classic Rock I play while gaming, or in game or voice sounds themselves). If you want superb, game-changing sound, go for the surround sound version of this headset.Overall:I can't think of much bad to say about the headset. It's exactly what it purports itself to be, which is a comfortable gaming/voice chatting headset with standard stereo sound. Plantronics hit a home run with this one in my book, and in my experience, they always do. I should add that I haven't had the headset long yet, but as it was a self-chosen birthday gift, I spent most of the day testing it. ;)UPDATE 1/29/2011: I originally purchased this item in Spring/Summer of 2010. A year has nearly passed, and I thought I should update the review with a longer-term opinion. That is what follows:After a year of use for voice chat, video calls, and video gaming, I can't say I've found anything seriously wrong with this headset. I frequently wish the cord was just a little longer, or that it was wireless, as I use it with my desktop and it has to travel a significant distance behind the desk to get to my head. It is always comfortable, and only gets over-warm if the room I'm in is already fairly warm (Above 80 degrees Farenheit or so and I wouldn't wear it for prolonged periods). While I'd like an upgrade with simulated surround sound at some point, this headset still deserves five stars. It delivers great performance at a great price.

$REVIEW.: Okay I ordered this mouse because I love having the most up to date devices I can afford and get my hands to, besides having another reliable Logitech mouse already at home, when I read the description of this mouse I was blown away with curiosity and I had to see for myself.The DarkField technology implemented in this mouse really works as stated in the product description.The installation was a breeze as well, no need to install the software CD with it if you choose not to. (although it is recommended if you need to customize the buttons which by default already come pre-set therefore no need to install the aforementioned CD.)As soon as I plugged in the receiver into my computer and other computers I have at home, all the computer recognized the device within a matter of 10-15 seconds and soon I was on my way scrolling and literally flying through pages with this mouse. (I still didn't install the CD software mind you.)In conclusion if all you want is a good reliable mouse that will practically work in any surface and you don't have time or patience to deal with installing CDs and all you want is to plug and forget, get this mouse because it's medium sized (perfect for most individuals) and it can go perfect with laptops too since the size of it it's between a laptop mouse and a desktop mouse and it's light, comfortable and simply works great.I highly recommend this.~VT~

$REVIEW.: The ID function worked but the delete button never worked, even if held down for 10 seconds. The redial function was S-T-R-A-N-G-E... I never knew exactly what it would dial or the number of digits for that matter. In retrospect it was worth exactly what I paid for it, no more. I would not call it a good value for the money, either. It is simply an early, dumb ID box.  After several months it found its way to our community recycling center. IMHO it was just a strange, idiosyncratic, little device. But it does look impressive, though.

$review_text.: I've owned three of this company's large-print keyboards, because they work great for about a year until the keys seem to catch on the mechanics underneath and they break down


I am throwing away the third and last one and buying up in quality, I hope

It's an inexpensive solution but not recommended by me for heavy use.

$review_text.: I bought this projector for use in an outdoor home theatre installation and was more than pleased with not only the light output, but also the quality of the picture (paired with a blu-ray source). I expected a greater loss of fidelity in exchange for the additional lumens but that wasn't the case. The lens shift feature alone is well worth the price of entry. This projector won a best in class runner up in Projector Review's annual awards in 2010. Prices are down significantly from when I purchased so the value proposition is even greater. Recommended.

$review_text.: I usually love TwelveSouth items, but this one is merely meh. Reality is I probably should have sent it back. It's not really that there is anything wrong with it, rather it's just not as functional as I was kind of picturing it to be. Also, lining up the phone for charging is kind of a pain, especially when your phone is in a case.Also, it requires you to use your apple lightning cable, so buy an extra for traveling.

I am appalled at the almost total lack of directions for the unit


The very small booklet purporting to tell you how to use it is a joke


It never mentions for example, how to turn it off


After four hours of playing around with it alone and hooked up to my computer, I finally got the firmware updated and also the maps

But, that was no thanks to Garmin---only because I have some knowledge of computers

I tried to call customer support when the unit locked up while installing the firware update, but the wait time was an hour

This is a joke
Whomever wrote the instruction book assumed the user knows all about these things and how to hook them up, etc


Wrong!! All in all, the unit seems to be of value and use to me in traveling, but I suggest anyone buying a GPS for the first time should talk to someone who has one already and get some tips and the name of another company who makes these things
I would NOT recommend Garmin, no matter how good their GPS units are, based on their level of customer (non)support and user instructions.Also, I cannot recommend any Garmin GPS due to their high charge for map updates

$REVIEW.: I bought my G6 in December, borrowed a Canon 420 EX speedlite and liked the results but I wondered if the smaller, lighter, less expensive 220 EX would be good enough?  Some of the reviews here say it is underpowered.  Is it?  I bought one to find out and took both out into my backyard in 8 PM darkness to try them at 5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet and 40 feet on the G6.Conclusion #1:  The G6 has a good builtin flash.  It makes good images within it's limited range of 5 meters/16 feet (or 4 meters/13 feet when the lens is set to telephoto) and works well as a fill flash.  Complete failure beyond 20 feet.Conclusion #2:  The 420EX (range 24.2 meters) and the 220EX (range 15.7 meters/51.5 feet) both make better images than the builtin flash and both offer longer range.  But both are limited by the autofocus range of 5 to 7 meters.  That's right, neither flash can focus on a subject more than 20 feet away in darkness with the lens set to telephoto.  Both worked fine when the lens was set to wide angle at 40 feet.Final Conclusion:  I'm keeping the 220 EX.  The G6 is small and light, so is the 220EX.  They make a good team, but the G6 also does well alone up close.

$REVIEW.: This product worked just as described
Was easy to hook up, and the cost is quite reasonable

My only complaint is that you need to be careful when dealing with the wires for that connect the emitters to your components


If you snag a wire accidentally after attaching an emitter, the emitter will pull off the end of the wire rather easily, and you can't reattach

I had to order another set of emitters after doing that to one, but it was reasonably priced and the new one worked fine

Just exercise some care when hooking this unit up.

$review_text.: I purchased these speakers because I go to a handful of football games where I tailgate with friends and I was looking for a small portable speaker that I could transmit FM radio to from my phone - that means it was key that these can be operated by battery.I've been pleased with these so far


 I haven't put batteries in yet, but in my at-home testing I've been pleased
 Ease of use is great


 Pairing it with my phone was very simple...with the unit turned off just hold down 1 button for a few seconds and it enters pairing mode

 From there I searched for it on my phone and voila, within seconds I was streaming music from my phone
 I also used an audio cable (male to male) going from my MP3 player to these speakers using the "In" jack, and the result was just as good.As for sound quality, these speakers won't blow you away

I had the same experience. I followed the instructions, used the cloth to clean and the rubber finger pads (included). My Garmin 800 is brand new, so no previous oil or residues were present. I applied the screen from the center on outwards and no bubbles or reapplication was necessary. As suggested by the intructions, I used a credit card to gently push product seal from center outward. Could not for the life of me get a perfect invisible seal on all the edges. Bottom line: Most of the screen protector covers the screen, it does essentially what it is designed for, but does not create a 100% clear seal on the edges and is just "OK".

$review_text.: Actually, this is the only digital radio I even own, and I don't think I'll need another one


 This tuner is super sweet


 However, it is a TUNER, and does not come with any internal speakers

 You will need to supply your own.It connects fast to my wireless network, and can even be plugged in via ethernet


 I had no problems connecting ever, and havent had any buffering problems, yet.You get a ton of stations along with Pandora, and Sirius XM (subscription needed)


 You can also stream music from your computer, and via USB stick

 The display is basic, and the knob acts as a controller


 You select stations and options with it, and push the knob in to enter


There is a controller included, and I suggest using that to program stuff
 If you have an iPhone, download the Grace app for free and use that to save preset stations

 It is a lot easier using the iPhone to pick your stations
 The iPhone app will shut off the tuner, but will not turn it on.I currently have this connected to a Denon Soundbar, and the sound quality is excellent


 I give this a 5 star rating, and see no fault with the design or use based on it's price and features.I highly recommend this!

The other two pins which should hold the Silverstone were way off.

$review_text.: It seems to be getting really difficult to buy a decent keyboard

 I bought two of these based on the reviews here
 I wanted something that was quiet to type on, and the volume controls were a plus
 But after using it for several months I don't find it to be all that quiet

 And the stylish rounding over of the front edge, along with all the front keys (space bar, arrows, etc.) is quite aggravating in actual use.I find the arrow keys on this keyboard to be the most annoying


 Along with the left, right, and down keys being so rounded over they are difficult to use, the up arrow is rounded in the opposite direction


 So when you try to use these keys, the rounded section actually dips below the top!  The function keys are really small and hard to press too

 Add to this the black motif, and you end up with a keyboard that is very difficult to use in low light conditions and almost impossible to use in games.I replaced this with a Targus AKB04US, which costs a little more but is quite a bit better.

$REVIEW.: I've been burned by online battery orders in the past.  But 4 people had already rated this battery as positive, so thought I'd give it a try.  Battery in my Dell laptop had deteriorated to the point where it had one hour of life, but there was a message to replace the battery.  So I tried this one.I did the setup recommended by the booklet supplied, and after 3 cycles up and down, it measured 4 1/2 hours of life -- with full monitor brightness and not shutting off.  So I can expect much more when I dim down the monitor and turn it off when inactive.This seems to be a great battery, even better than the one supplied when the laptop was new.

 At first I got a Sony LCD (42XBR6)


 The picture was generally very good, but I noticed a persistent "green tinge" in certain scenes, usually in dark areas

 I learned this is called "creeping moss" or dynamic false contouring
I tried having the set repaired, and even got a refurbished replacement from Sony
 I was still having problems, and thought maybe it's me and not the TV

However, I decided to try the Panasonic plasma based on reviews at CNET.From the very beginning, the Panasonic TC-42G10 plasma has been great

 The picture is beautiful

 I kept the picture setting on standard, and adjusted the controls to below 50, for the first 100 hours, for break-in


 Frankly, I liked the picture so much, I now use the standard setting for most viewing
 I use the THX setting for movies (HBO, Starz, DVDs, etc)

Colors are incredible and the black levels are stunning


 I also have a small Samsung LCD TV

 While the Samsung picture is very nice, it really doesn't touch the Panasonic (although, to be fair, the Samsung is a 720p 26" screen).I like to watch things in full screen, even standard definition broadcasts


 With the various format settings (full, Just, zoom), you can fill up the screen without much distortion.The Sony had tons of settings
 I scoured message boards and websites looking for the combination that would give me that perfect picture


 You have far less options with the Panasonic, but I don't really need them

 I marvel at the quality of the picture and am glad I made the switch (a friend took my Sony, and he seems pretty happy with it).

No need to carry a 3lb laptop... charger...etc.  I keep the Bluetooth keyboard at home....  and at the office I use a full size BT keyboard.Performance---  battery life is amazing.  My biggest question mark was.. how will this processor work for my daily tasks.  My typical normally use for work is--- excel, outlook, onenote, word, pdf and the web.  I don't use photoshop or any other heavy programs that would require extra processing power.  Overall  the programs and apps are working great.  Some programs are super fast... and some programs seem to be slower--- but in no way does it my overall ability to do work.  Sure  Baytrail or even Surface 3 (icore chips) will be much faster...  but wasn't interested in dropping </review_text><review_summary>it good for device</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A32E7OZA09LXN"><latest_review_date>14/01/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0093HGD2K</product_id><review_date>14/01/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>The perfect stand for my iPad</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A32EMUXA6WMTJP"><latest_review_date>03/05/2004</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B001FVI91U</product_id><review_date>03/05/2004</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Love my new HDTV</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A32G080OI8O113"><latest_review_date>16/09/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0052YO762</product_id><review_date>16/09/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Very small, clear audio, but not forever</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A32G7NJHPD3I56"><latest_review_date>03/03/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B000165AOY</product_id><review_date>03/03/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Great replacement!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A32IG4MF6UFC2I"><latest_review_date>26/03/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0087U4V3W</product_id><review_date>26/03/2014</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>there is nothing wrong with this DVD burner it works as advertised burns reads  as well as any other brand

AT&amp;T; had given me a website to register the new modem at so it was really convenient.  Also, the new modem has somehow increased my upload and download speeds over my AT&amp;T; supplied modem.The only problem was the ad says you can use this modem via USB with an optional adapter. ... I don't really care cause I am using the Ethernet connection anyway.  Just a note. :)

This device can't even play MP3s or JPG photo-discs.  Are you KIDDING?!+ Awkward remote control button placement with no back-lighted buttons.+ Stupid audio CD playback where you can't even use the numbers on the remote to select which track you want.Okay folks, if all you want is a great Blu-Ray player that can handle multiple older formats of discs, you probably want to go with the Panasonic series given editors choice award on CNet.  However, if you love Netflix like I do, then this seemed/seems like a great option.  Sadly, it seems Samsung has cut a lot of corners in the non-Blu-Ray department to get this model out.The Blu-Ray picture is excellent in the Samsung, but they stumble greatly in giving us features we are accustom too.  It is really odd to see a product excel in one area and be so sub-par in another.  This frustrates me greatly because now I have to keep my old DVD player around to play photo CDs, MP3s, and finally DVD-Rs that my computer can burn.  Samsung never promised to support these formats, but they really should in this day and age.  My only hope is that Samsung will offer a firmware update that will address my complaints but there is nothing on the radar indicating that they'll do this.  Otherwise I will have to buy a new Blu-Ray player in about 1-2 years, and this is partially why I dropped the rating down to 3 stars.The player does a very good job at playing/upconverting DVDs.  I had to turn off the auto-DVD correction however as it was making the picture worse in my opinion.  CNet claims that the Oppo player is only a hair better than Samsung in this department, but no one notices a hair's difference in audio/video.  In other words, the Oppo is really 10-15% better in up converting DVDs in my personal comparison.I also recommend turning down/off the sharpness otherwise you'll find bad transfer/compression artifacts magnified.  This was very evident in Black Hawk Down (Blu-Ray version) where mosquito noise in the sky shots were more visible with the sharpness on high.  Although people rave about Black Hawk Down, it was done in MPEG-2 which I think may lead to skeeter noise, and no fault of Samsung.  I still need to test this player with movies that is using better encoders besides animated movies like Kung Fu Panda and Cars, which were amazingly clear on this player.Finally, a little tip for those doing USB firmware updates... (1) make sure you download the USB update instead of the CD update per the instructions on Samsung's site, (2) unzip the file and place it at the root of the USB drive, and (3) plug in the USB drive after you booted up to the main screen instead of having the drive plugged in before powering on.  That's when it finally worked for me.

$review_text.: EDIT #3: Back to a great review :)  While complaining on twitter about my projector, @OptomaUSA saw it and contacted me about fixing my projector
 Long story short, they fixed it at no cost to me, other than shipping it to them

 This was a great gesture considering the warranty had been out for 6 months

 I hope to get more than a year out of the replacement chip.EDIT #2: To be exact, I have 475 hours on this projector.EDIT:  Well, with just a little over a year on this projector and still the original bulb, I have in excess of 50 dead pixels on my screen

 Even at $500 for this projector, it's not worth it if it only lasts a year.PREVIOUS REVIEW:I bought this projector after my Dell 2300MP died an inexplicable death

$review_text.: This lens is amazing!  I just recently bought the Pentax K10D, my first dSLR, because I wanted to take better pictures indoors.  I purchased the camera without the kit lens and bought the FA 50mm f/1.4 instead.  The difference between my new camera/lens and my "Advanced Compact Super-zoom" (Canon S2 IS) is night and day.  I used to take hundreds of shots in continuous mode to get a few sharp ones -- which were still rather noisy.  With this lens I get sharp pictures indoors without using a flash.This is a great lens for head shots indoors.  It is a moderate telephoto on a dSLR (due to the smaller sensor), so it is sometimes difficult/impossible to move back enough to get a full body shot in a smaller room.  Depending on your needs you may prefer the "normal" view that the 35mm f/2 would provide -- but that lens costs about 50% more.I am loving this lens.  I find myself using it at about f/2.8 most of the time, thus far (to keep the subject's entire head in focus).

$REVIEW.: You can read all the "specs" doing a Google search so I won't bore you with the geek-tails. The simple answer is that this lens does as promised. It is a very nice, fast lens, for a reasonable price. If you are in a "No Flash Photography" zone, then this lens will get the job done, providing you can take a few steps back from your subject. I took it out for it's 1st "test drive" last night at the local bowling alley. The shots were taken at night with 100% ambient artificial lighting and with the D200 cranked up to ISO 1600 had no problem pulling in 1/125 to 1/180 Sec. shutter speeds with the Aperture notched down a couple of clicks from wide open. While I have definitely not put it through all the paces as of yet, I do have a couple of notations:- I like the fact that the lens hood completely covers the focusing ring when reveresed (as in indoor use), yet leaves the zoom ring completely wide open. This makes for very comfortable usage being able to use the full length to steady the camera and having unfettered access to the zoom ring.- Focus is quick &amp; silent, and I haven't yet experienced any auto-focus "hunting" problems.- Shots so far appear very acceptable. Please note that although I appreciate amazon's customer photo "samples", they manage to compress &amp; reduce them so much that they lose a great deal of clarity. The images I've taken are much better than the few uploaded here. Bottom line, this lens takes quite nice photos.- Look &amp; feel is professional &amp; solid, with smooth as silk zoom &amp; focus action. This lens does not "telecope" in and out as do many zooms. It's length remains constant from 50 to 150mm.- The one and only thing I do not like about this lens (and my other Sigma lenses) is that you cannot remove/install the lens cap when the lens hood is installed for outdoor glare protection. Nikon &amp; Tamron lenses have a center pinch design that allows for easy installation/removal of the caps without removing the lens hood. I wish Sigma would do this as well. Some say you do not need a lens cap on when the hood is installed, but they obviously do not live in a dusty (desert) area. I almost knocked it down to four stars for that, but I'm simply too forgiving...

$REVIEW.: This case seems kind of expensive for a Kindle and I hesitated ordering it, but I'm glad it did. It protects it well, looks good, and it's comfortable in your hands. And I discovered accidentally that it provides some weather protection for your Kindle -- I accidentally left my Kindle out on my deck when evening and it rained that night. When I discovered this the next morning, I was fully prepared for a dead Kindle, but after wiping the water off the case, the Kindle powered right up and I'm still using it every day months later. I'm sure it wouldn't protect the Kindle in a hard downpour, but I was surprised that it did keep the device dry in a moderate shower.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this armband for a few weeks now. It is definitely NOT too big like some others have said. I'm a small woman and its plenty small enough for me to get a snug fit. Its very comfortable to wear, the neoprene really helps as does the stretchy material. The only improvements I would suggest are a bigger piece of hook velcro, I think its too small and will wear out eventually (but could also be replaced), and some means of stowing the excess cord from my ear buds.

</review_text><review_summary>PROS:-price, is very reasonable for a tablet which is also a computer-fully functional online features (e-mail, web-browsing, office applications suite, etc.)-good battery life-fast boot times (SSD for local storage and OS)-free appsNEUTRAL:-you get 100GB of space on Google Drive (BUT, it is only free for 2 years once activated)-has 2 USB ports-has 1 headphone port-has 1 laptop lock port-has 1 HDMI-OUT port-has 1 SD-card reader port-Does not run Android apps (ONLY Chrome apps)CONS:-pretty much online-only-file transfers and OS in general are pretty clunky/old-school-the keyboard is non-standard and takes a lot to get used to, and it is missing several keys I consider to be critical-my unit arrived bowed (may just be my unit, though)======================================================================================That is about all of the good stuff I can name. So, on to the bad stuff.You should know up front, this device is meant to be an online-only device. It is not meant to be used offline, and in fact for the most part it WILL NOT work when offline. You need to plan ahead if you need to use it offline, and download your files to the local drive, etc. Speaking of files, the operating system looks sort of like Windows/Mac-OS, but doesn't really work like them. File transfers is a perfect example, transferring files involves lots of extra steps that feel clunky and very Linux-like. To get files off a USB drive, once the drive has been plugged in and recognized, you either have to figure out how to get the context menu up with the touchpad, or drag and drop files to where you want them to go. And there are no windows in the operating system. Just one window will appear, with a sidebar listing available locations on the drive. It all feels very old-school, and not intuitive at all, especially for anyone who has never used a computer prior to Windows XP/Mac-OSX. To this day I do not know where to look to find out how much space I have available in local storage.The device comes with 100GB of free* space in the Google Drive online storage ("cloud") space -- which helps relieve the relatively small size of the local storage drive. HOWEVER, that free* space comes with an caveat, and the caveat is that the space is only free for 2 years once activated on the main Google account for the device. That is kind of outrageous. A certain portion of extra online storage space should have been made available free to owners of a Google chromebook for the lifetime of the device. What they are doing is akin to TIVO trying to sell a DVR with only 5GB of local storage, and then trying to rent users of that computer storage space online ("in the cloud") for the life of the device to make up for the very small local storage, minus an introductory period. I cannot imagine anyone putting up with that from TIVO, so why from Google? If this device is intended to be a main computer for anyone, then that 2 year expiration is going to be always looming on the horizon, waiting to ruin everything.The keyboard takes a LOT of getting used to. It is MUCH smaller than a standard or even small-scale laptop keyboard. Additionally, keys I consider to be vital, are missing (like the delete key, the home key, the end key, the page-up key, and the page-down key to name a few). That takes some SERIOUS adjustment for anyone who types professionally for a living (as I do). There ARE hot-keys you can learn to do some of those things, and to replace things like the Windows-Key+L to lock the screen (it is CTRL+SHIFT+L on a chromebook, you're welcome ^_- ). There are also additional keys on the device that aren't normally on regular devices, such as a reload button, forward and back buttons, and other browser controls. I pretty much never use them, because I am so trained to use the controls on the screen instead.Also, if you might think that a Google device should be able to run Android applications, you should know that a chromebook cannot. The chromebook can run applications that are available in the Chrome store, but NOT the Android/Google-Play store.Finally, I don't know if my unit was just damaged or weirdly manufactured, but it arrived bowed. There is a slight curve to the entire unit that makes me constantly want to straighten it out whenever I look at it, by grabbing both ends and flexing it the opposite way of the bow, but I am sure that would harm the device.Overall, the device is fine for what it is: a glorified web-browser with its own built-in battery and screen and keyboard. Everything you can do online (minus Flash stuff), you can do with a Chromebook. But, it cannot run Android apps, and its offline capabilities are almost non-existent, the file and operating system are clunky, printing will require you get a printer than can print from "the cloud", etc. etc. It isn't a BAD device, but it isn't a full tablet, and it isn't a full computer. It is a web-browser dressed up to look like a tablet that is also a computer. That may work fine for LOTS of people, but make sure you know what you are getting before you buy.3.5 stars (rounded down to 3, since Amazon doesn't doesn't allow partial stars)</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A350JKTQ5065XF"><latest_review_date>09/03/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B002SRQ214</product_id><review_date>09/03/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[2, 2]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Works great!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A351NLS8G79V5P"><latest_review_date>05/11/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B002SFDJMQ</product_id><review_date>05/11/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>I've learned to trust AmazonBasics</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A351ZHHORJ2L12"><latest_review_date>09/12/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B000EXS1BS</product_id><review_date>09/12/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[1, 2]</review_helpful><review_text>I read many reviews and after  ordered it, to my surprise this is a very well built tripod and will handle my D7000 my 18-200VR lens with no problem and plan on getting a 150-500 lens and I am sure this will be able to handle that one also.Has a good height and the stability is pretty solid, the only problem I have is the ball head is a little stiff for panning smoothly but I am sure once I read the instructions I will find a solution to this.

$review_text.: I bought this player because of all the good reviews and it had a built in FM radio, line in recording and it had a drag and drop feature for copying files.When I got the player I was immediately disappointed because the player though very light was made of very cheap plastic.  Also, the buttons does not seem very sturdy.The MP3 sound quality is good but the FM radio reception is very poor.  I previously had a Nomad II, which had a much better reception.The line in recording is very useful but it is of very poor quality and so it is not really worth it.  It is much better to use a computer to encode the MP3 songs.I am definitely returning mine and my hunt for another player continues.

$review_text.: Got a new LG 50" plasma, so I thought it would be best to get a LG Blu-ray player.  I was skittish due to the reviews on here, but took a chance anyway.  Set up the player and everything worked perfectly, Netflix and all.  What was wrong with all those reviewers?  Then the problems started with Netflix.  First, a simple off and on would get it back to working.  Not ideal, but I could live with that occasionally.  Then Netflix would not work no matter what, off/on, deactivate/reactivate and it could not have happened at a worst time, a planned movie night.  Amazon worked but did not have the desired movie.  Ok, everybody has a bad day, I was willing to forgive and try again on another day.  Well, that day came and another day and another day, still could not get Netflix to work.  Amazon, Pandora worked fine but not Netflix.  I don't know if it was one of those notorious firmware updates but Netflix would do everything as if working then give me the message, "We're having trouble playing this title right now.  Please try again later or select a different title."  However, it did not matter what title was selected.  Netflix worked just fine on our desktop, laptop, iPad, and Panasonic Blu-ray player in another room.  No problems with Blu-ray and DVD play.Unfortunately, I do not believe I have any choice but to send this player back.  Maybe, I will go for an exchange first but if that turns out bad I guess I will have to give up on this player.****************************4-23-12Gave it one final Netflix test this morning. No go.  Started the return process, new player on the way, old one on its way back to Amazon.  Hopefully, the new one will work out.****************************5-1-12Received replacement quickly.  Thanks Amazon.  First streaming Netflix movie went without a hitch.  Second movie was continually glitchy, though not enough of a sample size to effectively judge.  Better than the first one, but I will be holding on to the box.****************************5-15-12Replacement has gone belly up as well.  This time it would not even eject the disc, had to take it apart to get it out.  Sending back and will be getting a refund this time.  Worked well for a minute, then went into permanent "boot" only mode.  LG obviously has some serious QC issues with this product.  I'm surprised Amazon still sells it.  It has to be a PITA for them also.

$REVIEW.: This is a good value for a reliable 4GB thumb drive. It's not as sleek as I'd like (I'm a Mac guy), but I wouldn't want to pay more just for some smooth beige casing. Well, not a lot more, anyway.The slide feature is the only thing that makes this gadget different. Others use caps to make them pocket-friendly, which are obviously less convenient. The slider takes a little getting used to; just make sure you don't press it while you're plugging the thing in.

Great sound and light


Good for sitting on the couch over 10 feet away from the tv

Unfortunately the headphone cord from the base to the headphone plug is short so they have to be right near the stereo and the base with the headphones will probablty get knocked over at least once.

$review_text.: I got this motherboard for my first build and I am still surprised by its excellence. The motherboard comes with multiple pci-e slots; enabling one to provide support for graphics cards. It also features 6 sata ports that enable one to support multiple hard drives and solid state drives. I had no issues with the install of the product and didn't even had to consult tech support for product use issues. I had heard close friends rave about the quality of Asus product and I can definitely see how the company earned its reputation. The q-code display even features codes specifying how your computer is operating-this was especially useful as I was starting the system and allowed me to troubleshoot what issues were preventing my system from operating fully. Great product! Great feel! Looks excellent in my Fractal Design R4 case. A great motherboard for supporting games and 3-d rendering software. Even allows for expansion.

$review_text.: We've never used a GPS before, so I chose this mount based on Amazon reviews. It came with no instructions,,just a photo, but my husband easily assembled it and saw how the latch worked. The Garmin just clicks on and off (once I got the knack) .We're surprised that even going over bumps, this heavy little mount really does stay securely placed on the edge of the dashboard exactly where we want it--so both the driver and  the &amp;#34;navigator&amp;#34; can see the GPS.  I can't imagine trying to place it so exactly using suction cups. The mount adjusts the Garmin up and down and sideways for the perfect viewing angle and to avoid glare, Then when i'm ready, I can just pick the mount right up and store or hide it.  An accessory very much worth having.

I was able to get a complete Mac data backup immediately upon installation.No need to ho out and buy cables - the Thunderbolt comes complete with both a USB 3.0 cable and a Thunderbolt cable I was able transfer, store, and secure my blazingly fast and easily.  What I love most about this unit is that is plug and play. There are no drivers to download and is pre-formatted for Mac computers and Time Machine Backup. There is no need for a separate electric outlet connection. It is simple and perfect for all.

Really wanted the wires off the floor and wanted faster speed then wireless for Wii and streaming movies, music and You Tube to my entertainment center. The house was built in 1984 and is single story. The office where the router is and the entertainment center power are on different circuits.From opening the box to up and running took 15 minutes and 10 minutes were in moving some furniture. There was no software to install, no configuration, it was truly plug and use. This product could not have preformed better. It was a little pricey, and there are cheaper ones out there, but this was worth every penny! Many of the less expensive ones had a greater percentage of dissatisfied customers and I needed all four ports this had for TV, Sound/Blue Ray, Wii, Videoconferencing.Did not need to call Netgear about set up so I can't testify about their customer service. Also not sure of multiple floors, but it definitely crossed circuit breakers in the electrical panel. Distance from plug in office and entertainment center is 40'.

The Lumix GF6 marks my graduation to a "real camera".This camera looks great.  It is a solid piece of equipment and everything works.  The pictures it takes using the iA (AUTO) setting allowed me to start taking quality photographs without getting very far into setting up the onboard protocols.  Pictures taken this way are crisp, well colored and obviously better than any I have taken with my various pocket sized digital cameras.The zooming feature requires manipulating a ring on the lens. That is easy to do, but a bit strange to a veteran point and shoot user accustomed to a power zoom.After only a few days with the Lumix GF6 I have learned to take advantage of the extensive list of scene choices that provide two dozen built-in adjustments for various conditions.The three inch composition/viewing screen flashes helpful information regarding these settings.  They go from adjusting to nighttime conditions to fast shutter speeds for sports or fidgety kids.In the Creative Control mode the camera provides another list of effects and color adjustments for shooting dramatic pictures beyond the norm.There are almost endless choices for adjusting the look of photos taken with the camera and I have only started using them, but suffice to say--this camera has them all.The mode dial on top of the camera can be set to aperture or shutter priority.  The iA (auto) feature is activated by a lighted button also on top of the camera.  The video button is up there too.I am having a ball shooting panorama pictures with that setting on the mode dial at the top of the camera.  That feature is amazing.I was surprised to discover I can add a date stamp to pictures already shot.  There are lots of times I don't want a date splashed on the lower corner of my photographs, but sometimes that is nice to have.  The Lumix GF6 provides the ability to stamp a photo and save it as a copy so the original remains clear of a date mark.The screen is a touch type (capacitive) and it swings out and up to allow one to compose shots at greater angles.  The screen flips up to point forward just in case you want to take a picture of yourself.  I actually did that a couple of times.  Anyhow, I like the screen.There is a pop-up flash that requires pushing a little button on top of the camera.  If one forgets to pop the flash a reminder comes across the composition screen.One thing that drew me to the GF6 was the WiFi function.  I can wirelessly transfer photos from the camera to my iPad and that was a big plus in making the decision to buy this camera.  The WiFi function can be used with several individual apple iOS devices after each is setup with the camera. I suspect most cameras will have the WiFi capacity eventually, but for now there are only three or four out there.The GF6 stores pictures on SD cards.  The battery is a Lithium Ion type DMW-BLE9 and a replacement Wasabi battery is available for about $15.  The battery life is reasonably good considering all of the camera features it powers.The movie taking capacity of the camera is more advanced than most I have seen.  I have a modern dedicated video camera and it is less versatile than the Lumix GF6.  I must admit that I didn't buy the Lumix GF6 for its video capabilities and have only used it in test situations.  It seems to work surprisingly well.The following remarks are not complaints or flaws found with the Lumix GF6, but merely observations and things that I had to consider before buying the camera.First and foremost, the camera with the 14-42mm lens kit is certainly no pocket camera.  It is large compared to the standard point and shoot cameras.  I had to accept that fact in favor of improving my photographs with a camera that approaches professional status.The thing is big and a bit heavy to a person accustomed to those small pocket sized cameras.  I decided the GF6 could go with me on special occasions and to places close to home, but it won't travel in my pocket.Having said that, the camera has interchangeable lenses.  There is a smaller 'pancake' lens and a power zoom lens (Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42) available.  These are both a lot flatter than the 14-42mm lens kit that comes with the GF6.  I might buy one of those someday so I can carry my camera in a large pocket.Speaking of zooming--the 14-42mm lens kit on the GF6 doesn't do much compared to the 10x and 18x lenses on a pocket sized digital camera.  Again, there are Panasonic lenses available for the GF6 that can zoom to 175mm, but with one of those forget the pocket thing.The camera comes with a neck strap, but I didn't us it preferring to attach a wrist strap to my camera.  I didn't want to look like an old man in a tour group with a camera hanging around his neck.  I've been there and done that, but not lately.There is a way to transfer photos from the camera to a close by smartphone or tablet directly with a system they call NFC, but that only works with Android devices.  I knew NFC wouldn't work with my Apple iOS equipment, but the WiFi feature made up for that in my estimation.There is no view finder on the GF6, but I haven't used one of those since my SLR film camera days.  I guess some photographers can't live without a viewfinder.  I do very nicely without one.As you can tell from this review I am not a professional photographer and a lot of what I have said is not very technical.  I don't think Panasonic intended this to be a camera for photography experts.  The GF6 is a bridge camera designed for those of us that want to take the next step in photography. It is probably best suited for the advanced amateur.Can I recommend this Panasonic Lumix GF6--you bet I can.

I spent extra time online in viewing their video to be assured I installed it correctly.  It was very easy on my Nikon D-90.  Now I wonder if others were attempting to install pieces that were meant for round vs. square viewfinders.  Don't be scared of installation it was a piece of cake!I immediately fell in love with the Hoodsman.  I shoot lots of landscape shots and the ability to block out the light has tremendously improved my visibility on my subject matter.  No longer the glare or trying to view my instrumentation on bright sunny days through my viewfinder.  The price is great, installation very easy, and it does the job I want it to do...even when I shoot in portrait orientation.

$REVIEW.: Love the Cowon mp3 players and have always been gospel as the go-to player for audiophiles.  However, I found these days, when you're just listening to mp3 files at highest or near highest bit rate which is what most people listen to given they are readily found in itunes or Amazon, then this player is not really necessary.I thought I treat myself again to the best audio having taken a break from the audiophile world and its many blogs and reviews.  Seems like this is the best mp3 player offered from Cowon so I grabbed it regardless of the price.  I must say it feels quite a downgrade from the J3 which I also own, however, I do like the stealth/industrial look.  This does look like a player made for audiophiles as opposed to general listening public.  The android os while more practical takes a long time to boot up.  The touchscreen is extremely sluggish and no match for J3 touchscreen.  When comparing with my current player, the Sansa Clip, a very raw sounding player and respected player as well, there is almost no difference in terms of sound quality.  The use of Cowon's EQ would undoubtedly make it sound better than the Clip but I prefer my music no frills and the way it was meant to sound by the artist.Other than the Z2's outstanding battery life and friendlier menu, there is really no reason not to buy the Clip instead if you're just looking for sound quality.Again, this is testing with high quality mp3 files and results may be different if you listen to flac or large wav files.  I have tried the latter and comparison of latter with mp3 is like cd vs cassette tape.  I finally decided that I really don't want to spend time converting files or transferring large files to my player, and not to mention looking for these online which is almost impossible.  I decided to just go with the sensible approach of listening to high quality mp3 files.I would suggest a good set of headphones for anyone wanting to get the most mileage on their music.  And you need not spend the ridiculous amount of money on one either.  I own the Senn IE800 and I must say listening to high quality mp3s, it was only a tad clearer than the Panasonic RPHJE120D.  Price difference?

$review_text.: I used my Dremel tool to grind off the plastic on the lightning side.  It only took me a minute to carefully grind off around 1/8&amp;#34; high completely around the plastic and 1/16&amp;#34; deep.  Obviously, be careful not to touch the metal connector.  It's an easy job. Without a Dremel tool you also can do it with a small file - just takes a little longer.  Mine now works with any case without having to remove it.  Worth the work to buy it for less than an official Apple cable.

 Good quality, good design but a little expensive for a remote control

 Having a metal body makes it unique but it also means it can bend quite easily if you sit or lie on it
 It has a good feel in the hand, thin and small and is simple enough even for apple enthusiasts to figure out.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this card for a couple of weeks and it seems fine.  The problem is, this was my first high-capacity card, and I just now discovered that it doesn't work with my old, non-high-capacity SD card reader.  I wish I had seen something about this, because now I have to go get gouged at a brick-and-mortar store for a reader!  If you haven't bought this yet, consider getting it bundled with a new reader unless you're sure your existing reader works with SDHC.

I've continued to use a Sony Walkman all this time and the bulkiness of a Walkman finally got to me. So, I researched MP3 players quite a bit. The SanDisk SDMX22-004G-A57K Sansa Clip Zip 4 GB had all the features that I was looking for. I ordered a SanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC Class 4 Card along with this unit to give me a total of 36 GB. My feeling is that there was no need to spend the extra money for a Sansa 8 GB when I could add 32 more Gigs by using the money to purchase a card. At first, the MP3's I dragged and dropped into my Sansa wouldn't show up. After some research, I discovered that some of my MP3's were missing what's called an ID3. Once I downloaded a free trial of an ID3 editor and labeled all my MP3's, the MP3 songs showed up in the folders just fine. This is a great little unit. I went to the advanced EQ and set the type of EQ settings that I wanted. It's small and the clip is really valuable. I used to sit on the bus with my Walkman sitting on my lap and it would slide around but with this clip, it stays put. The buttons are easy to use and the screen, although small, is big enough to read. I highly recommend this unit. The accompanying ear buds are not bad but I have a pair of foldable sennheiser Px 200 that isolate outside noise and together, this is a great team. I'm very happy with this unit. Easy to use and very easy to carry around.

$review_text.: Great quality cable for a great price. I am currently using it on my PS2 and the graphics look much better than normal RGB. The quality of the cable and plugs is top notch but I wouldn't expect less from Sony.

Having said this, the lens itself is excellent, though it does not support f2.8 I found this lens to be amazing in indoor conditions where minimal day light was present. Sharp, fast focusing, low noise, distortion is a bit high compared to other wide angels in the same range, but nothing that cannot be fixed in Lightroom. Buying this lens means one is really interested in wide angel format of photography as in landscape, nature etc. With wide angel I do not mean indoor large party groups or wedding photographs with more than 6 people in it. No, the distortion would not look good on human photographs unless the distortion is intended for creativity sake. One need to know photography tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, Photomatix etc. If not, then I would recommend think before buying any wide angel lens. Overall, very excited with new lens and with summer approaching it is now time to exploit this poor fella :)

$REVIEW.: Overall, this is a great remote.  However, there are a few caveats.Pros:- Easy to program- Decent ergonomics for a large remote- Volume/mute pass through is awesome!Cons:- Pre-programmed list is very limited.  My sound bar was not in the list, and neither were a number of my TV functions.  The easy to use learning feature made up for this, except for the point mentioned below.- Has trouble learning some of the functions from my Sony remote.  Sometimes it gives an error, and sometimes it reports success but is unable to play it back.  After a few tries, I got everything but pause and FF to work.  I might get those if I keep trying.- Narrow IR angle compared to other remotes.
$review_summary.: Very nice remote

$review_text.: I haven't encountered any of the issues with sound drops that others have. Instead, I've found that this is an excellent media streaming device and Blu-Ray player for the price; while it doesn't have all the options (3D playback, for instance) that higher-priced players have, it handles almost all media streaming services and does so with aplomb, even over Wi-Fi. It also even supports WPA2-AES, which is shockingly uncommon among lower end devices. All in all, this is a great player that I'm happy to recommend.
$review_summary.: Brilliant device (for the price)

Better than a basic point and shoot. Samsung quality, lots of options, auto PC backup function is sweet, uploading to cloud drive is piece of cake. Only thing that has really been an issue is the Samsung link program has some bugs and issues that still need to be worked out. I just use the cloud drive upload function instead, that works for me. The other thing I noticed that when I first installed an SD card it seemed to have an issue recognizing it and had to remove and reinstall, that happened for about the first week every time I turned it on, but that seems to have subsided now. Not sure if it was a card issue or camera issue so cannot knock it for that. Lots and lots of options, manual settings available, touch screen works better than I was expecting, flash is decent. Take the time and download the manual and actually read it, you will be much happier. Yes I would buy it again or as a gift for someone. Good value, good product. Register it online with Samsung and add 3 months to your warranty. Happy shooting!

That system was absolutely phenomenal, but it was supposed to be, that was expected.  I decided to downgrade and pocket some cash to help finance my master's degree and sold the whole system off.  After some serious research I bought a used Yamaha AX-592 2 ch. integrated amplifier for $75.00 (mint), a Yamaha DVD-S2700 (list $1000.00) for $180.00 off ebay, and the Yamaha NS-555 tower speakers.  I was expecting disappointment, instead I received a pleasant surprise!  This inexpensive system is fantastic sounding!  This system proves the axiom of diminishing returns...You would have to spend $3000.00+ to equal this current system.  The sound as a whole is very clean with taut deep bass and clean, clear mids and highs.  My audiophile friends cannot believe the sound quality/price ratio!  At the price of the NS-555s I expected nasally voices, harsh highs, and sloppy, bloated bass.  Instead I found beautiful clean voicing, smooth treble and fantastic bass pitch and definition!  The NS-555s are not comparable to my former Dynaudios but they were never meant to be.  Yet, they compare very favorably to speakers costing 2 to 3 times as much.The NS-555s are only moderately efficient at 89dB 1w/m so they require a relatively powerful/high current amplifier to extract their potential.  They have a nominal impedance of 6 ohms and considering that loudspeakers generally vary to between 2 ohms to 16 ohms impedance, a stable, strong amp is highly recommended!  My Yamaha AX-592 outputs 140 wpc into 8 ohms, 220 wpc into 4 ohms and nearly 480 wpc into 2 ohms.  You would need one monster home theater receiver to approach these numbers and none that I know of can truly do it with 5 or more channels driven.  I will say it again give them power and they will sing!The very fine build quality of the NS-555s belies their price.  The cabinetry is solid but not over-the-top.  The cabinet is lined with padding, the crossover is very well put together with quality parts, the drivers are of nice quality and the finish is very nice, they look rather expensive.  I have received numerous compliments on their beauty.I most highly recommend the Yamaha NS-555 speakers to any aspiring audiophile.  These speakers are great for music and movies and I cannot imagine a better bang for-the-buck!  They have excelled at all generes of music from Miles Davis to Metallica.  Yamaha has found a way to bring high-end sound to the masses, all of my equipment is very well put together, looks very good and sounds fantastic!Excuse me, I am going to sit down and listen to some music on these fine speakers!!!

$review_text.: I've recently replaced my Linksys 802.11B router with this G-version and had no issues at all with the switch.  Plugged in, installed new software / drivers and I was ready to go in a matter of minutes.  The new version of the router has easy-to-use access to built-in firewalls and other tools to limit wireless access.  I'm using this with an updated PCMCIA card (also Linksys) without any issues - very fast, much faster than the old 802.11b.  I can actually use for online gaming without any significant degradation vs. being plugged directly in.  All in all, a solid product which I'd recommend if you're looking for a wireless router.

It worked perfect

If I could change my rating, I would give them a 5

They have the best Customer Service and monitor their products which a lot of companies do not
If you need any type of cables, I would give them a shot first
Prices are very good compared to what a lot of companies are asking and their cables are well constructed.Originally titled as Cable Does Not Seat Properly-I am very disappointed in this item as I have purchased Media Bridge items in the past and they have been of very good quality
For some reason this item will not seat and stay in my KENWOOD receiver

Any slight movement of the wire and it falls out of the receiver's digital socket

Because it does work, i will only give it a 2.

but as i said for 15 bucks it does what it's supposed to do

While I was searching the net, on Amazon.com I ran across the "Smart case" by i-BLASON

 I checked out the case and the reviews and what most got my attention was that it locked in this smart cover, and the colors they had were a perfect match for my dark gray cover


 After reading the reviews I decided that this is the case I wanted, so I put in order in through Amazon.com

 Within a very short time [approximately 3 days] I received the back cover in the mail
I snapped the cover on the back of my "I - pad 3" and I was immediately satisfied with the form and function of this product.1
 The fit was perfect and it looked great.2
 I really like the way it lacked in the smart cover, and prevented the cover from unexpectedly coming off.All in all, I definitely would recommend this cover for the iPad 3.

$review_text.: This camera costs roughly half as much as a Foscam, and does essentially the same thing. However, it's the kind of device that is so obviously cheaply made, you feel like you paid too much for it even at half the price. The picture quality through the (apparently) plastic lens is terrible. Everything looks like an abstract watercolor painting. There is no audio in/out on the back. There is a bright green flashing LED on the front, so forget the idea of this being an unobtrusive camera for a baby's room or some kind of secure area.If you're in the market for an IP camera, just get a Foscam. You won't miss anything if you pass on this one.

 My computer doesn't have an HDMI output, but it does have an output that I use to connect to a projector at work

 I had THOUGHT that this was a DVI connection, because it looked like the picture, but when the cable arrived it was far too large for the input.After further research, I found out that my computer has a VGA output, not a DVI


 What I needed was aVGA to HDMI Cable, which judging by reviews doesn't work very well anyways as you can't convert an analog signal to digital without an adaptor.So obviously, this cable didn't work and I had to return it

 This isn't the cable's fault, just mine for not being computer savvy enough to know the difference
Looking at reviews, I see that I am not the first one to make this mistake, and I hope this review will help others from doing the same thing.

$review_text.: Perfect for our teenage daughter.  Takes very good pictures.  The different settings for low-light, bright light, etc., are very useful.  Easy to manipulate the various settings.Software is easy to use, but I have disabled it from auto-starting in Windows because it is then always running, consuming cpu time (waiting for a camera to attach, and always checking for updates to the software) when, in fact, it *only* needs to be running when you are uploading pictures from the camera - technically, you can upload photos from the camera without the software even installed - but the software makes a nice organizer, editor, and viewer.Wish there was a little more memory on it - 32 meg - we will be getting an SD card to go with it.Highly recommend this camera for a very good starter digital camera.

$review_text.: To carry out this bag during trip, this bag was kind of big


If you focus on the portability about camera, this is a big bag


Buy another one


But, this bag is good for expert not just a private user.

It is cool all around.Took it camping this past weekend, got some excellant shots of the Mtns, made them look pretty close and clear even though they were far away...

$review_text.: My wife and I had a need for a portable speaker system for our iPods that could run off batteries.  Mainly because we go to places that we don't have access to plug things in.  This little system fits the bill perfectly.  It folds up nicely and can easily be stuffed in a travel bag to take on the go.  So far we only use this in battery operated mode and it has already provided us with hours of music without having to change the batteries.  The sound quality is what you'd expect for a compact speaker system.  This isn't a monster speaker system providing you with tons of bass.  If you want something like that you are going to need something that is larger and connects to a wall unit.  I would highly recommend this unit if you are looking for something relatively cheap, that you can use with your iPod to provide you with music while on the go.

I know a lot about cameras from working as a photographer's assistant for 8 years and did a lot of research before I bought this camera


 I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase

 It's a great camera for going out and I have no problem taking pics in a dark bar/club

 I've even been able to get decent hand-held pics at sporting events

 You may get red eye in close group shots, but that's to be expected with the flash placed so closly to the lense
 Anybody who says this camera doesn't take good pics does NOT know how to use a camera...The Auto setting is very user friendly and you should be ale to figure out the proper manual settings if you read the instructions.

The poor guy is sick with the flu and he was walking into the kitchen and dropped the tablet. The screen now has lines down it. He has the bumper case on it and it sounded like it barely hit,  the kid is only 3ft tall. Both my other kids have dropped their tablets with no case from higher and no issue. Not to mention how many time i have dropped my note 2. The product is not cheap, if you market it for kids with a "bumper" it should be able to take a 2' fall, in my opinion. I contacted customer support they said i have to send it in before they can tell me if it is covered. I will change the rating based on the results.*Update- Samsung says they will fix it for $160. What a joke. Do not buy this. Do not be fooled by the orange bumper. You even tap this product wrong and the screen might stop working. Any damage to the screen is not covered under warranty bear in mind this is not damage as in a crack or a even a scratch this is the screen no longer displays properly sorry not covered. So one has to wonder what does the supposed warranty cover.My son has been using the kindle fire with no issues dropped it from a shopping cart onto concrete and it didn't skip a beat. Do yourself a favor and don't pay $200 for a product marketed for kids that can't handle any bumps. Unless you want to pay $200 every few months.**Update 2-Zero success with Samsung, even though i reviewed the description of the product and it clearly states "Durable Case Holds Up against Drops and Spills". Samsung would only say sorry once the 3rd party repair company says the product was damaged due to physical damage we can't do anything about it. Which in itself seems questionable but anyway I moved on and was beginning the process to dispute it through my credit card. Then I thought you know this dispute will effect Amazon not Samsung let me give Amazon a chance to make it right. Amazon did and i couldn't be more grateful after dealing with very poor costumer service it was such a relief to know some companies will listen and do what is right. Thank you Amazon.

Although it's a loose fit with just the kit lens attached the case feels secure due to the design of the sleeve and flap - and I like having the extra length at the front of the case for when I have the longer zoom lens attached.  It's also easy to slip the camera in and out because the fit is not too snug.  I can also keep an extra battery wrapped in a cleaning cloth in the front of the case.  The snaps on the flap feel secure, but as I have only been using the case for a week I can't comment on their durability.  There is a pocket on the outside of the flap and it's got ample space for extra memory cards.

It's all set up and seems to work just fine, but it runs quite hot (on the UNO around the location of the power supply jack). This is my first experience with Arduino, so I have nothing to compare to; I've got an UNO, Ethernet Shield, and Relay Shield bundled together. I tried running with a 12V Netgear power supply at first after checking acceptable tolerances at the Arduino site, and then with the $6 9V supply suggested on the order page. Both run hot. I read a few posts online stating it could be the Ethernet Shield drawing too much power, but I'm not sure what to do about it yet. Fun project so far, hopefully I don't melt it trying to figure out how to keep things cool. For what it's worth, the one I received came with some little freeware/hacker/Arduino stickers and the board only, I didn't receive any cables or extras.

Only one of the two possible landscape orientations is supported, because in the other the volume control keeps getting activated. And when the iPad is charging, only one of the portrait orientations is supported, because there is no space for the charger cord. Some apps, by the way, require specific orientations, making the stand unusable with these apps.Why the manufacturer would not just design something for the iPad, rather than trying to throw in a design that works also for Kindles (which do not need a stand as much, as they are lighter) and generic tablets (which few people use), I do not know.Moreover, I found the product unhelpful for use while reading in bed, the angle is all wrong when one is lying down. There is also no way to secure the iPad - indeed it fell over once when I was trying to angle it for a more comfortable reading view. The manufacturer misrepresents the capabilities when it claims this product can be used for reading in bed, unless one actually sits up in bed of course.I will say that if one is sitting up in bed, then this product works well with an app like iBook (which allows the iPad to be used in any orientation). It is useful in that context. And the pillow support is good. But I prefer to read in bed lying down, i.e. at an obtuser angle.

There is absolutely no difference in an optical cable as long is it doesn't break mechanically

Quality of this product feels pretty goo, so no worries

So there is no reason to get an overpriced one from any specialist


They are just after your money.

$REVIEW.: First, to answer to critics' reviews I'd like to say that one shouldn't expect total quiet from the noise cancellation feature. The way how cancellation works -- by creating counter- noise sound for certain range of frequencies-- works great against street, plane type of noise.Though I'm not Sony's fan, I was pleased with sound quality and quieting I enjoyed in noisy flight. I can actually "hear" how noise-cancellation kicks-in when you turn switch on: noises fade, really amazing!I paid ~$[..] for these headphones. Only problem is somewhat stiff band, but this is an amazing replacement for your walkman/mp3 headphones. They flatten and fit well in my laptop pocket.Ran 4 hours on a new AAA cell and didn't need to replace battery it yet. Given the price --- 5-star!

$review_text.: Was hoping for a great product but was disappointed.  Even with Magic Words turned on, saying minikit did not work unless you screamed the word, then it would sometimes work.  Battery with Magic Words turned on was atrocious and would only last one day.  Phone would unpair unexpectedly.  I think that I may have gotten a bad item and am returning it for a replacement.  I really want the NEO to work and am going to give it another chance.  When it did work, I liked it, but that was not very often.  It does fit my visor perfectly and is totally unobtrusive which I liked.  After getting the replacement and using it, I will try to update this review.UPDATE.  I returned the NEO for a replacement as I liked how it was suppose to work.  I received the replacement NEO and it works perfectly .  I have turned off magic words and use the buttons to receive and hangup a call.  The battery lasts a few weeks with the way I use it.  I am completely satisfied with the purchase and hope I did not turn anyone off on this product with my first impressions.  I have been using it now for quite a few weeks and it has performed exactly as expected.

$REVIEW.: Beautiful sound from these in-ear headphones! Not very good on airplanes because the aircraft "engine drone" drowns out much of the sound, much less the incredible clarity that these are able to produce in a more quiet environment. Not the best in noisy locations either. The soft and exchangeable ear buds are among the most comfortable I've ever used but, after hours of use, I still experience ear fatigue.

 While not the best visual design it is well made

The seams at the bottom make the claims to water resistance a little tenuous
It should keep off rain but its doubtful that it would stay dry if dropped in a puddle


 Overall, its a solid product with plenty of space available given its small size.

$review_text.: I thought this was going to be a fun little camera to have; living in the Pacific Northwest, a waterproof camera is a great thing to have - it rains a lot here!  :-)  But the complicated menus made me give up on this camera after just a few days - I am not one easily intimidated by electronics, but this one I found little patience for.I loved the green look (NOT because I am into the politically correct "green" movement - it was just a pleasant color) and the heavy feel of the camera; it felt sturdy and it took pretty pictures and recorded clear videos.  But having to go through several steps to change even the simplest setting was something I decided I did not want to do.  I missed having more outside knobs and dials to use, which, of course, a waterproof camera wants to have fewer of; I thus decided I did not need a waterproof camera.I also thought the lens was in a rather awkward place in the top left corner.  I found myself having to move my left hand down, and thus found the camera somewhat uncomfortable to use.The editing software installed on the camera seemed good.  The flash, however, used in my medium sized living room in the evening, was too bright.  Taking pictures in that same room without a flash worked great, though, so no real need for the flash when the room was well lit by my lamps.Something else that bothered me was the lack of catching movement and "freezing" it - my two older cameras can do that without any problems - this one could not.  Perhaps there was a setting I did not find that could have corrected this?  I tried to find out, but could not in the time I familiarized myself with this camera.However, for somebody who wants a waterproof camera, it will be a great pick; the pictures and video's were great, but I returned it anyway.  Based on the short time I had it, I would, however, recommend it for somebody looking for a waterproof and somewhat funky looking camera.  It just wasn't for me.

I like the fact that it comes with a long and short cord


I'm pretty sure I won't use the long one that much but I can definitely see myself using it with a computer.I definitely recommended these headphones, because of the quality sound


I'm actually listening to the headphones while I write this review and I am absolutely enjoying it.

I am glad that I ordered this product because I am able to hide wires behind the wall plate that it comes with. I was originally going to run wires through the drywall but I realized that my house's construction of the exterior walls does not allow for enough room to pass the wires through.Like I said, easy assembly and the size of the glass shelf is large enough for my combo DVD VHS player. The glass seems to be of really good quality. It is tempered for safety. It is tinted.I mounted this into my wood wall studs.The only thing that you have to keep in mind when mounting this to the wall and lining it up with your TV is that it will not be centered with the TV. I installed mine under the right hand corner of the TV. This is because the wall studs are 16 inches apart. The mounting bracket for the TV cross 2 studs. If you are going to mount this into a stud, it can't be centered under the TV in this scenario. You can take the chance and use the drywall anchors to mount it differently, but I wouldn't. Comes with all the hardware that you would need.
$review_summary.: Great product with great size shelf, easy assembly and install

$REVIEW.: I purchased a used unit from a local pawn shop, and it works great. Everything functions as it should and the led lights within the speaker mesh look really sharp. I can't believe the difference it makes over the basic TV speakers. When I shut off this unit and put on the TV sound it sounds sick and I can't believe I listened for years. I would urge you that, unless you're TV has some type of high end sound, to purchase this or a similar unit.As for the BUT, well, I wish I had more control over the sound like maybe a 10 band graphic EQ. Granted that would make a complex piece of equipment more complex and expensive, but I watch a lot of basketball and the squeak of sneakers on a hardwood floor drives me nuts as reproduced on a Hi-Fi unit such as this. The pounding of the ball on the hardwood floor sounds and feels realistic with the sub-woofer and makes my TV experience better.Another factor that delayed my purchase was that when I had a full surround sound system there seemed to be a delay between someone's lips moving and hearing the voice. Between an object hitting the floor and hearing the sound. This unit has a slight delay compared to TV sound, but maybe I could adjust.
$review_summary.: Much Better than TV sound but.....

$REVIEW.: Bought the product and obviously drilled my desk based on its size and it turned out to be a disaster.It keeps disconnecting anything plugged to it, even a small USB flash drive. At first i thought it was the wire that came with it so i changed it, looked like it worked fine but a day later the same thing kept happening.Lost hope with it, i still have it plugged in just coz i'll end up with a huge hole in my desk. Extremely surprising as i've used many BELKIN devices and they all worked very well.The seller refused to send a replacement unit.

$REVIEW.: I was provided a 9To5Cables 15 Foot Ultra DVI to DVI Digital Dual-Link Cable for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&amp;#9830; The cable has a solid build with a heavy rubber cable and strong plastic DVI plugs on each end.&amp;#9830; 15 Foot length.&amp;#9830; Great graphics performance for a long length cable.&amp;#9830; Lifetime Warranty.Conclusion:I replaced my generic VGA cable with this 15 foot DVI to DVI cable and tried it out with my Windows 7 PC for general computing and with high bitrate 1080p video files and the cable performed just fine


 The video looked great, even with the longer length cable
 The cable has a very solid build and looks like it will last a long time


 If you are looking for a longer DVI to DVI cable that performs well at a reasonable price, this one is worth consideration.

$review_text.: I have purchased several of these kits
 Always for my clients with the most difficult home networking problems
 Too much distance, or interference to keep wireless working consistantly.The installation is a simple as it gets, power down the computer; plug a network cable from router to one of the adapters, and plug it into the nearest wall receptical; plug a network cable from the computer to the other adapter and plug it into the nearest wall receptical; power up the computer, and the network connection is made
 Never used the included installation software.Connection is steady, no drops, not quite as fast as a straight cable connection would be, but considerably faster than the wireless connect ever was.Amazon shipping was fast and simple, can't get better than this.

$review_text.: The New Trent Grabbit is like having three devices in one sleek and slim package. The 360 swivel design with the leather strap is amazing!!! The design allowed me to securely handle my iPad while grocery shopping and editing pictures, while I was on the go. My son used the included moviewall clip to hang the iPad on the wall in his room. This made him feel as if he had two TVs in his room...one to watch movies and the other for playing videos. The hard shell screen cover has provided extra protection from scratches and accidental dings. I'm a little clumsy!I wish that two leather straps and a clear screen protector were included for future use. I do recommend this product for its functionality, light weight and modern look.

$REVIEW.: Decided to buy this power supply for it's rating of efficiency and claimed quality of the components used to build it. Absolutely excellent quality all around. It comes in a sweet box and the main power supply unit itself is neatly sandwiched and tucked inside this foam square box that's protecting it from any impacts that could damage the unit while it's in the box. The extra stuff comes inside these nice white fabric bags. This unit being modular was truly a great idea on the maker's part as it makes life much easier not having to have to use all the wires. I only attached 2 of the cable attachments so far for my build and it's very clean in the case without all the other cables just laying around inside the case taking up space or constricting the air flow. I've been able to over clock my new Asus Sabertooth Z77 motherboard with a 3rd gen Core i5 CPU and 32GB of DDR3 RAM up to 4.5GHz so far and haven't had a hiccup, glitch or any weird behavior from the computer at all. This PSU is rock solid performance that's extremely stable for extreme gaming in Crysis 3 and just light browsing the net while listening to music type. Just feels exremely solid all around in my opinion and I love this power supply. Tried a few other ones in the past to save money on such components but finally chose to spend a little more for higher quality craftsmanship which I feel this power supply has delivered without a doubt from the box it came in to the performance it delivers inside the computer case. Everything has been nothing short of high quality about this product and I couldn't be more satisfied with buying this exact model. 100% worth the money if you are willing to put up a few extra bucks for getting a superiorly higher quality built power supply to power your other expensive components for your custom PC build.

The sound is somewhat tinny, and there is very little bass.  They don't produce a lot of sound either; they are only suitable for a small room.  They are a good option for someone on a very low budget (good for a dorm room), or someone looking for an inexpensive set of extra speakers.  They appear to be very portable, but what they don't show you in the product photo is that the speakers are wired to the main unit.  They're also a bit heavier than I expected them to be.  Although I have managed to carry all three pieces from one room to another without dropping anything, it wasn't easy.  If I wanted to take these to the beach or a picnic or on a trip, I would probably pack them up in the box they came in to prevent them from getting banged up.  It would have been great if they had devised a gadget with a handle to allow you to carry all the pieces easily, but they didn't.  I've also had some issues with getting the speaker unit to turn off when I have my iPod Classic plugged in (I also have an iPod Touch and I haven't had the same problems with it).  In addition I've had problems turning the volume up/down when my Classic is plugged in; it's as if the speakers freeze up.  I'm hoping this won't affect the performance of the speakers.  Another bonus to this unit is that it charges your iPod as you play music through the speakers.

$review_text.: This coiled 3.5mm male to male cable works, remains tidy compared to a non-coiled cable, and is very reasonably priced.  I was interested in this cable both to connect my iPhone to the aux-in jack in my car, and to connect a wireless microphone receiver to my camcorder.  Works well in both cases.I wouldn't really call it a 2 meter cable.  If you stretch it much beyond a meter /  3 feet, the tension on the cable might be enough to unplug one end or the other from your devices.  If you really need to reach 6 feet, get a non-coiled 6 foot cable.

i noticed some people saying it doesn't work for them, i can only say that once you understand how a radar detector works and set your unit up (mine came shipped with laser set to off even though the manual said the default was on) i think it does the job very well and is very reliable.

$REVIEW.: These worked decently while skiing to keep the interior dry
 I say decently because it still had a tendency to fog up, but we had to keep opening the door due to issues with the GoPro itself and you can only expect it to absorb so much moisture

 A bigger problem was they are not particularly easy to fit in the case, we had to cut them in half and stuff them in different places

 Every time you open the door they'd want to fall out and at the end of the trip they were all falling apart.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't sure what to expect at this price, but I'm impressed. Both arrived from UPS packed securely. Both have cases. The minute I pulled them out of their cases to take a look, I said, "WOW!"These lightstands are everything as described. Strong, sturdy, spring-loaded, incredible (and variable) footprint, solid feeling without being "heavy." I won't hesitate to use these outdoors in wind. (Can't say the same about the much lighter brand I ordered from Amazon last year.) I also wouldn't hesitate to mount my 40D on one of these, if necessary. (I would not even CONSIDER doing that with the other brand which, by comparison, seems fairly useless now.)These will easily and securely hold an umbrella mount and umbrella, lightbox (with multiple Speedlites), extension arm, etc.I cannot imagine that there is a better deal on lightstands of this quality (yes, they're "professional" quality) anywhere.Securely packaged and shipped fast.GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT DEAL!

If you got an E-something-'er-ether and are thinking you want to try out a small, prime, faster lens and you are on the fence about it; let me knock you off.It is "that much faster". In a room at 9am with 2 big windows, F2.8 it shoots at 320. This is a feat the kit F4 would have to struggle with at 25. In the sun, 11am, f2.8 I found it to shoot at 3200-4000 until with good white brick reflections it was overexposed and I had to pull it down to f16 (at which point it still shot in the 200 range. The sharpness is suburb throughout.If you have had difficulties with the kit lens's manual focus you will be impressed with this. The focusing is smooth and firm and the subject can be pulled into frame in split seconds. The action feels comfortable and natural with the left thumb as you clamp the top with the remaining fingers.It has a metal gasket that makes a tight fit. I'm not planing on putting mine to the test on purpose soon, but I would imagine it could stand up to some good wind blown dust and sprinkler mist that plagues us so. It seams to be built of a metal shell with plastic or resin coverings and the feel of it in your hands is like a little stone to skim across the pond.The kit lenses have a small skip at times when powering down, that of which I have not experienced at all with this.But it's not all great. The cap has been demeaned with all sorts of profanities and I completely know why. I managed to drop it twice on the first run! You may imagine it's raised but it is actually recessed with the exception of a small serrated ring. You have to push down and spin, there is nothing to pinch or pull.I can guarantee you will be happy with it. You will also be sure to find me with this lens on 95% of the time from now on. The kit lenses are only coming out for wide or tight occasions. I have found myself frustrated with the fact there are so few options in the 4/3 mount but I am no longer. Zuiko has proven themselves to me with this low end standard, I can only dare imagine what the high end (and the 45 years I'll have to work to pay them off) will hold.

$REVIEW.: Received the product within a couple days of purchase. Well packaged and protected. While opening and fiddeling with the product, it was incredibly hard to open the stand. Once I was able to pry open the bottom legs..it wasn't going anywhere. I attached a larger softbox to the stand and it held its own quite well.Pros: Stable, will not fall or come lose, Incredibly convenient/small, great for use as a small boom, low-level light during shoots[add a sandbag for heavier top attachments.]Cons: Very hard to open and close, have to losen all nuts on the legs then tighten to lock, no travel bag, surprisingly short.The price is worth it if you are on a budget[who isnt] and you are in need of a very short light/mic stand.

Since the camera consumes about 4GB per 12 minute clip, this card is good for around 48 minutes of 1080p 30/24 or 720p 60 video. The card appears fast enough to keep up with the high bitrate capture of the 7D's video mode. Be warned, however, it is not fast enough for continuous (high-speed) JPEG and/or JPEG-RAW capture. The 7D can be a speed demon at up to 8fps at full resolution. I also have Sandisk Extreme III cards (30MB/s) and they are noticeably faster. I can fill the buffer with the Kingston card, but not the Sandisk.That said, this card is about 1/2 the price of the Sandisk Extreme, and since I mainly wanted the card for HD Video capture, it performs up to my expectations. I've also had a 16GB version of this card for over a year and used it with my Canon 50D with no issues.I have NOT experienced any data corruption issues with this 32GB card or the 16GB card I've had for over a year. I would not hesitate in buying another one and plan on it very soon.

$REVIEW.: I bought this, even though I have several DVD/CD players, because I finally got a large flat-screen TV and I wanted a DVD player that (1) had an HDMI output, and (2) played Blu-Ray disks. I also bought a Hot Link Pro IR remote extender so I could store my new HD DirecTV receiver, my new Magnavox ZV427MG9 VCR/DVD player/recorder, and this Panasonic DMP-BDT320 Blu-Ray/DVD player in a closet in the next room and connect them all to my TV by HDMI cables through a hole in the wall hidden behind the TV. So far, everything works great together. And my DirecTV remote runs everything, including this Panasonic. I haven't tried it with a Blu-Ray disk yet, but it plays DVDs just fine. I'll update this review periodically so as to include longevity reports.

$REVIEW.: Before buying this, I had a mix of cables, plus an older, but good quality HDMI switch.  When I got AT&amp;T; uVerse, I began having problems with errors flashing on the screen for HDCP, sometimes not allowing me to watch.I really wasn't sure of the cause, so I replaced the old cables, and also replaced the switch with a cheap, new switch at the same time.  I had no problems after that.It probably wasn't the cables that caused the problem, but I can say that the new cables were high quality and caused no problems with my picky source.

$REVIEW.: I've only had the product A week or so but it seems good. Mine is used but it doesnt make a difference really esp on a solid state drive.  I didn't see too much of a performance pick up yet...although I also didnt set it for the correct mode. In bios you can set it to ide mode (slower) or the other mode that is for sata drives. My system was pretty snappy already with dual core and new board but this is perfect if you want the latest thing to make sure you give your os a chance to be snappy as well.I recommend it on general principle for use as a OS drive. 60gb is plenty of room and yes this drive e gives you access to the full 60gb

$REVIEW.: This thing does exactly what it's supposed to, and the functions are smooth and firm.  The build feels solid, and it has easy to clean flat surfaces.  Can't think of anything to knock off a star for.Notes:-The online software for storing your movie sheets is pretty darn nice.  Very simple, which I like, especially in a tedious task like entering all your movies into a DB! You can shuffle a space from the bottom of the list into the middle, or perform edits.-Saves a lot of space-Gets pretty hefty when it's full (100 DVDs weigh bit).  I recommend setting it someplace where you can access it as it sits without moving it.  I pull it out of a bookshelf when I want to grab a movie, so I have to be careful.

$REVIEW.: After the firmware update this router worked flawlessly.  It had great features and excellent performance on my home network where we have many devices, connect to corporate networks, and have big downloads.  Alas, after 13 months the 2.4GHz radio failed completely.  The 5GHz radio still works, but my older computers and some of my mobile devices do not have a 5GHz WiFi radio, and I'm not confident that the 5GHz radio will continue to work for long.  Sorry, Netgear, I'm going back to Linksys, or maybe Asus.

I have added a bluray player and a new plasma.  The H/K was running out of open connections.  I began with the Onkyo 606 which I got at Circuit City for $379.  It had a great power section, but ran very hot.  The biggest issue was every  time an explosion or a flash would go off on the screen, I would lose video signal to my projector.  Returned it and purchased the Yamaha 663.  Very clean and clear through my Jamo surround setup.  I won't elaborate on details because much has already been said about the quality of the Yamaha.  A week after I got the Yamaha, CC ran the Denon 988 for $650 on closeout (same as the Denon 2808).  I had high expectations since it retails for $1200.  Bottom line is it sounded about the same as the Yamaha.  I got the Yamaha for $430 at Best Buy and can't justify the extra $$ for the Denon name.  Also was not as user friendly as the Yamaha.  With my particular setup, the Yamaha gave Denon performance at a much lower price.  Hope this helps anyone decide as these 3 receivers are very close in features.

The D7000 series also renders a superb picture, but slightly different than what we saw last year. First, let's start with the Picture Mode options which are fairly limited compared to many TVs we review. Preset Modes are Dynamic, Standard, Movie, and Relax. The Relax and Movie modes are pretty solid right out the box. We ISF calibrated the picture from the Movie Mode to D6500K and post those picture settings on the next page. We then measured peak brightness and peak black to determine a range of contrast and this is where we were first surprised. Contrast measures about half on the D7000 series than it did last year. We found the reason for the decrease to be less light output (brightness) rather than black performance. We attribute this decrease to one or both of the following explanations: 1) Plasma panel Image retention (not burn in) issues could have influenced Samsung to decrease light output and/or 2) Samsung had to reduce light output to meet internal or external energy consumption reduction requirements. Indeed as it relates to the second possible reason, there is a yellow sticker affixed to the TV that states an average annual $28 in power costs. OK, I can see a small reduction in light output to accommodate the first of these, but power costs? I think I prefer to pay an extra $1 per month or even $2 more per month to get a better contrast ratio. Haven't we gone overboard enough with this energy efficiency when it comes to TVs? We here at 3D-TVBuyingGuide.com are proponents of the best picture quality possible and not at the expense of the lowering the power bill by a buck a month to meet an external non-profit agencies requirements.OK, that said, how is the picture quality? Excellent, just like last year. Colors are realistic and explosive, black levels are inky deep, dark shadow detail is excellent even with dark and light colors in the scene. The latter of these attributes is one of the traits that sets these plasma TVs apart from LED and LCD technologies. That and off center side angle viewing which is perfect on this plasma as it is with most. There is no false countouring or mapping of color information. The only weaknesses with the picture is judder jerkiness during slow panning side to side and peak light output. The first of these weaknesses is present in almost all TVs, the second causes us to recommend this TV for light controlled rooms.3D TV Viewing: 3D viewing is much improved from last year. The PN51D7000 is full HD active shutter 3D and comes with Samsung's 3D starter kit which includes 2 pairs of active shutter 3D glasses model SSD-3100GB and a Shrek 3D movie. The TV recognizes when the 3D glasses are synced and an alert pops up on the screen stating, "3D Glasses are now connected." Many of the issues we noted last year are gone. There was no blurring in the bottom left and right corners of the screen. There was no crosstalk and flashing from the glasses from ambient room light. Images looked great and the depth is excellent depending on the 3D movie. The PND7000 3D plasma technology does justice to 3D technology. It certainly involves you in the picture. We did note some eye fatigue after viewing for a while but not as much as last year.Picture Quality Rating (Non-HD): 9/10Up conversion of lower end signals is very impressive on the PN51D7000. This is important due to the way we increasingly watch TV these days - through Internet TV programming like Netflix, Hulu and Vudu. These services do not always transmit their signals in HD and even when it is, it's usually a ramped down 720p HD rather than 1080p. Many times you are watching something akin to 480i or 480p resolution. So a good quality up conversion in a TV is essential and to get this you will likely need to go to a more high end solution like the D7000. Color information was very good despite the fact that you cannot adjust picture settings from the Smart Hub Internet options. The tools key will get you into the Sound Mode options but that's it. Nevertheless, in the end we were happy with the color, black levels, and especially the dark shadow detail on this TV.Features Rating: 9.5Internet Connectivity Smart Hub: Samsung's Smart Hub has probably the best selection of Internet TV Apps and Options on the market. There are the usual must haves like Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, ESPN, USA Today, AP, Accuweather. Some of the Apps are more worthy than others. The MLB.tv App shows todays game times and scores, and standings but no video clips or reruns. If you want to access the games, you'll have to subscribe to the premium service. Many small Apps like Pac man or various workout video apps cost between .99 and 2.99 each. One drawback of Samsung's Smart Hub is that you cannot access the picture menu to calibrate the picture. You must just watch it as it comes in - not that performance is poor, it isnt at all, but it's always nice to be able to calibrate the settings.Design and Appearance: The Samsung PN51D7000 looks much the same as the PND8000 series from last year except with a thinner framing bezel. It's a great looking set. The thin 1" brushed charcoal metallic finish lends a very expensive look and the depth of the TV is the same at just 1.4". There is a thick glass edging all the way around the TV. The screen when off is a deep rich charcoal color. The TV comes with a solidly built heavy table top which swivels 21 degrees side to side. Lastly, the neck is a clear acrylic piece that makes the TV look as if it's floating in air.Audio Output Quality: Audio output was impressive from the 10W X 10W speakers. Compared to most super thin TVs these days, sound from the PND7000's speakers is much fuller with more base and better quality. There was plenty of volume to fill a large room at the 50% level. There are impressively 5 Sound Mode options whereas most TVs only have two. We have preferred the Clear Voice option in the past so give that one a try. The Standard mode is also good. Music was not great but we felt the sound quality was well balanced.Value Rating: 9.5/10The PN51D7000 is an extremely attractive TV that has a classy and expensive looking casing to go with a superb picture quality and features. With excellent 3D performance and great black levels this TV is tough to compete with at a price $1647 from authorized online dealers. A Samsung 3D starter kit with 2 pairs of 3D shutter glasses and a free 3D movie or two will cost an extra $398 - though some retailers may charge a higher price for the TV but include the starter kit.See the full review along with our video review at 3D TV Buying Guide

To everyone else, I highly recommend this router

 We've had it for a couple of months and it is great
 On my previous Belkin router, I was having trouble maintaining the connection to my company's VPN
 The Belkin couldn't handle the connection


 This router handled the connection with ease
 The setup is very quick and easy


 If you don't have experience manually setting up routers, then follow the instructions on the quick setup guide and setup will go along very quickly
I highly recommend this router.

I thought about just buying tweeters for the dash but i figured a little extra mid range would help, and that was the right decision!These speakers come with a sticky foam pad the works kinda like a gasket for the speaker, it helps with the vibrations A LOT!they also come with two extra resistors or bass blockers, i used though and i'm very glad i did


I soldered and heat shrunk all the connections.I have these infinity reference 3.5" in the dash, 6.5" infinity reference custom mounted in the door, and infinity reference 6x8's in the rear panel and they sound absolutely amazing! i have previously owned, pioneer, Boston acoustic, and alpine speakers and by far these are my favorite


They are so good I'm thinking about replacing the 4 brand new Pioneer 6x8"s in my explorer just because i am so thrilled with these speakers.Bass output on these speakers is very good, these speakers sound great if you turn the bass way up, i have not been able to hear ANY distortion in these even at maximum bass.However, these speakers can go both ways


I have mine tweaked so that the produce mid-range and high-range only, since i have a bazooka SUB in the back, but i will soon replace that with an infinity basslink system.Overall these speakers are great for anyone, if you just need a simple, cheap replacement or want to go all out and build a great system these speakers will do it all, without issues


I have a new found love for the infinity brand, they are a great quality piece at an amazing price everyone can afford.Don't waste your money on all the fancy </review_text><review_summary>Good screen protector</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3CJOD8LBM8ZMV"><latest_review_date>30/06/2010</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0021L9BZQ</product_id><review_date>30/06/2010</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Works like a charm</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3CKD0XQUQRM5M"><latest_review_date>15/10/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B003B56LFY</product_id><review_date>15/10/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Great mouse</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3CL82UITQJLWS"><latest_review_date>04/09/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0002KQR1Y</product_id><review_date>04/09/2014</review_date><review_helpful>[6, 8]</review_helpful><review_text /><review_summary>Good all around keyboard with major limitation</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3CMBKA5KVTVBE"><latest_review_date>22/01/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B003UOIMBW</product_id><review_date>22/01/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>This is my review of non Red version, but it is the same. Red version is even better for those who like the color!There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! First, if you have not had any tablets before, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 7&amp;#34;. It is ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7&amp;#34; Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7&amp;#34; form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8&amp;#34;. In my opinion 8&amp;#34; is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8&amp;#34; a 5 star. I gave 7&amp;#34; a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10&amp;#34; also a 4 star because of some strange spec `limitations'.Samsung has introduced 7&amp;#34;, 8&amp;#34; and 10.1&amp;#34; of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10&amp;#34; lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10&amp;#34; Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 2 model.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 oz. (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.9 oz. (309 grams) Android 4.210.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz. (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 7&amp;#34; has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs only 300 gm. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.Galaxy Tab 2 is 345 grams, so Tab 3 is lighter by 45 grams.  Processors are similar 1.2 GHz dual core in Tab 3 Vs 1 GHz dual core in Tab 2. Resolutions are same with Tab 2 1024 x 600 pixels (~170 ppi pixel density). Tab 3 supports up to 64 GB whereas Tab2 is 32 GB. Not a big deal unless you have tons of video/photo/ebooks/music you want to carry with you all the time. I use a mixture of on device storage + Google Music + box for my data needs.  Battery is also same between Tab 2 and Tab 3 7&amp;#34; versions - Non-removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery.Both have Bluetooth 3.0.  I cannot confirm still if Tab 3 7&amp;#34; supports OTG.  I know for sure Tab 3 8&amp;#34; supports as I tested it.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7&amp;#34; does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. 7&amp;#34; is equally capable as a 8in for `most' day to day apps. If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos 7&amp;#34; is more than enough. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10&amp;#34;, 12&amp;#34; 13&amp;#34;, 15, 17 and even some 19&amp;#34; if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate.

$review_text.: The Tablet is good, I have had some problems with the WIFI connection, which could be a little annoying sometimes, but I have been able to manage with that.The bad thing with this model is that you can't use Android Market, I find impossible to install it and that's really disappointing.A 3G connection capability would be great too.

The carry handle allows you to grab and go and also allows you to prop it up. I would have given it 5 Stars but didn't because it took me 10 minutes to get the  ##**!! thing on. I had to call on my inner power to get my IPad into the ArmorBox. It did not come with instruction on how to which implies this should have been simple, it wasn't. Oh yea, it feels durable but I haven't dropped it so I can't say if it will stop damage from being done but it looks and feels like it will cover down and do the job. I do miss my smart flap and would recommend that feature be added.

$review_text.: I am in Washington DC in a condo complex facing other buildings and the south side only, so I was hoping to get at least a few useful OTA channels with this unit and my new LED TV. I got 37 channels, many of them the major stations and good programming!  It was a nice surprise and very flexible installation location for the same results. This will be a good backup to my cable, if it ever goes out!

$REVIEW.: I needed something to lug to work and back with a bit more space than my briefcase.  Although I see plenty of adults on the street with backpacks these days, I wasn't sure if it was kosher yet in the corporate world.  I bought this one mainly on it's looks: I think its clean, subdued styling looks more mature than most packs.I've been hauling this to work every day for a week now, and it hasn't raised any eyebrows yet, so I feel its lived up to my expectations.  It seems fairly well made.  I'm not sure how well it'd hold up to heavy usage, but for the kind of light loads I carry, I expect this to last a fairly long time.The main body is split into two compartments.  The one closest to your back is a padded compartment for a laptop.  The other is a larger compartment that is big enough to fit my massive 60 oz thermos and a few items to the side of it, though only just.

 Good feel to the keys.Issues I had to find fixes for:The keyboard would go to sleep and I would miss the first letter or two when typing
 It would sleep after less than 30 seconds
 This seems to be a bug in Bluetooth 3.0 under Windows 7

 Adjusting the Bluetooth properties to not allow Bluetooth to power down the keyboard solved the problem.No insert key

 This is the only key I miss and I use it a lot in Word.My solution was to add the Overtype command to the Quick Access Ribbon Bar.Clicking on the icon turns Insert on/off.Other:The keyboard lies flat with no 'legs' to rise it up
 You can purchase stick-on 'legs'


 Search for  Laptop legs.However flat works for me.

$review_text.: I purchased this netbook in January based on quite a few factors, including very detailed user reviews on Amazon. I upgraded the memory to 2GB, bought a pretty skin for it, and started dragging it everywhere with me (in my purse, with a protective neoprene case to keep dust out). After 6 months, here are my conclustions:1) I definitely purchased the right netbook. This is an awesome little machine. It's like the little netbook that could.2) The 2GB memory upgrade is essential3) Find an updated online guide for the most useful Netbook apps. You'll find light apps that will help you get the most of your netbook's productivity without sacrificing precious screen area or limited CPU cycles. They also help recommend apps to add functionality to the netbook that you wouldn't even think you needed.4) OpenOffice is a great, great free application that doesn't bog down your netbookNetbook is best used for:Writing on the goWatching moviesDownloading thingsPros1) The battery life is ridiculously amazing, depending on what you are doing and what battery mode it is in2) You can have more apps running than you would think3) The screen is beautiful4) The builtin camera is nice and easy to use5) The sound is really good6) The keyboard is easy to type on - I wanted the chiclet style, and it works greatCons1) The 2 finger scrolling thing never worked great for me, possibly because of the type of skin I put on it. But the trackpad is so small that the 2 finger commands and features seem kind of pointless2) The battery did NOT last as well in sleep or hibernate mode as I expected3) The wifi was really really finicky. It was, in fact, kind of crappy. I was constantly having to reset my wireless router at home and my friends/family's houses to get it to connect. It was also constantly having to repair its connection and would sometimes drop unexpectedly. Meanwhile, my full sized laptop, my iphone, and/or my ipad would be using the same wireless connection without a hiccup4) It would not reboot or come back from sleep/hibernate nicely. The reboot issue was almost constant, but the waking up issue just happened periodically. In both cases I would have to fully power down the device and start it up again to get it to come up. I tried updating windows and the Asus update (including Bios updates) to no avail.5) Streaming video really sucked. Movie playback was awesome if the media was on the drive, not if you were streaming content online. This may partly have been due to the wireless issues but I suspect it just didn't have enough cache to buffer properly. I added an SD card to boost performance and tweaked many settings but nothing helped with the lack of buffering. I could not instant watch netflix or youtube videos on it at all because of the constant stuttering. There may actually have been a problem with the wireless, I never contacted support about the issue because it didn't really matter to me.I primarily purchased the netbook for the extended battery life so I could write or watch downloaded movies while traveling and it did exactly what I wanted. The cons I listed didn't impact me that much because I have so many other computers etc that I would use for those activities anyway. For someone who really wants to stream video or for whom the connectivity issues would be more than a minor annoyance, I'm assuming that contacting Asus support would help to resolve - I don't know if that is a common problem at all.I'm using the past tense because I recently purchased an iPad and just today sold my netbook (sad! I will miss it!). The iPad has a slightly larger screen area which is making a big difference for me - and is significantly lighter than the netbook. Also, the wifi works better. No USB ports, which is what delayed me in purchasing an iPad until now, but I decided to get over it.

$REVIEW.: I have had the this TV (TC-P65VT60) for approximately three weeks.  While the picture rates 5 stars, the technical support, which I have queried 8 times is the worst I have ever seen, staffed by untrained morons, including the supervisors I have spoken with.  It is so bad that I have vowed NEVER to buy any other Panasonic TV in my lifetime.  I realize that the average rating might be considered the average, but a 0 and a 5 still comes out to 1, the least allowed, in my book.To start off with, parts were missing, mainly screws but also other things in the torn bag that had been dumped into the box.  It took two full weeks for them to send me the WRONG parts. No person in tech support for all of the above named eight phone calls has EVER been able to answer even the simplest of questions.  On the last question regarding the facial recognition camera which only points at the upper part of the opposite wall with no apparent adjustment, requiring me to stand on a stool in order for the camera to see me, I cannot get it to register my face at all.  I have called THREE times to report this and get progress updates, and the idiots only say initially that it needed to be elevated to another level and I would be telephoned.  After three weeks there has been no call and on the two subsequent queries by me I have been told they are "working on it" and I will be contacted.  Honestly, THREE WEEKS!Some will respond and complain that I should have just evaluated the TV alone, but, IMHO, the support service is just as much a part of the service as the quality of the product.  If you can't get it to do all you have paid for and you can obtain absolutely no help, then tech support IS a relevant purchase issue.In addition to the tech support issues, I must comment on the extremely poorly written and unhelpful written manual.  What good is a TV with a terrible manual and poor tech support??  One more issue is the fact that assembly of the TV on to its stand will require 2-3 able bodied people and that the TV does NOT swivel on its base, a major shortcoming IMO.

having said that, connection between flash drive and extension cable continues to work fine

I use it to hold my media, and I've never had any issues with performance - I can wirelessly stream HD video from this HDD in my office PC to my home theater PC without any hiccups.And then last night, as I was working (and not using that drive for anything intensive, I might add), I started getting terrifying messages from my HDD monitor software AND from Windows - the reallocated sector count was suddenly through the roof, and this drive was ready to die.I checked the logs on my hard drive monitoring software, and between 6:00PM and 7:00PM, the "health" of the reallocated sector count had nose-dived from 100% to 12%. About 24 hours later, it's at 2%...Apparently I'm not the only one with the issue - after doing some browsing and troubleshooting, I found that this was a common enough problem with this model, and Seagate gave me an RMA number without even being asked (their recovery software popped up with a "Warranty Code" after it told me it couldn't solve the problem).That was disappointing, and I'm still not sure how it happened so quickly. The drive's under 1 year old, and there wasn't any physical reason for its reliability to suddenly tank (no jarring of the desktop tower, drive temperature wasn't too bad, etc).So why am I still giving it 3 stars?1. S.M.A.R.T is a really nice feauture; there's nothing worse than instant hard drive death with no warning at all. At least I can still salvage anything valuable from this drive before it's completely broken.2. Seagate's customer support rep was fantastic. I asked her if it was possible to get a replacement drive BEFORE returning this one (so I don't have to juggle 1.5TB of data in the meantime), and she was able to give me a free "priority return", which essentially means that I'll get my replacement drive in the next 5 days, with a box and prepaid packing slip I can use to return the defective drive.

$REVIEW.: Everything you would need for your Kindle


It is safe...


Holds the Kindle securely without it slipping out

The colors are beautiful
Finally, there is a case that uncovers all the buttons and exposes the camera nicely


It quickly and very easily bends in different ways for a great level of viewing
I bought if for a friend whose arms and shake hands constantly and he has no problem using this case and bending it so he can view his movies

This is the perfect case for the Kindle HDX 8.9 and so far there is nothing about it I don't like


Actually, when I'm through with this review, I'm going to buy one for my own Kindle.

It took me a bit of fumbling around to find out how - it isn't in the manual how to do it.-When your 2D movie comes up press the &amp;#34;Display&amp;#34; button and go from there.  After that it is pretty self explanatory.  There are 3 levels of &amp;#34;virtual 3D&amp;#34; but they looked pretty much the same to my eyes.- All of this does require the use of a 3D TV of course - it had to be said for some.This player has the most online 'channels' I have seen on a BluRay player too.  I am so glad that I had issues with the first 3D player I bought (samsung) and then decided to get this one instead.Highly recommend this player especially if 2D to 3D upconversion is a priority and also because of the many online streaming options included in the player.

Built-In USB!  GPS!So those are the positives and they are somewhat impressive.  However, keep in mind that it is HDD storage and NOT solid state memory.  You'll need to insert a SD card into the included SD card slot if you want solid state memory.Sony has decided to place the microphone pickups right at the front (under the lens) which means that you are near certain to pickup wind noise while recording.  In fairness, it was minimal but it was evident.Battery use is fast and depletes faster than solid state because of the HDD moving parts.  Carry a backup.BUT....  What is most important is the quality of the video.  This camcorder has so many positives but when it comes to picture quality, you'll find a severe lack of pixel resolution.  Colors will be impressive and even low light indoor video came in with impressive results.  The negative was sub-par video.  Just no details.  No sharpness.  Low lines of resolution.  We used both 60i and 60p.  Maximum quality settings and as said, got great colors but just no details.  Can't see a human hair, a flower, a garden leaf or a blade of grass.  Playback was using HDMI to a 1080p TV.Sony did a fairly good job of including massive storage, 5.1 sound and GPS.  What I wanted mostly was resolution and this model doesn't offer that.I did not use the photo/still aspect as I purchased a camcorder and not a digital still camera.

$REVIEW.: Great remote controll for my PS3 to view my Blue Ray movies or dlc movies from the PSN store. I noticed there are extra feature that is including with this remote, which i have not used yet. I love the fact the battery life is pretty long as well. I noticed I had to replace the battery every 5 to 6 months which i thought was awwwwsome from a Bluetooth device. The best is the easy sync to the PS3 console. Worth every penny.
$review_summary.: Great Remote, with too many buttons that I dont use.

$review_text.: When I received this case, I was genuinely impressed with the packaging: it entirely encased in a box which completely protected it in transit (unlike a few other cases I had ordered). The package whispered, "class." Nonetheless, when I slid the case out of the box, I was stunned at the plastic texture. And, it appears as "cheap" as it feels. In fact, there is large, visible ripple in the back of the case where one folds it. So, even when the case is closed, it has the appearance of water damage. The elastic strap (as seen on Moleskine products), it a nice touch to keep the case closed, but it simply cannot make up for the fact that the case is genuinely flawed in design.On a positive note, the inside is a similar grey color, but is a very soft, protective fabric.As noted by another reviewer, without a pre-made crease, it is awkward to fold this product and it really does make the product less and less attractive the more one uses it. Disappointing.There are a number of fantastic cases on the market. This is definitely not one of them. Hey, you already invested in your Kindle, why not invest just a bit more to keep it safe and show it off?

$REVIEW.: I really like the way the &amp;#34;origami&amp;#34; works on this case.  The design was a bit confusing at first but it's a really easy technique...just pinch the two corners into the middle and you can orient the iPad horizontally or vertically, something not many covers this slim can do.  I also like that you can fold the cover in a more traditional &amp;#34;roll up&amp;#34; fashion for a lower desktop-like position.  The material has a smooth, slightly rubbery texture and the fit is perfect.  It snaps shut securely and stays put until it's opened.  The generous cutouts around the switches and ports also provide easy access--important if you have any large plugs.  This is a great choice if you're looking for durable, lightweight protection.

It looks really sharp over the ipod touch's silver back (the case is slightly transparent), is easy enough to get on and off (when I switch to an armband case for exercise), and seems pretty durable. I think the only downside is that it's just a bit too large to fit inside DLO's armband case --- otherwise, it would be a perfect combo.A friend of mine has her iPhone in a regular hard plastic case, and the thing snapped at the hinges only a week after having it, due to her taking the phone out to put in an armband case. The material for this case is tough enough not to bend all over the place, but pliant enough to get the iPod out easily and quickly if need be.

There is no signal transmition problems like missing sound or interferance. The connections are good enough that the cable wont fall out, but the connection is not as tight as most coaxial connections. Just be sure to have some slack in the lines.

The AC adapter is HUGE!  It is over twice as big as the hub

Not sure what IOGEAR was thinking but the adapter covers BOTH sockets on the wall plug and will NOT fit in my power strip at all
To complicate matters, the cord is only about 4 feet long (instead of the standard 6 feet on other products).2


The USB 3.0 cable is extremely SHORT!  It measures a mere 39 inches

The distance from my USB 3.0 card in the computer to my desktop is about 5 feet
 Now I have to wait to find either a longer cable or a USB 3.0 extension cable before I can even use this hub.Sadly, most companies today may still make good products but then cut corners by using cheap OEM cords and cables to save money
If I can get this to work, I will use it but I will think twice before buying an IOGEAR product again

 You should do the same
If you decided to purchase this hub, be sure to buy an extension cord and extra long USB 3.0 cable.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this item primarily because the 504 lacks its own stand.  It's really nice to view it without having to lay it flat or hold it in your hands.  But there are two problems with the "stand" function.  It is at a near vertical angle, which is not optimal for viewing, and it can tip forward when you are trying to set it up.  The second problem is that the snap that holds the cover in place to function as a stand, pops out really easily.  It takes some effort to get it to stand properly.  The other really annoying problem is that it is a little too small for the device.  It's made of really tough leather (not the soft kind), so it offers great protection, but it also doesn't "give" much.  It's like buying a leather shoe that is a little too small.  You either have to wear it for a long time, or you have to use a shoe stretcher.  I imagine these things are not hand made, so if mine is too small, yours probably will be too.  You would think they would have made it the correct size!  Anyway, because there is no other option, I would probably still have bought it because I love carrying my memories around with me in the 504.  I wouldn't say stay away from it, but beware!

$REVIEW.: Laptop arrived in time, shipment was as expected. The laptop is working as expected too, will not make a big review, just to say that is a very good machine.Some reviews are saying that the sound is not good quality, and that made me doubt to buy it but honestly the sound is very very good with two Harman Cardon speakers. Of course you will not get high bass sound due to the vibration that can affect the machine components like the hard drive but is very configurable.Just one cons: the webcam, is worst than a 1990 webcam, that bad it is, all the rest perfect and smooth.Happy with this laptop I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: You simply can&amp;#8217;t beat these small speakers for the price.  The sound quality is very good. . . again for the size of the speakers and the price.  Easy one knob control.There is only one thing. . .  .. and that is.  . .I don&amp;#8217;t understand why you have to plug in the speakers to your USB port, and also plug them into the audio.  It&amp;#8217;s redundant.  I don&amp;#8217;t understand why they couldn&amp;#8217;t have been designed to work simply by plugging them into the USB port.  It&amp;#8217;s just a minor thing, but it would have been nice if they had been designed this way.

$review_text.: Works ok for the price, had an issue where it would always switch to HDMI 2 after an undetermined amount of time, even though there was nothing plugged into HDMI 2


 &amp;#34;Fixed&amp;#34; this by putting the device that's used most often into HDMI2 port and changing the others around.

Yes, it scans, to find active frequencies to store, but it does NOT scan when trying to monitor. Even if it did this, it still misses through its lack of squelch. I don't mind "white noise" but even living just 6 miles from LaGuardia and monitoring tower/arrival/departure, after a few minutes, the noise is unbearable, being more than twice as loud as communications when they happen. So, turn the volume down for reasonable level of white noise, and you can't hear what's being said! Turn the voices up to where you can actually hear what's being said, and when they are done (which is usually very quickly) you are almost tossed across the room by the painfully loud static again. I'm trashing this radio and trying the Uniden desk top scanner next. At least it has a squelch control... stay tuned!

$REVIEW.: I needed a new switch for my bedroom since my old Netgear 5 port switch did not have enough ports to work with the number of devices I have accumulated in my room.  The upside to this update was the fact that the TP-Link is a lot faster, as well.  My Netgear was limited to 10/100 and the upgraded speed is very noticeable.  I have an Airport Express that plugs into it that I use for music and as a separate wireless network to get more range for wireless devices.  Plugging the Airport Express into the TP-LInk has made everything a lot faster than it was before.I should mention that this was plug and play.  I simply unplugged the cables from my old router and plugged them into the TP-LINK and plugged it in.  Everything worked without a problem.My main complaint, which is not limited to this device, is the plug for the power socket is on one side and the ethernet ports are on the other.  So, no matter how you put it in your system, you see cables.  I have my TP_Link hidden behind some gear, so you can't see it without moving stuff out of the way.  For home use, I prefer something that looks like the Airport Extreme, but this has a lot more ports, so you just need to find a place to put it where it won't be seen.

$review_text.: I borrowed this lens from a pro photgrapher friend who purchased it in Japan (have since purchased my own lens).  Paired it up with my new Olympus OMD E-5 Micro 4/3 and was totally blown away by the lens and of course camera combination.  The other reviewer went into great detail about it's technical merits - so wont bore you with mine as he was spot on and we are on the same page.This lens coupled with the OMD E-5 produced photographs as good as my Nikon D700 with fixed prime lens at a much lighter weight factor.  Could not beleive the quality of the construction on lens and camera - both built like Army tanks.  The Lens (like the camera) is all metal, very small not quite 3" in length.  AF is very smooth and the zoom is manual via turning a ring on the lens with absolutely no slippage.  Unlike most of the Oly lens, the Panasonic comes with a case and a very useful petal style lens shade.  Olympus should not charge extra for a lens case or a much needed Lens shade for their high end expensive lenses, are you listening Olympus?Best F stop range is 3.5 to 8 for absolute sharp photos from center to corners.  Bokah is very good for the 2.8 f stop range.  No noticable distortion from 24mm to 70mm blown up to 8x10, will try bigger sizes photos down the road but most photos are printed 5x7, and most people print 4x6 anyway.  Very lightweight for an all metal lens with 14 extremely excellent pieces of glass inside and very easy to handle with the larger micro 4/3 cameras and has in-lens IS, which is not needed with the Oly OMD E-5, but yes on other brands. Note it has an on off switch on the lens for the IS.  The lens may ba a little front heavy for the smaller micro 4/3 cameras.I have been into photography as a hobby with my first kodak brownie camera as a young child.Previously 35mm film Nikon F4s (a rather large but excellent camers which I still have) and my Contax G2 were the constant companions.  My favorite combination now is the Panny 12-35mm lens, coupled with the Olympus OMD Digital Camera.  The OMD E-5 is one great little camera that I cannot find much fault with and a carry around always now.  My next lens purchase, once the reviews are all in or if I can borrow it from my photog friend will be the Panasonic 35-100mm f2.8.  Panny, where is this lens, been waiting since the announcement in May??  I think that will be the only other lens I will need for the present time.  Either buy the lens and camera combo (or any of the other micro 4/3 cameras) or rent it to try it out, you will love the light weight and the outstanding performance of the panny - omd combination.UPDATE:  Enlarged some photos to 11x14 and still perfectly clear with no loss of clarity.Tried the Child photo sub-set of 'SCN' function and it worked perfectly, capturing my 2 year old, very active nephew as if he was standing still.  The more I use this lens camera combination the better I like it!  Have not been this excited over a camera lens combo since my beloved Contax G-2.Amazingly 13 people have reviewed this lens and almost all gave it 5 star rating!! UPDATE:  13 reviews now:  score 11 gave 5 star, 2 gave 4 star, perhaps once they have more time with the lens will change to 5 star.The Lens is just super, does what it is supposed to do and although some think it may be pricey, it is cheaper than its DSLR counterparts, lighter and performs just as well.Further update:  Have had the lens and om-d camera for months now and love it as much as my film Contax G-2. Am constantly learning more and more about it via trial and error.  My only two complaints are:  1.  The user manual is nothing more than a very short, un-imaginative and poorly written waste of paper.  There is not even a good instruction telling one to take off certain pieces of the supplied flash in order to attach it to the camera, really no excuse for this.  2:  The Flash is not that great and does not fire all the time, unless I am doing something wrong?  Of course if anyone knows a solution to my dilemma please contact me, would also like to know if anyone knows of a good smallish replacement flash that they have used.Am hoping that David Busch or someone will come out with a very complete substitute user guide/manual that will explain in detail all the features and how to use them properly, especially the flash, or recommendations for a replacement flash that is not bigger than the camera itself.Am also waiting for the just announced (finally), and a little pricy at $1,500 35-100mm Panny lens to be released.  My 12-35 lens came directly from Japan and was a couple of hundred less than here in the states.  WIll probably go the same route for the new lens when available sometime in Dec or Jan. While I like the 12-35 totally, sometimes I want just a little further reach.  Note that the new 35-100 is 3.9 inches in lenght.Other than that the camera lens combo is top notch!Good Luck and Good Shooting.Last Update 12-22-12:  Well since we apparantly made it past the hyped Mayan Doomsday I am here to report that I have tested the 35-100mm Panny lens.  It is superb giving me a reach of 70-200mm and when I put the OMD-5 on the extra built in zoom I get a very clear 140-400mm zoom, absolutely amazing.The new book just out by David Busch on the OMD is also something that should be ordered with the camera lens combination.  As I stated previously the OMD owners manual is nothing but a waste of paper.  Cannot believe that Olympus put out a great camera with the worse owners manual I have ever experienced?Still have not found out much about a flash unit that is smaller than the camera and better than the flash unit that came with it, the only use for the included flash unit is very close up fill in flash.

$REVIEW.: I picked up 16 gigs of this low profile memory as normal hight memory will interfere with myNoctua 6 Dual Heatpipe with 140mm/120mm Dual SSO Bearing Fans CPU Cooler NH-D14 - Retail. It clears it just enough that you can actually remove/replace all 4 memory slots on myGigabyte Intel Z77 Dual Thunderbolt ATX Motherboard with BT4.0/Wi-Fi (GA-Z77X-UP5-TH)without removing the cooler (only the fan). Good thing to know when it is time to switch to 32 gigs.I've had no problems operating these at 1600 MHz. As other reviewers have pointed out, on most BIOS' you need to enable the 1600 MHz mode - which I did. Passed memtest without issue.

It is indeed safely waterproof and the video and photos are of excellent quality.There was no blurring or pixelation when you move the camera quickly while recording. It also works really well in somewhat low lighting (both pics and video). I used it on the beach and in the ocean. It held up great to the sand and the salt.My only complaint is that this sucker is plug-in recharge only. You can not buy a spare battery. This didn't bother me too much since the battery life is pretty good, but ultimately I like to keep a spare on me to change out throughout the day. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd have known that ahead of time - but I would have missed out.This is a superb buy for the price. Compact, high quality and resilient.

$REVIEW.: Well, I have to say that this case is amazing. Here's a list of the goods, bads, and neutrals.GoodsThe 6 120mm fans allows for an insane amount of air flow at low fan speeds, meaning better cooling while staying quiet.It has a bottom mounted PSU, which has to be one of the best features of a computer case.It has a simple thumb-screw assembly for the left and right pannels of the case. This allows for the assembly of the computer to be amazingly easy.I like the huge window on the side. Allows me to see my gear.The rather tall feet on the bottom allow for a lot of air to get to the PSU and the bottom fan. Just don't use it on carpet, unless you want to say good bye to your PSU.The front pannel does not have the power/reset buttons or lights attached to it. The buttons/lights are stationary on the case. It does have the USB and audio pannel connected to it, but the wires are very long.There is a very genius tool used to screw the motherboard stand-off to the case.I used the case-lock eye as a tie down for a lot of cables. Not what it was for, but I like it.The case is really light, but it still feels well built.BadsVery annoying expansion slots. There are pieces of metal that need to be broken off to allow for PCI/e cards. Once they are broken off, there is no way to get them back on.The mother board stand-offs don't mesh with all the holes on my motherboard. There are 3 standoffs that are out on their own. I guess my ATX motherboard is a little bit skinnier than normal.NeutralsThe front 5.25" expansion bays also have the punch-out sheets of metal on them. The only difference that makes this neutral instead of bad is that there are screw holes on these punch-outs that allow for putting them back on the case if needed.The top 2 fans cover the top 2 screw holes on the motherboard. I had to remove the fans to screw the motherboard down the rest of the way. Once the board was in, I put the fans back, no problem.Cable management is... minimal. There is next to no space behind the motherboard, and the space behind the 3.5 inch drives is not very well hidden. I don't mind too much since I don't have a video card to compete with (I went with AMD's APU series, doesn't need a vid card), but some other people might find this a bad.

$review_text.: For an early entry into this still burgeoning technology of consumer 3D cameras.

I was very impressed with the ease of use and quality of the images

The 3D view finder needs to be seen to believed
Everyone that was shown this camera is blown away by it


Have only played with it for a few days.

looking forward to taking some outdoor shots
The 2D image is really no better or worse than any other taken with a camera of this type.

you're essentially getting two average cameras combined into one to achieve a 3D effect with an amazing viewfinder.

Want a high end quality COMPACT 2D CAMERA?.

Consider a LEICA BRAND


This Fuji camera also shoots hi def video


the unit has an HDMI output so you can hook it up directly to a 3D TV, put on your 3D glasses and impress all your friends
Impressive little camera and lots of fun

I have two PSU's that I know for a fact are bad however, this tester showed all lights needed for a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; power supply.This tool should only be used if the computer does not turn on at all (when hooked up to the motherboard) to test the if it is giving any power at all
Of course any computer builder should be able to troubleshoot that issue without this tool completely


If you are getting random restarts to your computer and use this tester on the PSU more then likely it will say its fine.I gave it one star do to the very cheap price and the very limited use it may give me someday, but I doubt I will ever use it again.

$REVIEW.: I had high hopes for these headphones but they really aren't as good as I expected.  They aren't all that comfortable.  I feel a mild and constant pressure on my ears.  I can't wear them for a long time comfortably.  There is a microphone on the cord and a button to pause or move forward or back. They both work well.  The volume control is a slider rather than a toggle switch.  I find it difficult to adjust the volume in small increments.  I either go way too high or too low so I prefer to change the volume on my iPhone.  This is a pain.  Many other headphones use a toggle switch which I can adjust in small increments.  The sound for voice (an audiobook for example) is fine.  For music, I find the sound to be bass heavy and generally kind of muddled.  The sound just never breaks through,  I feel I am getting about 70 or 80% of what I should be getting.  The headphones aren't bad but far from great.  The cord is nice as it is a good length and tangle resistant,  And there is an extra 3.5 mm connector for Nokia, and Samsung and Sony-Ericsson phones.  You don't need the connector for an iPhone.  The headphones fit the iPhone out of the box.  With some mild improvement, these could be really good.  I hope Philips refines them.

$REVIEW.: I'll admit i'm not a fan of big-screens, i think the bigger the screen the more imperfections you can see. This assuming that you don't really need a big screen(which i really don't). There's a lot of ghost images, choppy images... I'm also not adjusted to high def either so it's possible i'm just not ready for this type of TV.Anyway, i think if you NEED a 60 inch get it.. if not really think about it... watching the baseball game from an SD network. it's like watching a 1980's video game all the square edges.And the base doesn't come installed, not sure if this is standard with this size tv or not. It only took about 5 minutes to put the base on thou, and if you have little kids be careful it's a very shaky base. And no way,that i've noticed, to tether it to the wall like my previous 42 inch did.And don't forget to order some 3d glasses to , they don't even come with 1 pair.

$REVIEW.: I just received my Cisco Linksys E4200 wireless router and I am very impressed! I'm about as non-technical a person as you'll find when it comes to hooking up this kind of device, and I was a bit intimidated about tackling the project. I should not have worried at all!The router comes with an easy, 3 step installation process tailor made for people just like me. I put the CD in my drive, followed the instructions, and in about 15 minutes my home was completely saturated with Wi-Fi coverage. It really could not have been any easier. My home includes two Macs, two PC's, a Kindle and a Wii home entertainment system - all are synced and working beautifully. I was a bit concerned since one of my PC's did not have a Wireless card, but there are four auxiliary jacks on the back of the router to accommodate the existing cables, so hookup was not an issue at all.As for the speed, I have noticed a marked improvement in the speed of my internet connection. I can't quantify how much faster, (as I said, I'm not techy) but it appears to work with much better speed.Reception: My house is centrally located on approximately 1 acre of land, and I am able to receive four or five bars (a very strong signal) anywhere in my house. I get about 2 bars of signal anywhere on my property, (which is all I can get on my Kindle in my local Wi-Fi hotspots around town.) I have not traveled beyond that point to test it's ultimate range, but I would guess it is 80 to 100 yards in any direction. If your home is bigger than that, I suspect you're not self installing a router anyhow.I am very pleased with this product and recommend it highly!

I like it

A lot
It has nice graphics, and the supplied windshield mount worked well for me


They have made many improvements to the map and firmware updating software since I first started using it

I like the voice direction feature, and it has a good catalog of places installed, although I have found a store or two that weren't included
I also like the selection of extra vehicle icons, and my favorite is the bird, who flaps his wings when you are driving

I also like the speed limit display

$REVIEW.: This camera is cheap but it has a good picture quality if you can keep it from going to video loss. It does this quite easily and can be fixed by cupping your hand over the lens but that is a hassle in the middle of the night.I'll be returning the two I bought. Also the packaging is a nightmare. You need 2 small men and a boy to get if out of the package. Why, when it come to my house?Q-See QSOCWC Weatherproof CMOS Camera w/Night Vision (Color)

$REVIEW.: I purchased this warranty in order to protect my Sony Bloggie 3D purchase. Within a year of purchase, my camera started misbehaving, and I contacted the warranty system. Unfortunately, they said I had to first try to use my factory warranty service, and my claim was denied. Then, a year later, my camera finally started becoming unusable and I filed another claim. This time, the process was pretty quick, they sent me a shipping label, and received my product at their service center to attempt repair. Within a few days I received notification that repairing my camera would not be possible and they were going to reimburse the purchase amount. They did so through an amazon gift card that was I able to redeem and use for the purchase of a brand new camera. I was so pleased with the service, that I bought a new warranty with the new camera.

$review_text.: These are some very impressive headphones

The sound is incredible &amp;#8211; full, natural separation; clear tonality throughout the full range; clean bass that properly complements the sound without being muddy or overbearing


Truly some of the best sound I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard out of a set of headphones, even ones that cost three and four times as much as these.The key word when describing the sound is natural


No, you won&amp;#8217;t get booming bass that drowns everything out and rattles your eyeballs


What you will get is music that sounds as close to what the musician created as you can get short of a live performance.The headphones are very elegant looking


The ear cups are clad in a gray-toned metal with a brushed finish


It looks nicely understated and modern


The ear cups are cushy and comfortable


The &amp;#8216;phones come with an extra set of ear pads, which is a nice touch


The cups totally surround your ear providing excellent sound isolation
You won&amp;#8217;t hear any ambient noise with these on.The headband is well padded and comfortable

My only comfort quibble is that they grip my head pretty tightly

Not painful tight, but tighter than I normally prefer
But, since these are ear surround headphones, a tighter than normal grip does have some benefits.The headphones use a Y cable, with inputs on each ear cup
The set comes with 2 cords &amp;#8211; one with a 3.5mm jack; one with a standard 1/4 inch jack.They come in a very nice hard case (that is also available separately)

The case is excellent &amp;#8211; very high quality materials (including a zipper that works very well) combined with practicality

My favorite feature of the case is that it has a zippered pouch that holds an ample number of cables
The pouch has Velcro on it, so it can be removed entirely from the case


Plus, it can be positioned anywhere on the inside of the case

Someone was actually thinking when they designed the case, rather than have it be an afterthought.These are undoubtedly the best value in a high-end headphone I've ever come across

The sound is nothing short of spectacular &amp;#8211; far beyond what you might think you&amp;#8217;d get at this price point
Spending more will get you some nicer materials (such as real leather and wood accents), but you won&amp;#8217;t get better sound unless you spend a WHOLE lot more


Huge recommendation![Sample provided for review]

$REVIEW.: -----------------------------------------Updated on May 20:This one went dead very soon. I used it while jogging, that's it and it's dead now. I sweat a lot so that could be the reason....so guys who sweat while jogging dont buy this...I will update on the customer service later..-----------------------------------------I did enough research and finally decided to go for this. I like it very much; this review is based on the usage for 2 weeks so far. I will try to post updates if I find anything good or bad about this in the future.I am enjoying this player so far. I use it everyday in the gym. I do jogging and it is really apt for me (Thanks to the armband). The sound effect is really cool. The ear phones are great and never fall out of my ears while jogging. It comes with 3 different sizes of ear buds so I hope it can fit in all ear. The navigations are simple and easy. The sound control wheel is bit let down but I don't find it annoying at all. The expandable memory slot is really helpful for me as I already have a 1 GB SD card from my PDA. One problem with this player is if you switch off the player and switch it on, it plays from the beginning of the last track played (It's not smart enough to bookmark the exact spot on the track) So if you are listening any audio stories, you may have to fast forward every time you reset the player.Overall, I am completely satisfied with the player so far! I would recommend this!

It took nearly 2 hours to format in Windows to NTFS, but I've heard that's typical for Windows and it now runs fast and quiet (so far). Some older Seagate drives have known firmware issues, so Seagate's website allows you to enter the drive's serial number to confirm the firmware and get a firmware bios-flash update if needed. The drive I received was new enough not to need any upgrade. I've only given it 4 stars for reliability due to the fact that I've only used it for a month as of this post. There was no SATA cable or installation CD and the packaging was sparse, but I've ordered "bulk" drives from Amazon before so I knew what to expect and I'm not complaining about it.

$review_text.: I ordered this tv to replace a 20 year old one that I was playing xbox on. I love it not just for the gaming but the other features also. the sd card reader and the ipod dock are a great couple of add ons for a tv. its very easy to use and the menus are very user friendly. I ordered it from abt electronics and received it in 4 days. The picture is excellent. I just had to tone down the picture a little while gaming cause it was a little too sharp. but the adjustments were easy to do. I recommend it to anyone.

$REVIEW.: The asymmetric shape of this camera bag allows easy carrying.  There is a zipper for expansion and an internal softshaped organizational form is flexible with some velcro and divides the space for lenses and other equipment.  Other items can be placed in the camera bag when the expansion zipper is open.  The bag appears to be water resistant and protects equipment from unexpected downpours also.

$review_text.: If you're looking for the one sentence review: this receiver is absolutely amazing.  Now I'll tell you why:HDMI OSD: I use a projector, which leaves the receiver sitting about 10 feet behind me.  OSD lets me see what the volume level is without turning around and squinting.  Furthermore, browsing the menus on the receiver is so much more pleasant with the OSD.Network connectivity: I thought this would be a gimmick, but it is NOT.  One thing that is odd to me is that it's only wired internet.  But I have a mac mini hooked up to the projector anyway, so I'm using its Internet Sharing feature to get network connectivity to the TX-NR609.  I've been listening to Pandora radio so much since I got this receiver.  I love that the song info is shown on the receiver, and also the OSD.  Sure, I could have fired it up on the mac mini, but it's a pain to manage a keyboard and mouse compared to having it all controllable from the receiver remote.  I find that I'm using and will use this feature a ton.  Another AWESOME side effect of this is the ability to upgrade the firmware over the internet.  I've done this once already and it was painless.HDMI:  The functionality of this receiver is great when it comes to HDMI.  Plug in whatever you want: composite, component, hdmi, and it all goes out to the display via HDMI.  This means I only have to run one wire to the projector.  It's such a great use of technology and I love it.  Onkyo did a fantastic job with this.  There are many options for controlling the output/upscaling in the setup menus too.  And again, OSD makes these a breeze.I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no problems with the sound this thing pushes out.  I have 2 floor tower speakers and a modest center channel.  They all sound great.For the cons: the OSD could use some improving.  It's slightly sluggish.  Especially for the network menus.. there is some weirdness.  I find that sometimes I can enter the setup menu from NET and sometimes I cannot, and I generally cannot move around the setup menu when I do.  Same with the HOME menu.  This can all be fixed in a firmware update I'm pretty sure.  And it's not the biggest deal in the world.  The receiver works great in general and as long as you are mindful of these few small things, you can keep the experience completely positive.In closing, please continue to innovate the home stereo receiver, Onkyo!
$review_summary.: Onkyo maintains awesomeness with the TX-NR609

$review_text.: I bought the Nexus 7 direct from Google when it went on sale in July of this year. It's an absolute great value at $199. The $249 asking price was viewed as suspect even back then because it's a $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage. Just for the sake of comparison a 8GB SD card can costs as little as $5 and change. Even the more pricey cards I've seen weren't more than $14. But still, the N7 is a 7 inch quadcore Tegra3, 720p tablet that ships with Jellybean (Android 4.1) and gets first-in-line support direct from Google...for $199 - $249. It's a sexy proposition even with the newly announced iPad Mini. Summary...The positives -- Runs the latest stock Android with support direct from Google- Supports full customization and apps that Android allows with no UI skin and no excuses.- Incredible value for the price between $199 - $249- 720p HD screen- 7 inch form factor is very convenient- Runs smooth- Good battery life (over 9 hours)The negatives -- There's no microSD (mSD) card slot- $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage- Build quality is suspect with many units. There's issues with the left side of the screen coming a bit loose from the housing.- There's no MHL support to go HDMI out from the N7 to a receiver or HDTV. (see Nexus Q for the reasons why)- Google is going to announce a 32GB Nexus 7 for $249 in a few days, effectively burning anyone that bought the $249 16GB N7 3 months ago.Final word - There is a lesson that many people must keep in mind when using Android. If you can help it all at, only buy non carrier branded Nexus devices. This is to guarantee that you get first in line support direct from Google for at least 18 months, it also guarantees that you will get a pure Android device without any UI skins, carrier bloatware (apps) or modifications included. The Nexus 7 is a great device that suffers from the lack of expandable storage and shipping with only 16GBs max (currently, this will change very soon). It also suffers from build issues resulting in some devices that creaks on the left side of the screen. Because of this, it's not a 5* device even for the phenomenal price. But it is hands down one of the best tablets you can buy at this form factor, not just the best Android tablet. Although the Nook Tablet is excellent and the Kindle HD Fire deserves a nod, the problem with these devices is that they run a skinned (read: not pure) version of Android. There are key features these devices will simply not have that the N7 does. Examples being, Google Play access, Google sync, Google apps, Google support. Support for these devices are suspect at best But the N7 can still support Barnes and Noble and Kindle features through their apps.Close to perfect but not quite. Still the N7 is the tablet to beat for the price.

$REVIEW.: I used this RAM in my 2009 Macbook 2.26 (white unibody) and while Apple says that this computer will only handle 4GB of RAM, it accepts 8GB just like the 2.26 Macbook Pro version. Noticeable decreases in boot time,  can have multiple apps running without much lag, and I haven't had nearly as many spinning beach balls. Overall, my macbook just seems smoother, especially on Lion (gestures have an immediate response now). Go ahead an upgrade. Well worth it!

I lecture three classes one day a week; the projector runs for five hours on that day.  This projector is everything I had hoped for and more.  It is very bright (I do not dim the lights).  I use the projector at about a five foot distance from the wall.  The display is very bright and large.  At this point, I have nothing negative to say about this projector.  It is small enough to carry back and forth to class, yet heavy enough to not move around while I walk and talk with my iPad. Which brings me to the last point that it works seamlessly with the iPad/VGA adapter.  This can be picked up at the Apple store.I use Notability on my iPad 2 for displaying lectures as I write.  Also, the fan is not noisy in my opinion at all on this projector.The projector also works at home for displaying outdoor movies for fun.

$REVIEW.: Got one of these for a 32 inch HDTV that I wanted to connect a separate VCR and DVD Player to, and also from time to time a laptop computer (the HDTV works as a computer monitor also) and video games for the kids. Basically the unit does what the ad says. It has 4 sets of INPUT jacks (RCA and S Video), 3 sets on the back and 1 set on the front, and 1 set of OUTPUT jacks (also RCA and S Video). Wired it up and it works fine with one minor (to me) exception, and that is I cannot get the MODE to change (the MODE button is supposed to let you manually select the input for the TV, or set it on automatic, or set it on scan). Mine came already set to automatic and it works fine, but I would just like the option of setting it to manual. 4 stars. Would buy again if needed.

Connected 2 Kensington Universal Multi-display Adapters to my USB hub and it worked like a charm! Very easy setup! Yes, with the included base the monitors do tilt downward and can't really be adjusted. But to get around this (and also make more room in my workspace) I also purchased a dual monitor desk-mount stand, ( theMonoprice 3-Way Adjustable Tilting DUAL Desk Mount Bracket for LCD LED (Max 33Lbs, 10~23inch) - Black).

$review_text.: I still have to master the zoom functions, but my overall impression is positive. For Skype and other conference uses, it does the job well and is worth the few extra dollars over lesser models.The built-in stand results in the camera being placed on a table and producing those unflattering up-the-nostrils views. Mounting it higher produces a more flattering view but draping it over the top of the monitor may not work on some montors. Taping it to the monitor back is more secure.\As always, kudos to Amazon. After dealing with some other online companies, the Amazon commitment to customer satisfaction continues to be the gold standard of online retail business.

$review_text.: As a professional, I have realistic expectations when it comes to equipment, that's why I named my review accordingly. Generally speaking photo hardware like stands under $150 tends to be suspect. Since I am a mobile and work on location mostly I expect my equipment to take a beating. For the price of $65 shipped, I consider this boom stand good value. It probably won't hold up like another brand name so I know I'll have to be more gentle/The hardware for tightening are plastic so I have to be sure not to put too much weight on the boom. It should probably work ok for one Speedlite and a light modifier. I wouldn't mount a studio flash on this boom. If I did, I would make sure an assistant is stand right next to this boom.I might update this review after a few months of use but I'm not too disappointed with this boom.

$review_text.: My old Linksys WRT54GS finally died after maybe 8 years of faithful service so I bought this one.  Here are my simple observations:1. The Cox online automatic setup does not work.  I got a Cox technician on the phone and within 15 minutes was up and running.  The Zoom 5352 is on their approved list.2. This is a combined modem/wifi.  I really like it for that reason.  Really, in this day and age I'm surprised this isn't yet the norm.  It looks nice too.3. Range is very good.  HD Netflix streaming to the living room and far master bedroom is no problem at all.  Buffer load times are faster now.4. My upload speed more than doubled from 5mbs to 12mbs using this new/updated modem.  It probably could go faster but this is the service tier I pay for.  I get 30+ download speed and 15ms ping here.Now for some negatives:5. The power cord is 5' or less.  It can be too short if you have it on a bookshelf.  I had to put my battery UPS on a pedestal in order to reach the shelf the modem is on.  What a stupid thing to cheap out on.  That extra few feet of cord length is very useful if you need it.6. The biggest negative for me is DNS configurability.  If you use an alternate DNS server like Google DNS or OpenDNS...this modem/router will NOT work.  I researched this issue, found no solution. If you've never heard of OpenDNS - check it out.  It's a great way to filter out all the porn/adult web sites automatically that you don't want your 6 yr old getting into.  Another advantage can be better speeds and incredible reliability with no downtime.7. The firmware cannot be flashed.  If you're a DD-WRT fan forget it.  I never bothered flashing my old router but some folks love to tinker.Install tip:Have the S/N and CM MAC # ready when you call the ISP for the install.  No need to flip the unit over - there is an identical sticker right on the box.I give this unit 5 stars for doing it's mission and 4 stars for overall configurability.

I am not switching to any other headphones after trying these. If I had the money, I would buy a couple extra ones just because these are so awesome. Money well spent!

I will never again buy routers with internal antenna.  This puppy has such a good radio signal all around the house that we no longer need repeaters.  The phone &amp; tablet both of which used to take a bit to pick up Wi-Fi when in the back of the house or basement (even with the repeaters) now immediately grab the wireless signal.  Barely any lag time.The download/upload speeds have improved as well.  That is probably due the fact that our repeaters were not fancy ones with two radios  - one radio to retrieve the broadcast signal from the Access Point &amp; another radio to broadcast it out.  With only one radio (as ours have) your repeater has to do double duty, both retrieve &amp; send the broadcast signal from the AP which effectively cuts your bandwidth in half.  Thus we have faster speeds.
$review_summary.: Simple, fast, strong radio signal &amp; looks pretty wicked - what could be better?

It does what it says, that is true, but there are major drawbacks which undermine its real usability. First of all, if you have a PS3, this item is completely useless. The reason for that is you can stream video content to your PS3 and hence to your television and the quality is much much better. The video quality is a major concern here: even using their dedicated video player, unless you have a 720p high quality video, the output will be mediocre (at least on a 55', using HDMI connection). I tried several H.264 videos (640x360) and there is an incredible degrading in output quality if compared to the direct streaming to PS3 using a media server (but you can always just plug an external USB hard-drive to the PS3 if you don't want to stream). Only with 720p video, the difference is not very noticeable. Audio, on the other side, is great, and there is no audible difference between the player and PS3 streaming. Another disappointing issue is that even if you can stream your desktop content, the CPU utilization is unacceptable, roughly 70% on both my P3750@2GHz cores. This might be a less annoying problem if you have a very fast machine, but still I would have expected less usage. If you plan to use your television as a second monitor, forget about it: as explained in the manual, there is a 2-3 seconds delay and also your mouse pointer is not shown on the television. The real use I do of this is to stream internet videos directly to my television. To conclude this is useful in my opinion ONLY if you have high quality videos and you don't have a PS3 attached to your television or you just want to stream internet content.

$review_text.: I bought a &amp;#34;Like New&amp;#34; unit from warehouse deals, so I might have received a lemon, but I had some quality issues with mine.  There are multiple levels on the head, but at least on the one I got, none of the levels agreed with each other, nor did they actually indicate true level (compared with a separate spirit level).  Whoever glued the bubble levels onto mine must have been asleep or drunk.  I also found that one of the legs was longer than the other 2; I don't know how this could happen, perhaps something to do with the assembly of the legs.For what you pay for this tripod &amp; head, you get a lot of nice features.  There's a lot of metal used in the construction of both the legs and head, so it feels substantial, but the quality of the metal and overall feel is a notch below brand names - it lacks the fine finish you find on most photographic equipment.  It feels more like something you'd buy at Harbor Freight Tools, if you're familiar with that store.  Some parts are designed well, others not - for example, the legs hit up against the center tube when folded up, and will eventually leave scrape marks.  Obviously the manufacturer realized this, as they ship it with some bubble wrap around the center tube to prevent scratches during shipping.I think you might like it for about </review_text><review_summary>Good</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3J74MTN0SOL0J"><latest_review_date>16/04/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00C4Q61Z6</product_id><review_date>16/04/2012</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>Without this device you cant use the full player cant watch Youtube, or netflix!

$REVIEW.: I was reading all the negative reviews and bought this anyway.  I think maybe this company has updated this product and I have the newer version  It fits perfectly on my iPad 3.  Snapped right on nice and snug.  When you hold the iPad by the edge it does not come off.  I like that it locks in my leather smart cover magnet perfectly and matches well.  The magnet is strong on the apple smart cover but I have found it does moe around and come off, so this iblason locking inn the magnet is a nice feature.  The space around the dock connector is more than large enough for the charging connector AND both camera connectors.  Before I got this I had had ghost armor applied which was a real waste of money.  Finally ripped the ghost armor off the screen as it was coming off around the edges and I wasn't going to waste more money getting it reapplied. But left it on the back even though it was bubbling.  This case seems to fit right over the ghost armor on the back no problem, so I guess the ghost armor may at least protect the back of this case slides a little.  I read lots of the reviews of this product about cracking.  The material mine is made of seems quite flexible and forgiving.  Will have to see if it cracks.  For right now I love it.  I really like my leather smart cover even though apple has it way over priced.  But now with this case I can use the smart cover but also protect the back.  And the gray color matches my blue smart cover very well...  Please remember, this is just a back protector.  One reviewer was very mad that it did not come with the smart cover.  But it clearly says the smart cover is not included.  One closing thought.  If iblason wanted to improve this product they would add a magnetic strip that would hold the smart cover open.  Only downfall, although not really a major one.  Great back cover for the price.  I'm quite pleased.Update November.  Yup. Just like others said.  It cracked right at he corner.  Started with a little crack.  Then a whole piece of the corner fell off.  I'm going to try and call company and see if they will replace.

$REVIEW.: Or do you just have better uses for your time?  In either case this little gadget can  save you a lot of time, trouble, and headaches (literally, from banging your head while crawling around underneath your desk) by securing the ends of disconnected cables and wires on top of your desk where they belong rather than letting them slip down behind.  So long as the wire end connector is at least a quarter inch around, there is no danger of it pulling through.  (Thinner end connectors can be secured by pinching them between the loops a little bit higher in the slots.)  Even a coaxial cable with connector can be secured by running it through the hole in the side of the loops.Defects?  Well, as other reviewers have noted, it is a little light.  Hook up a bunch of heavier wires and cables, and you risk having it pulled down behind your desk by the sheer weight of the wires themselves.  If you expect to be using it in that way, you may prefer the heavier, more expensive model:Quirky Metal Cordies Desktop Cable Management for power cords and charging accessory cables.

I leave mine plugged in constantly, but if you need to use it on multiple computers, you can tuck the USB connector into the mouse (in with the battery).The scroll wheel works well and the tilt-clicks default to back/forward for web-browsing. It has a battery life indicator on the top so it is easy to see when the battery is getting low, plus an on/off switch on the bottom to help save battery life.Strongly recommended!

My fitness app (Digifit) interfaces with my heart rate monitor (60beat) and iTunes, so these earphones tell me when I'm running too slowly or quickly; also, they let me click back or forward between audio tracks. There's a volume control, too.The battery life is good&amp;#8211; two hours at least &amp;#8211; and there is rarely any of the clicking or popping that one associates with Bluetooth earpieces, even when the heart rate monitor, which is also Bluetooth, is operating.

$REVIEW.: This is a nicely laid out case with a good cable routing system and easy drive install and removal. As supplied, there is a lot of cooling and room to work on and install components and aesthetically it is a notch above most. The mechanical parts are sturdy, quiet with three fans running and modular in construction.Instructions for inexperienced assemblers are not good, particularly when making panel and other electrical connections to a mother board. As an example, there is a fan control switch with a power connection and four fan connections. No instructions. The four fan connections are only required if fans are added to the case as the existing fans are already wired. There are no instructions regarding wiring power, reset, etc. and mother boards only provide pin identification, but not connector orientation.

$REVIEW.: My son has an ipod 5 that didn't have a case - pretty dangerous for a 10-year old

 He loves this lego case - it's a functional lego toy, and he can build legos on top of the back of it, but it's also a rugged enough case to stand up to day-to-day usage by a sometimes absent-minded little boy

 Definitely recommend for younger children.

Very annoying


This is the only bluetooth mouse that stay connected.Plus, the multitouch surface is like a charm, good job, Apple!Con: the flat design could be unconformable for gripping in the beginning, takes a while to get used to it.

$review_text.: Note that this records in mp4 format. The video is fairly clear, in normal lighting. It has a macro mode that goes from 1 cm, and ISO up to 3200, with the usual caveats about noise. No 16:9 format, though.Sleek-looking and waterproof to five feet, it's sleekness and waterproofness has probably contributed to its couple of shortcomings, both in the usability department.First, in the name of waterproofing, the battery, memory and AV connection are locked behind a slim door under the control pad. This means when the door is open to accomodate the AV cable, it's hard to use the already mushy control pad - its hinge is just under the pad, so the open door gets in the way of the pad.The pad itself must be made of some rubbery membrane underneath, because, as mentioned, it feels loose and mushy, both the selection button and the directional pad around it.It has 5x optical zoom, and supposedly face detection to boost its anti-shake. However, at zoom, some jitteriness is still noticeable. The sound is pretty good, at least from recording our band practice.Its menus are easy enough to navigate. Battery life is iffy, don't expect more than about an hour's worth for video.The case is a weird, tight-fitting, half-open design, and there is no lens cover. I suppose since it's waterproof, the lens must be ruggedized anyway.

$review_text.: For my review I compared between the Jabra Solemate and the Transit and the differences are:1) The Solemate has much better low range than does the Transit. The Jabra has got three speakers, two tweeters and a sub woofer versus only two in the Transit.2) The Solemate can be connected wired or wirelessly via Bluetooth, USB cable or 3.5 mm audio cable located in the Solemate, while the transit can only be connected either Bluetooth or wired.3) Also the Solemate can be charged either USB while connected to the USB port on the PC, versus the Transit requiring a separate charge cable and the use of the 3.5 mm audio cable, which means that the Jabra Solemate actually while connected to a PC plays digitally versus analog.4) Another difference is that the Solemate comes with a protective bag to protect it while outdoors.  Protects it from the elements (sand at the beach etc.)  It also sounds the same with the bag covering it.For the money right now Amazon is selling the JABRA Solemate for </review_text><review_summary>My MS Track Ball Explorer only lasted 13 years!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3JXR3KRNFANVO"><latest_review_date>26/06/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B006QB1RPY</product_id><review_date>26/06/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>simple easy to use old fashion buttons (instead of touch screen good old solid buttons ) best mp3 I have ever had my dad handed it down to me its becoming a heirloom lasted for all these years being dropped down stairs onto tile been hit by viruses its been with me everywhere its even been caught on fire and its still my main source of music 21 years old I do not feel embarrassed carrying around such a large mp3 it will always be the best mp3 to me to bad creative zen doesn't make mp3s like this anymore.I am rarely pleased with any product I have never given a 5 star for anything I bought but this mp3 deserves it.

$REVIEW.: I tried out this one (WR-111B) and another model (the WR-333) and both are good, basic emergency radios.  The only technical difference I noticed is that the 333 has room for AAA batteries as an alternate power source.  This is probably unnecessary most of the time but if you're worried about the rechargeable battery for some reason, then you can have a backup that way.  The 333 is also bigger and has a clip on the top for hanging it up whereas the 111B has a lanyard.Both feature a small solar panel on the top to help keep the battery charged (I leave it sitting on a window sill) but there's also a hand crank.  There's a flashlight (triple LED), an AM/FM radio that can also pick up emergency weather frequencies (e.g. 162.550 MHz).  If you leave it plugged in, it can be set to automatically turn on when there's a weather alert (it says you can do this without plugging it in but it drains the battery fast).It also features an ability to plug in a cell phone.  Note that the battery on these things is fairly small -- your smart phone holds more of a charge -- so it's not going to fill up your phone.  What it CAN do, though, is give your phone enough juice to run for a few minutes which might be enough to help you out in an emergency (I imagine if you were dedicated enough you could charge your phone, crank the battery back up and then charge your phone again if you wanted more juice right away).The speaker is about what you'd expect from these radios -- weak and tinny.  But there's a stereo out jack and it sounds fine through my earphones.

$review_text.: Let me start off by saying I had to return the product because it did not fit my vehicle. I drive an 03 Impala. Impalas 00'-05 have a large dashboard lip just above the stereo. so where this will technically fit in the double-din slot, it wont function properly as it prevents the screen from extending to an angle that is reasonable. It was tilted down towards the cup holder.Luckily, unlike some other customers, all of my equipment arrived in great condition. It wired up just fine, although took a little longer than the more popular brands of stereos. Keep in mind you'll need to purchase the appropriate wiring harness for your car as well as any safety adapters.For this price range, you cant really do much better, But throwing a few more dollars at a piece of equipment you will be using for quite sometime is totally worth it.

$review_text.: The trim ring feels a bit flimsy. I've had it in for a week and it seems good. It was straight forward to install. There are a bunch of tabs around it to mate up with different vehicles, and you have to cut of the ones that don't belong there for your application. A dremel tool with a cut off wheel would be handy. I managed with a  hack saw and being careful.The 1.5 DIN space is a pain to deal with. I like the small pocket space better than the alternative which is a flat piece of plastic that centers the 1 DIN radio in the middle. The small crevice is good for stuffing a map, directions, or the cord to your mp3 player.I'd prefer it was built a little stronger, but it was the best option out there for a Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ, and I'm happy with it so far.

Very easy to use, even for a 12 year old! Within minutes she was trying all of the features which were easy to figure out. Well made camera, which is typical for Nikon. The deep blue color is very "rich" looking.

In my opinion, there are too many cons to make this worth you money at the moment. For instance, you can only use this on a laptop. No exceptions. I have tried this on 3 desktops, 1 Mac and two PCs, and all have failed to work.Another major problem is the range is extremely short, reaching about 15 feet. At that range you would be better off buying a $10 HDMI cable the reaches just as far! Also the receiver has to be in sight of the dock, which means you can't have your laptop in another room, charging or hooked up to the internet, while streaming your media. Also, this Veebeam only streams music, videos, and displays websites (with an annoying 1-2 second lag). It does not stream games, or .exe programs which I assumed would work, seeing as it does everything else...  That lack of a feature really renders this useless for gamers or anyone who would like to use this as a secondary display (not mentioning the lag.)Furthermore, in the description it says, and I quote "When you're ready to watch a movie, plug the USB antenna into your laptop and stream anything directly to your TV. It's that simple." That is not the case. You have to go to their website and download an application that is always running in the background of your computer which adds another tab every time you right click on a media file. Besides it being annoying, (I like the minimal amount of tabs/windows open as possible) it also, to some extent, drains your laptop's battery and hardware resources.

$REVIEW.: I am disappointed with this purchase...
I guess it's my own fault but I searched specifically for Lightscribe cd's and this Verbatim package was listed within these search parameters


Not sure if I'm going to keep or return them


 I guess from now on I'll have to double-check each item before ordering

 This is the first Amazon purchase I've made in 3 years that I have been disappointed with.

$REVIEW.: These 'phones ROCK!!!!!!I previously owned a pair of the Shure E4c's --- before that, I went in between Bose QC2's, Bang &amp; Olafson A8's, and Sony MDRNC50'sFirst off, I prefer my ShureBuds over the Sony MDR, Bang &amp; Olafson A8, and DEFINITELY over the Bose QC2 &amp; QC3 ---- so if you're looking for confirmation that ShureBuds are better than the others mentioned, then you can confirm it with me now - they areWith that said, I'm going to focus this review on a comparison between the E500's vs the E4c's ---- I'll address the other headphones a little more towards the endI don't use headphones while exercising --- I do a lot of writing, and most of my writing happens on a laptop in coffeeshops and cafes --- thus, I usually wear my headphones while writing, so that I can listen to my tunes and drown out the outside noises ---- I also do a TON of travelling, as I'm taking airplane rides every 2 to 3 weeks, so 'phones are real important here ---- with that said, I need my headphones to be portable, of excellent sound quality, able to block out outside noises, and also flexible enough to allow me to hear the 'outside' world when neededOkay, my reasons for preferring the E500's over the E4c's1. SOUND ---- of course, sound should be the TOP factor of any, and it is in this case --- the sound quality of the E500's is definitely superior and that is mostly because the fidelty is of a higher quality than the E4c's and the bass is more prevalent (but not overly prevalent) --- many headphones (particularly Bose ones) put the bass way too loud in order to compensate for lousy fidelty --- this is where SHURE buds shine, because they don't max out the bass, and instead, give the fidely enough richness to get the song by at its truest quality ---- however, the E4c's in some ways seem to have too little bass, which causes many of the songs to come out too scratchy, with crisp treble but not enough bass ---- with that said, the E500's strike an excellent balance of appropriate bass, with excellent fidelty and treble ---- aside from the increase in bass though, the regular fidelty is of a much higher quality within the E500's --- don't get me wrong ---- the E4c's are great, but there is a big difference in sound quality with the E500's2. COMFORT ---- I am huge on comfort --- while I don't mind the E4c's fit, I could always tell that there was a bud in my ears, no matter what tip-ending I would place upon the buds ---- in addition, I found that the E4c's commonly slipped out of my ears, again, no matter the tip-ending ---- the E500's, on the other hand, are shaped much differently than the E4c's and it is a wonderful change!!! The E500's are a much more comfortable fit, often making me feel that there really isn't anything in my ear --- in addition, they never slip out of my ear (depending on the bud tip that you use) --- so the fit and the comfort here is much better3. SEAL ---- the seal is the buds ability to stay in one's ear, creating a noise seal, not allowing outside sounds to come in, for the purpose of keeping the music good ---- the seal of the E500 is much better than the E4c's, again, because of the comfort ---- the E500's fit much better upon a person's ear and stay there, without one having to stick the buds deep inside one's ear ---- in addition, creating a seal with the E500 is very easy --- I've been taking them on and off with ease, without worrying about getting another good seal, unlike the E4c's, which I dreaded having to take off and often spent too much time finding a good seal with4. PUSH TO HEAR FEATURE ---- I LOVE THIS FEATURE --- a lot of people are complaining about it, but I think its great! ----- the 'phones come with a plastic 'thingy' that, when turned on, reduce the sound of the headphones and instead microphone the sounds taking place outside of your headphones --- so for example, a person coming to talk to you will now be heard, as if, they are talking into a microphone near your headphones, allowing you to respond from there --- overall, this feature allows one to keep the buds in your ears, and turn the music off with ease, in order to hear what's going around you --- I think its a terrific feature overall5. ACCESSORIES ---- I love the accessories and the flexibilities of these headphones --- you can detach the 'buds from the PTH microphone, and hook them up directly to one's iPod ---- or you can add a cord lengthener, etc ---- my fav accessory is a cord base that allows for one to increase the volume of the buds, without having to touch the iPod controls ---- in addition, all cord accessories are gold plated, keeping the sound solid all around --- lastly, the 'phones come with a great carry case, that keeps everything together in a small packageOTHER HEADPHONES -----As mentioned above, I prefer the Shure E500PTH over the Bose QC2, Bose QC3, Sony MDRNC50, and the Bang &amp; Olafson A8I find that the Bose QC2 and Bose QC3 pump up the bass WAY TOO MUCH, not allowing for the song's true fidelty to come throughI actually like the SONYMDRNC50's a lot, especially the 'monitor' button that acts a lot like the Shure's PTH features ---- however, I find the Shure buds to have a superior sound quality over the Sony MDR's and I also prefer the smaller sizeLastly, the Bang &amp; Olafson A8's are a GREAT pair of headphones, but they do not provide any kind of seal within one's ear --- it comprimeses the sound for me too much, in this case, however they are a great set of 'phonesPRICE -----Price is a BIG factor --- yeah, it seems ridiculous to purchase headphones that cost more than an iPod, but if sound is important and you can afford the costs, then I DEFINITELY recommend splurging on the good soundIf you have the budget to purchase the E4c's, then I say pony up the extra money to go with the E500's ---- the phones are of excellent build, can take a lot of abuse and will last forever --- splurge now and be happy for years! Unlike computers, headphone technology is not updated constantly --- thus, these headphones can be used for a loooooooong time!!!CONCLUSION ----I think the E500's are an excellent purchase ---- I'm big on sound and I'll be attaching these suckers to my hip, ready to listen to my iPod at any time --- if you got the budget and tunes are important, then these are YOUR 'phones!!!HAPPY BUYING ---- may peace and love be upon you all!!!!!

$REVIEW.: PROS:-build quality-no noise distortion-better buttons than the apple headphonesCONS:-no microphone-questionable futureI bought this to replace the iPod headphones that I threw away when I got my iPod.  This product serves it's purpose, and I don;t hear an additional decrease in sound quality.  I have had mine for four months so far without any problems.  I do not take good care of my electronics, and I see how this will certainly eventually rip at the seams, but for the time being it is a sturdy device, and a good price.  I use mine on my iPod touch (the side buttons died) and the only thing I was disappointing by was the fact that there is no microphone, although, it states this in the description.

$review_text.: So, I upgraded my Rip with a Sync


As an after thought, I decided to also get this Jot - without first reading the reviews
This is a One-Trick Pony


It does not save anything, i.e
one page only


It is not rechargeable


When the battery runs out, you have to throw it away


And you can not link it to your Smartphone, Tablet, nor Laptop


Once you use the One Page, you erase it and start again
I thought I could use this to replace my Rhodia, but not quite
It does take your note

The screen is like the Sync in that it takes awhile for it to &amp;#34;warm up&amp;#34; to being written on; the contrast is lacking from the Rip

Still a good product, just not the product you think it is.

I set volume gain to just under 1/2 way up, it sounds good there without being too boomy.Be careful not to overlap a nearby commercial station as it will easily overpower any station within your neighborhood, and that's probably illegal.  Also be aware that this device can tune outside the US FM band, including the aircraft band.  Going above 108MHz is a good way to get in big trouble, so I recommend you don't do that.

$REVIEW.: These batteries are as the originals that shipped with the camera.  Most of the current Panasonic cameras are deisned to only use proprietary batteries.  These have great energy storage &amp; could be a 'make or break' if you deplete your battery and have the need to continue using your camera.  When I think of the time &amp; expense in camera selection and composing a picture &amp; in many instances the $$ getting to the places where I wish to capture an image, this seems like a very small expenditure when considering the whole "picture".

$review_text.: We have two of these cables and they both are working out very well.  I have one to connect my phone and tablets to the HDTV in my bedroom.  Basically, I keep it attached to one of the HDMI ports on my HDTV and the other end over by the bed.  This way I can just plug in my Samsung phone or Archos tablet and throw whatever it is I want to watch up on the &amp;#34;big screen.&amp;#34;  (The Samsung also offer a wireless (wifi) ability to do the same, but not all applications support this feature.  The cable, though, works in almost all cases.)My Son has the second cable and uses it both at home and when out.  He has a Kindle Fire HD and uses the cable to connect the Kindle to both his HDTV and those at the homes of other people.As I said in the title, I'm not sure how much there is to say about cable other than it works fine.

My PC's built in ports are being used for my headset, I needed to get a line in and line out for a second device, and this allows me to do that with a single USB line
I plugged it in and it was immediately detected and worked fine, but a few of the ports didn't show up until I installed the included driver
The only complaint is that the blue light on top (which blinks if you don't have the driver installed or stays on steady if the driver is installed) is really bright, to the extent that if I shut off the lights and my monitor, it's the brightest thing in the room, which was a minor annoyance when trying to sleep


I had to cover it with tape.As for some more specialized advice, the second device I'm using this for is an amateur radio
I have this connected to my TS-820S for use with soundcard modes, and it has a good 2dB improvement in signal reception signal-to-noise over the on-motherboard ports, and I get signal reports back that are slightly better, but it's very variable

You can buy better sound cards for this purpose, but let's be honest - this probably isn't going to be the weakest part in your system


Definitely the best value for your money for any purpose.By the way, this product is exactly the same asVantec USB External 7.1 Channel Audio Adapter (Black),Diamond External Xtreme Sound 7.1-Channel USB Audio Device,StarTech.com 7.1 USB Audio Adapter External Sound Card with SPDIF Digital Audio Sound Cards ICUSBAUDIO7D, andSabrent USB-SND8 8-Channel 3D USB 2.0 External 7.1 Surround Sound Box with Digital Output


The prices vary, so shop around.

Contrary to my expectations, the Touchwhiz UI adds value to Android and the bundled apps are useful. the tablet is ready to use right out of the box, unlike the Nexus 74. Jelly Bean!5. Good battery life6. USB on the go! I could basically every USB peripheral, mouse, keyboard and thumb drivesCons:1. At 370gms, it's slightly on the heavier side for people wanting to use it as an eBook reader2. Screen is low-res which matters on a text-heavy webpage/app3.

I contacted amazon right away and they sent out a replacement TV close to immediately and sent UPS to pick the 1st damaged one up free of charge!  Needless to say when the second TV came (only 2 days later) I was very nervous.  WOW - what a nice TV for the price!  It has a great pictue and was very easy to set up.  So far I am loving it!  The only flaw I could find was the base that you put the TV on - when the TV is attached to the base with the little &amp;#34;pole&amp;#34; it is wobbly but seems to be fine.  I have no regrets about this purchase.

I was astonished at the sound quality of this product. It really does cut out a lot of background sounds and the buds which come in different plug sizes stay put in my ears. I think they were only about $12 which is amazing. I didn't want to spend much on yet another ear set that would just fall out or get broken. I would have happily paid five times the price if I had known that I could get this quality and comfort.

$REVIEW.: Main thing is that I can't use it well with my speedlight, it doesn't fit (the hole is not big enough for the speedlight head to get in). I made it to work with my Canon Flash (550EX) by tying the flash upside down on the stand with a rubber band (instead of fitting it on the hotshoe).Also the sewing is very flimsy, just opening and closing the umbrella a couple of times makes the stitch come out. I sewed again over the stiches at the tips where the metal(plastic) tips of the frame come out.The light is good though - I think its better than a shoot through umbrella. Wish it had a better build quality!!!!Not recommended if you need to use it with Speedlites (or Speedlights for that matter).

$review_text.: I did have some issues with the drives not working,  I ended up reinstalling the drivers and they all took (Windows 7 Ultimate.  I'm used to XP Pro.).  The other problem I had was that I was left with an open mic and 'What U Hear' was set open so whatever sound was picked up would be echoed in the headset and feedback would build till it was a high pitch tone.  It was a bit confusing trying to find the setting in the Creative Console Launcher.  I had it in Game Mode and didn't realize that you can chance the last three slots manually.  I needed to bring up Microphone FP (Front Panel) and click the speaker to turn it off.  I also set the REC to Microphone FP rather then What U Hear and everything works now.  This isn't a fault of Creative or Microsoft but will hopefully help someone else having the same trouble.The other problem I had was fitting the front panel in a 5.25" drive bay.  The metal seems to have been folded a bit on the wide side and would not fit in my Cool Master ATCS 840 case.  I ended up taking a small hammer and peening the fold so it could fit.  Other then that it wasn't too bad.  I do wish the cables for the FP were longer.  The ATCS 840 is a large case (Full-Tower) and the FP is on the top bay.  The card is on the bottom slot so it's a LONG reach.  It isn't a problem if you run the cables across but there is no way to hide them.  Be aware, the volume control are fine so you'll have to turn it a lot to get it to adjust.  The mic volume controls are also nice since you can adjust it on the fly without having to bother with buried menus.  Although once set you tend not to have to play around with it.  The FP is a glossy black but still looks nice against a black brushed aluminum case.Overall the sound quality is very nice.  It's cleaner then my Audigy 2 ZS.  The CMSS-3D works well and does sound nice, too.  The three modes make for simple presets and the FP allows you to switch them on and off quickly.

This router works perfectly, no wifi constantly going down.  I don't have to re-input network information every two days.  I plugged everything in, turned the wifi off on my modem, and the medialink worked IMMEDIATELY.  I went in to change some preferences, but if you aren't tech savvy.  This is the router to get.  Follow the simple instructions, plug it in, turn it on, turn off your modem wifi if it has it (otherwise it may confuse you, and I've noticed that the Qwest router interferes with the signal).  You don't have to turn off wifi, the medialink is plug it in and forget it if that's all you need.  They have excellent tech support too, if you need it.  Forget about the more expensive brands, this has been my best experience with a router, period.  I have owned many routers, linksys, belkin, netgear, and many others.  This is by far the most painless router experience I've had so far.  Oh and by the way, my wireless download speed increased on my 40mb/s connection from less than 500k/sec (actual download speeds) up to 35mb/sec.  That is 70 times faster than what Century Link said was their best router.  Also, if you have a choice (I don't)  DO NOT GO WITH CENTURY LINK OR QWEST ON YOUR DSL SERVICE. --Xexyz(Zeke) Gadget and Science Nerd Incarnate--

I'm not an audiophile by any means. My main source of music is my iPod. Anyways, I've had these Grados for 4 years and the build and sound quality is excellent. These headphones bring new life to your existing music collection. I'm pretty rough with my headphones, and these are the only pair of headphones that have lasted this long for me.In less than four years, I've broken:Sennheiser HD280 (which also had excellent sound quality) - and the foam started falling apart and the headband broke, but the headphones still produced fine sound,Sony MDR-blah-blah (lesser sound quality) - build quality really sucks the foam started peeling in about a month,4 different Skull-Candy earbuds (decent sound quality. better than the Sonys). I keep buying the skull-candy earbuds because they're more convenient for flights and travel. Unfortunately, they keep breaking. It's pretty annoying.Anyways, the only pair of headphones that have lasted this long are the Grado SR60. Plus, the Grado SR60 has the best sound quality along with the Sennheiser HD280.

Take the GR III, it's not the smallest or doesit have the longest zoom lens or is it the cheapest.  Actually, it's pretty pricey. And it's not for everyone.  And if I hadn't gotten it for free, I wouldn't have bought it. But now that I have had some time to use it, I really like it.As I said above, this isn't the smallest camera. It's considerably bigger than the newer Canon SD series. However, it will comfortably fit in a shirt pocket. It is also quite a bit heavier. The body appears to be of metal with a rubber covered grip.  The grip is nice sized and very comfortable. There is a nice 3" LCD on the back for composing and viewing images.  As has become the norm on P&amp;S; cameras, there isn't an optical viewfinder. On the top, there is the typical power button, shutter release, and mode dial. A nice little feature is that the mode dial locks so that it can't change settings accidently. Also on top is a hot shoe for using an external flash. You almost never see this on a camera this small. The camera also has a small built in flash.On the subject of a zoom lens, there isn't one.  The GRIII comes with a fixed 28mm (35 equivalent), fast f1.9 lens. Why no zoom lens? My guess is that Ricoh went for quality here (and they achieved it). This wide angle lens is great for landscapes, shooting around the house, street photography, and macro shots. And with the fast f1.9 aperture, you can easily control the depth of field to blur the background if desired.The camera has many shooting features. Some, like Snap Focus, the leveling aid, and High contrast B&amp;W; mode are not found on any other P&amp;S; cameras. I recommend you download the manual (available on Ricoh's website) and read up on these if you're thinking of getting this camera.For me, the most important aspect of a P&amp;S; is image quality. Due to the small sensor size, you get more noise and less detail than digital SLRs. In P&amp;S; cameras, there are two basic sizes. The smallest (the one in most P&amp;S; cameras) and a slightly larger one that is found in the bigger sized point and shoot cameras. The larger one is found in the bigger Canon G11, G12, and Nikon s7000 cameras. As I write this, there are only 3 really pocketable cameras that use the bigger sensor... the Canon S90, its replacement the S95, and this camera. In this case size does matter. The larger sensor gives you a lot less noise and better detail. Couple this with the Ricoh's lens and very good image processing engine, and you end up with images that are better than most. I've been happy with 13 x 19 inch prints and probably could go bigger. Is it as good as a digital SLR? No, but it close and nowhere near as big and heavy.In conclusion, this camera is not for everyone.  The casual shooter taking holiday pictures would be better served by a smaller, cheaper point and shoot. But if you normally use a wide angle lens, want a lot of shooting features, and the highest image quality you can get in a pocketable camera, give this a look.

$REVIEW.: I installed this on a new Windows 8.1 based PC.Initially, I had an odd issue of my PC not displaying anything on a monitor hooked up to DVI port

 Then I connect another monitor to a VGA port and suddenly the display comes back to both monitors

 Same thing happened again when upgrading video driver versions


 Windows 8.1 tries to switch video driver versions then I lose my display
 I connect something to VGA port and I get my display back

 I also noticed, when BIOS boots, it did not display manufacturer's logo


 I've called ASUS tech support but the agent I spoke with kept beating around the bush and did not assist me

 According to him, it is working, so I had nothing to worry about.It took me 3 days of research and logical deduction to figure this out


 Apparently, this video card shipped with a firmware made for traditional BIOS

 So when connected to UEFI based machines (which Windows 8 requires), security verification fails, then it goes into this odd behavior
 There are two ways to resolve this.1)  Upgrade the firmware on this video card to UEFI ready version2)  Turn off UEFI in BIOS and go back to traditional modeI took the latter route as it was easier

 Now everything works as it should

 Performance is perfectly acceptable for my use


 Having an ability to do dual display is great
 I may hook up a third in near future.Conclusion is, this video card, as shipped, is not truly Windows 8 compliant

 At least mine was not


 If anyone is having odd issues, my suggestion is to verify the BIOS version, then try disabling UEFI bios if possible.

$REVIEW.: I thought to myself that people exaggerate and it just couldn't be That good! Especially for its size and weight but this thing is incredible for sure!!! My girlfriend was in the other room when I brought it home and set it up...Then I turned it on and adjusted bass/treble and turned it up to 20, (it goes up to 40 but 20 was PLENTY!) She walked in the room where I was at with her mouth hanging open and said "OMG I thought it was HUGE by the sound of it, but it's just a normal size boombox!" Believe the hype people cause this thing can get down and dirty right now!!!
$SUMMARY.: Even after reading all the rave reviews didn't prepare me.

The only thing that isn't perfect is that the swivel mechanism loosens pretty quickly, so it slips out of position fairly easily when plugging into the outlets. I especially bought this model because unlike others, it doesn't block the second wall outlet. You don't gain much with those others if you block both wall outlets, then get 3 outlets on the device. In this case. you end up with 4 outlets, which is nice, though I don't use the outlets often.

 Also, the software did not come packaged and was nearly impossible to find on the internet

My iPad Air audibly clicked into the edged case with precision, but that lead to a negative remark (see below)


I removed the outer bumper from the inner support bracket and found this to be a great scratch and dent prevention method.- CONS -It's bulky and it adds more than twice the depth to the device.The biggest disappointment was in fitting the snap in the internal case

As I snapped my device into the case, the protective film was gouged out of place
Oddly enough, the precision of the case measurements don't allow for a film without some serious intervention

And since I had already spent an inordinate amount of time getting all the invisible fuzz off my screen before adding the protective film, I became frustrated
The protective film is now serving as a book cover, which incidentally, is an excellent reuse for old phone films.I'm giving this item -2 for driving me insane with irritation

+3 for exacting measurements with zero tolerance.

$REVIEW.: The Targus case is very stylish, sleek and slim, and holds the iPad snugly
The case works OK as a stand in Landscape position, but it isn't designed for such a use and isn't all that safe


When in Portrait position the angle is too sharp to use most of the time
The case has magnets to turn the iPad on/off, but these magnets aren't strong enough to keep the case closed, which kind of ruins the feature


If the cover is going to keep flapping open, why would I want my iPad turning on every time? (you can turn the 'wake with cover' feature off on the iPad, the pref is under General in Settings)The iPad slides in through the top, then there is a little flap of material that folds over it to keep it in
It is probably more secure than it looks, but I still don't like it (with my iPad 2 anyway -- the new iPad fits snugly and will not fall out on its own)

It also leaves the upper corners of the iPad exposed and unprotected


Also, the camera used for FaceTime is partially blocked (for the new iPad) and is hard to maneuver into an effective place
I think this is probably due to the fact that the new iPad fits so snugly, but doesn't sit quite centered in the case (iPad 2 seemed fine)


All other buttons, switches and the other camera are easily accessible (both versions of iPad).Overall the case is sleek and protects the iPad decently, but it could still use some tuning for functionality


And it needs a price drop.Here is the case I use (I really like it too, though its magnet feature doesn't work at all with the new iPad):BoxWave Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 Smart Case - Ardent Red, Premium Synthetic iPad3 Leather Folio Case w/ Multi-Angle Stand for iPad 2 and The new iPad (3rd Generation)

$review_text.: My router has always been in the basement resulting in weak wireless signals in some areas of my house. Now my router is on the main floor while the modem remains in the basement. I bought these because they are small. I don't need high speed since this is only the link to the internet which at best is 15 Meg. But, I do want it to be reliable. After 1 week, it seems to be reliable. However, I have not yet streamed anything. I did have a couple of unexplained disconnects that I resolved by unplugging one adapter and then plugging it back in. Since then, I've moved one of the adapters off of a circuit that is protected by a AFCI (arc fault) breaker. Set up did not go as described. It took me hours to get these two connected to each other. At one point I think one of them was connected to my neighbors powerline network. I also set his up about a year ago. That setup (also D-Link) did not go well either.I can't find any instructions on how to unpair the DHP-309AV. Anyway, I think all is well now.

$REVIEW.: So far I have gotten great results with this lens on my 20D. I have a 50mm 1.8, a Nikon manual 100mm 2.8 with an EOS adapter, and the older (non-IS) 18-55mm kit lens. The 24mm was the perfect complement to my setup, rounding out my prime lenses, and making up for the kit lens. I've gone back and forth about whether or not the 28mm would have been a better value (20-30% cheaper), but I think the wider angle, especially on a cropped sensor, was worth it.I just took ~200 pictures with it of my newborn nephew in the hospital with low indoor lighting (too low for the kit lens), and I was very happy with the speed and field of view of the lens.This lens is great for head shots with a ring light. Close enough to only have someones face in the frame (~1.5-2.5 ft), there is some distortion of features, but I find it not unpleasant, and sometimes I prefer it.Compared to the 50mm 1.8 Mk II, the build quality is great, with a metal mount, a much more solid feel, and a much better manual focus. The manual focus is not as smooth as my Nikon manual lens, or an L-series lens, but I am pleased with it.I can't remember what the minimum focus distance is, but it is much shorter than the 50mm, but not quite as short as the kit lens. It is just right for close-ups of a flower with a landscape in the background.I just recently "discovered" Canon's Digital Photo Professional software for RAW conversion, but sadly it does not have this lens included in the list of lenses that it can adjust distortion and CA for. I have not found that I need those adjustments, but I would have liked to see what they could have done.Overall, I would recommend the lens, but if you have a tight budget, the 28mm, although I have not used it, might not be a bad compromise.

If I had the money, I'd buy them in a second purely because of the price. New speakers for under $200 with a wide frequency range, bi-amp gold plated binding posts and real wood on top of it all? There are many other budget speakers out there that are very superior to these... they'll cost you at least $170 more though.Polk is probably the only large mass-consumer audio brand that deserves some respect. They put out solid, good sounding products. Right now you can buy a cheap sherwood reciever, a PSW10 sub and these... which will be a respectable sounding stereo set-up for under $350.P.S: I probably am coming across as selling polk pretty hard, but I really am just a normal guy who appreciates getting solid sound for a reasonable amount of money.

$REVIEW.: I bought this lens recently to put on myNikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lensand see whether I wanted this lens or theTokina AT-X116PRDXN AT-X PRO DX 11-16mm Ultra-wide Angle Lens for Nikon.I'll start off by saying both lenses are great lenses and I did not have any image quality problems with either.I am no great photographer or reviewer of photography equipment, but I will give the things I liked and didn't like about each lens that led me to my decision of which to keep.Nikon - The main thing this lens has over the Tokina for me is that the autofocus will work on the d5100.  I wasn't sure how big of an issue this would be on a wide angle lens.  It turned out that it was handy to have, but focusing on something at 11mm is super easy to do and gives me something to do.  The Nikon does have a wider range of zoom 10-24 instead of 11-16, but I'm not losing out on much since I already have aNikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.Tokina - This lens is quite a bit heavier and seems to suggest it is made from more durable materials.  It also has a constant 2.8 aperture which, although I won't be using constantly, is nice to have.  The Tokina has a lot nicer focus ring and has not given me any problems.  Tokina is about 200 bucks cheaper as well.In the end I went with the Tokina because there was nothing about the Nikon that made me think it was worth more money.  I'm not saying it is overpriced, maybe just the Tokina is underpriced.  If they were the same price it would really be a toss up.  If you already have a camera that has in-body autofocus, I would definitely go with the Tokina.This is a great, fun lens - even though I ended up returning it.

$review_text.: OK I admit I don't know what a 5 star motherboard is like.  I've built a few AMD Phenom x6 and Intel I7 2600K systems with Gigabyte mother boards and have been very happy.  I wanted the Z68 chipset in this one.  The boards came out very similar in my research and to be honest I don't remember the exact reason I chose this one but I'm happy.The feature set of this board is great.  Lots of USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.  2 SATA controllers with 8 ports.  Built in Bluetooth is nice.I really like the headers they supply for the front panel lights and switches and USB (I'd like to buy more of those, they only give us one).My biggest complaint so far is the high speed PCIe 2_16 x4 slot is on the edge of the board so I couldn't install the NVidia GTX560 in that slot because it is a double wide card.  The headers for USB, HD audio, Front panel and 1394 are in the way.  I'm not sure if it makes a difference, I need more research on this.The other thing that may not have anything to do with the MB is that I could not use the stock Intel CPU heatsink/fan.  Running the I72600K at full bore it was reporting temps of 94-96C.  I put in a CoolerMaster Hyper 212+ and they went down to 67-72C.  The same CPU has run much cooler other systems I've built and this case seems to have better airflow.

I have been using Macintosh Powerbooks for the last eight years and it was an ergonomic gem


The working surface of the laptop was curved and I never once experienced pain while typing, even if I spent 10 hours a day typing


The Macbook has a sharp edge that cuts into my palms &amp; wrists and it causes so much pain I have to stop typing.I have no idea how designers could or would create a laptop with such a horrible flaw
I work at NASA and we work tirelessly on the ergonomics of every design to lessen the impact on astronauts
It is mindboggling how Apple designers could be so careless in the design of their laptops.They probably only cared about 'how it looked' instead of how it functioned


I know if I designed this computer I would NEVER have made such a ridiculous blunder


Why would Apple stray away from a perfectly designed laptop (the Powerbook) and go to a hard edged design
Hell, why didn't they just put razor blades on the edge where your wrists rest? Are you listening Apple designers? Or do you care? Probably not...Related Info: I ordered this computer because it was the last Mac laptop to have a flat screen

Apple seems to have sold out to the PC world by going exclusively to glossy screens

There are no advantages to glossy screens

They give so much glare you can't even see what you are doing, especially if you are in public

Glossy screens render laptops useless outside because you can't even see the display
This is another huge blunder Apple is making.When are corporations going to start designing what the consumer wants instead of forcing stupid designs on consumers?

 This not a "stabilizing" shoulder mount, but a stabilizer when sitting on its feet or to use the handle to the side to better grip the camera

 It was a lot easier to use the handle than the hand grip which forces you to crock your wrist to keep the camera level


 I use the handle with the Canon HF G20, on and off the tripod this weekend, with a shotgun mike on top


 I like the mike better on the top of this handle than mounted on the shoe on the camera

 I personally do not like all the weight of a shock mounted mike putting on that pressure on the case of the camera

 The top shoe can be position in any direcction.If the camera mount screw is too long, I would suggest grinding down the end to shorten the amount of threads rather than use washers in between the base and the camera
Shorten the threads allows the camera bottom to fit flush on the bottom to the mount, providing a better grip.

 I've never found another mouse with buttons as functional or in the right places like this mouse

 I use recharable batteries and have to charge them every 3 months or so

 That's with 8hr/day of use.I don't use a mouse pad and the only problem I've ever had was the mouse sometimes gets confused when used on tables with wooden patterns (like a mahogany, etc table)

So, I just used a piece of paper as a mouse pad

$REVIEW.: Just got this unit in, and so far, works quite nicely on my iMac running OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion). Special thanks to to reviewer  Dick Guertin "Dickster" (who had very good info on running this on a Mac), and reviewer sunman42 (who mentioned in a comment to my review that it also works in OS X 10.9 - Mavericks). I did not bother with the instructions, and the CD coming with it is useless for Mac.Briefly, hook up the player via USB, download Audacity 2.0.5 (free), change Mac System Preferences - Sound - Input - to "USB PnP Audio Device". In Audacity, go to the Transport tab and turn off Overdub, and turn on Software Playthrough (can also be changed under Audacity - Preferences - Recording).When playing your tape, press the round red "recording" button in the Audacity window; without pressing it I couldn't hear the playback. When song is finished, press the square brown "stop" button. To save the recorded song, go to File - export - and name your file and format (I used AIFF for Mac). Once saved to my desktop, I then delete the recording from Audacity by clicking the 'X' beside Audio Track in the Audacity window. I haven't played around with all the filters and effects yet. I converted only around 20 songs so far, so cannot judge longevity of the unit yet.For now, I give it 5 stars, since the unit is inexpensive, plays my tapes without problems so far, and I was ready to record in 5 minutes (with the helpful info from the other reviewer mentioned above).

 However, for the price of the kit, a new home button should have at least been included if not mounted on the screen

When I removed the button from the mass of broken glass I didn't realize that I now had no way of affixing it to the new screen


 No way could I have known that inside the mass of glass chips was the very important rubber ring and adhesive


 As a result, I now have just the plastic button flopping around in the hole of the screen
In order to install a new button I would have to destroy a very expensive screen.Also, the 3M tape was a disappointment

 When I peeled off the backing the adhesive stayed with it.For less than half the price you can buy the complete package of screen, tools, home button and adhesive right here on Amazon


 Too bad I didn't do my homework.UPDATE:I bought a new home button but while installing it the screen became unplugged and after countless attempts I still could not plug it onto the board again


Finally the connecting "cable" broke and that ended the repair project

This is truly a state-of-the-art media player, Internet device, and, with the $10 purchase of the iPhone 2.0 software, mobile computing platform.  This device is so much more than just an iPod.  If you can't afford to pay AT&amp;T;'s insane monthly iPhone rates ($70 without text messages last I checked), this is as good as it gets.Before I get too in depth, I just want to strongly recommend that you forgo the cheaper 8 GB model and go for the 16 GB.  I was seriously considering the 8 GB model because, hey, I was only upgrading because my iTunes library was just over 2 GB.  I am very glad that I went for the 16 GB now, however.  If you would like to put podcasts, video files, and iPhone 2.0 applications on your iPod, they are going to take up more space than you would think.  I currently have over 9 GB of stuff on my iPod even though my music library is only about 600 songs (about 2.25 GB).I know that it's a little pricey to go for the 16 GB, but I actually bought mine used on eBay for less than the price of a new 8 GB (with a hard shell case, screen protector, and the original box to boot).  Plus, you'll be much less inclined to want to upgrade in the future as long as you have plenty of space on your current device.  I would even say go for the 32 GB if your budget can handle it.The iPod Touch is not only a great device for music, but an even better device for video.  The 3.5 inch widescreen display is very sharp and not as small as it sounds.  It's great for watching video podcasts and even full length TV shows and movies.The internet experience on the iPod Touch is just phenomenal.  You're not just getting the "mobile internet", you're getting full web pages exactly the way you're used to seeing them on your computer at home (minus flash and the big screen of course).  The multi-touch navigation of web pages is very slick and easy to get the hang of.  This is a mobile browser that you'll actually use.Also, if you are planning on purchasing your iPod Touch new, please make sure that you get the iPhone 2.0 software from Apple so that you can get access to the "App Store".  I was lucky enough to already have it installed on mine when I bought it, but the upgrade costs $10 if you buy your iPod new.Even though some of the apps cost $5 or $10, the majority are free.  Some cool apps that you can download on to your iPod for free include AOL Instant Messenger, eBay, New York Times headlines, Wordpress, and Facebook.  There's also an app called movies that will list all movie showtimes at the theaters in your area, as well as a super cool baseball app that gives the baseball geek access to the past century of statistics or trivia wherever he may be.  The list goes on and on for the cool stuff that you can install.Now, while the iPod Touch is the closest thing out there to the iPhone experience, it still has its disadvantages compared to Apple's smartphone.  For example, while you can access the Internet, read and send e-mail, etc on your iPod Touch, it is only possible when you are near WiFi.  On the iPhone, if you are on-the-go and not near a wireless internet connection, you can do all of this over the celluar network which is available almost everywhere you are.  The opportunity to use WiFi, on the other hand, doesn't present itself as often as you may think.  If you're traveling and want to check your e-mail, it means stopping at a Starbucks or a Borders, and you won't get alerted right when your e-mails arrive like an iPhone user would.All those are things to consider if you are thinking of the iPod Touch as your way of getting around AT&amp;T;'s rate plans.  While the iPod Touch is the best iPod available, you won't have all the conveniences of an iPhone user.Another minor annoyance is that there is no volume button on the outside of the iPod, and when the iPod goes to sleep, you have to "slide to unlock" in order to use the touch volume controls.All in all, though, I am very happy with my iPod Touch.  It's the best portable media player out there and it does so much more than just that.  Highly recommended.

 I had an old cisco wireless "B" router that I was replacing

 I put the new one in exactly the same position and lost approximately 20% of my range


 I'd been told that the new "N" technology would be transmitted farther, but that's not the case with this router
 It's stable, and I haven't had to reset it yet.

$review_summary.: Works but range not that great

$review_text.: We've taken this on a few trips and the kids watch movies with no issues.  The volume is a little low, but all-in-all, it was a great buy.  We stop at Red Box, pick up a few DVDs, and the kids are content throughout the ride.Update: We've used it about a dozen times with no issues.  All the DVDs we've rented have worked with no issues.  The kids can plug their headphones into it and away we go.It's a little hard to see from an angle, but since it swivels, not much of an issue.  I see a lot of people are having issues and/or don't like it.  I guess we're lucky because we do like it and I'd recommend it.Also to note: the case it comes with is ok, but it didn't fit on the back of the headrest in our Kia Sedona minivan, just an FYI.  No biggie though as they just put it on the console in between the seats.

I bought it as a screen extension to my DJ laptop to allow me to monitor Traktor2 from it as I don't like the smaller screen that comes with any laptop.It is certainly apparent from taking it out from the box that it is not the most expensive monitor but asthetics asides it performs well enough and gets the job done. Its screen is bright and clear , looks good in native and has a good refresh rate for those of you who may use it to play games or watch video's.I am well pleased with this buy and more so considering the price I got it for.....you would not be able to buy a used 20 inch monitor of this quality for the price I paid. Well done Amazon, I bought a few things on the sale week and none have disappointed....apart from the ones I was too late to buy!The five starts have been given not for overall performance, but for the overall performance at the price.

I honestly go through about two or three a year
I always buy cheap mice but this is by far the cheapest

Item arrived less than two days after order which was great
This is obviously a very cheap mouse and people really shouldn't have high expectations

Don't get me wrong, it works and suits my needs
That being said there are some pros and cons to this.Pros:- Item was very cheap and probably wouldn't mind buying another in 6 months or so.- It has an on/off switch, which my last one did not have.- Very lightweight, and has a blue laser on the bottom which ie easier on the eyes than red.- Comes in just about any color you can imagine.-It's VERY CHEAP!!!!!!Cons:-Had a very hard time opening up compartment where batteries are installed, which in turn chipped the cover, had to tape cover back on.-It is cheap in price, and feels very cheap in your hands, like cheap chinese plastic.-It will not operate properly on my desk surface, when many others have worked.-I will have to buy a mousepad to use this on my desk, for now using a magazine.So,overall this is a good buy if you want a cheap mouse that WILL work

I reccomend this to anyone unless you don't want a mousepad
That being said I may be looking for a replacement in the near future, but really isn't the product's fault, just a personal preference.So if you read this review, please remark as to whether it was helpful or not, and feel free to ask questions or comment.

$review_text.: Works well for display port or DVI connections but if you need to connect to a H MDI connector through an adapter particularly the Seiki 4K unit it would not work with PNY Quadro NVS 510 Graphic Card.  The software is very tricky to do a custom install as the cards not able to recognize this monitored through the adapter You got a check two boxes to try to make custom settings, but that not clear form the screen.  The Seiki documentation is terrible but the interlace mode would work but the settings could not be saved.  Various calls to customer support or worthless.  I had a very high level software engineer I could not get to work either.  Had to return but did not use Amazon because they were out of stock and not sure what I am going to face.On the other hand, the included Nvidia desktop software is really nice and I have used it for four years.  The fact that the card only takes 35 W is great.In contrast,EVGA GeForce GT 630 1GB DDR3 Dual DVI, mHDM Worked right away it was only $70.  The 2 GB model is probably better as it took for gigabytes of system memory using 4K monitor as well as to 1K MONITORS on the side.The card only draws 25 W but be sure to get the Kepler model.  The box says it only supports 2.5 K but the website is correct about 4K.

$REVIEW.: Pros - excellent small size and no wires results in less clutter on the desk.Cons - Keyboard has been reduced in size so much that the PageUp, PageDown, Home and End keys require also pressing a function key at the same time which is awkward and annoying.Touchpad has almost no configuration options, no sensitivity setting, no scroll zones and verticle scrolling requires dragging two fingers up or down the middle of the touchpad and parallel with the sides.  Since your hand and fingers are not typically positioned in a way that is also exactly parallel to the sides of the touchpad, scrolling can be inconsistent.  Touch and drag almost never works.As a desktop replacement keyboard, this is not the greatest solution, but there are few products that include an integrated touchpad.As a remote control keyboard, perhaps to a laptop connected to a TV, this is an excellent choice.Note: I purchased this direct from Logitech since Amazon had a two month shipping delay.
$review_summary.: Not perfect, but fairly good - touchpad has been dumbed down

$review_text.: I bought this adapter because the SDHC cards are cheaper than CF cards, and the Canon 50D only comes with the CF slot.  I'm very satisfied with the performance of the adapter, I'm able to shoot in excess of 1,200 shots (RAW) from a 32gig card.  I don't know the exact number because the camera only goes to 999.  I haven't noticed any lag times or any other negatives while using this product.  It's a real cost saver!

Especially with free truck delivery service I'm not sure why anyone would purchase a TV from anywhere else but Amazon.  I bought this TV because the previous Samsung TV (42") was too small for my Living Room which is fairly big at 12x 22 square feet with raised ceilings.  So I decided that the 50" would be just perfect and it turns out the size is just right. Yes, this TV is only 720p but it has such clear images that you cant help be amazed.  When watching tv using a bluray dvd player or my apple tv the images come out amazingly crisp. In fact the only time you will notice a little bluriness is when your real close to the tv and it is not on an hdtv channel. So if you have cable make sure you choose the HDTV option or else your seriously missing out.  the only other problem with the image is that sometimes I see a red glare in the tv that looks a lot like a laser light moving around from inside the tv. But this only happens once in a while and quickly goes away. Also, be aware that this is a plasma tv so make sure to no leave you gaming system or or any other channel that has still images. I have notices that images have temporarily burnt through but I think samsung has some kind of technology on this system that helps to quickly remove the images from the TV in a matter of minutes. But dont worry as of today I still do not have any permannt burnt images to my TV (and I have accidentally left a lot of things on that I should have). Perhaps the greatest thing I love about this TV is that I was questioning whether or not I should buy this plasma over an LCD.  Recently I have also bought an LCD that was 1080 from LG and I honeslty do not feel that it comes out as colorful and it has a limited viewing angle.  On this TV you can view it from any angle, but on my LG 42" LCD it looks fantastic (yes, and crisper than this tv) but it if I am not staring directly at it it fades white depending how far off I view the tv from the angle.  So for a living room, I would suggest the Plasma.  For a bedroom I would suggest the LCD (which is breathtaking in its own right for different reasons).This tv has many optional components such as hooking up your videogames systems to the HDMI port which makes videogames really come to life.  Even my intel wireless display seems look better on this tv even though I am using a brand new computer that I purchased from amazon as well.  It also has a vga output for all of you who cannot connect thier computer with hdmi or intel wireless so that you can watch televison programing through the internet (internet tv is a million times better; in fact I am thinking about getting rid of my cable bill!)  So basically I am really happy about the purchase.  I do have two of the same tv in different sizes and an LCD tv by LG so it made it easier for me to compare. I hope this will help you guys out with making your decision!  If you want to know more about the LG LCD 42" please be sure to check back later as I plan to write a review for this product as well.

I knew what I was getting despite of all the reviews saying it is 18Ft cableI knew it was 18Feet of cable and is definitely worth the price. You get what you PAY for. . Will definitely buy againPros: Excellent high quality subwoofer speaker cable for the applications that require it. High current handlingensures proper high power low bass loading into the subwoofer. Make sure you have the right woofer specsor you're gonna cook your woofer this subwoofer speaker cable supports high current (literally) throughput.Cons: NONE (Not necessarily a con, but it is quite thick, you may have to trim some excess wire to fit connection(s)I definitely recommend this product to all who need high quality subwoofer cable for systems under 1000Wbut if you're going big you'd be better off with lower gauge higher current supporting thicker wire cable instead.

$review_text.: Battery works well with my Canon SD4500. It lasts longer than the original. I haven't timed anything, but I'd say it lasts about twice as long, or nearly. This is very nice, since the original battery didn't last long at all. It's also not great, since lasting longer than the original battery is no great feat.I keep the original battery fully charged and in the camera case as back-up. This works out pretty well, and almost makes up for the fact that Canon somehow managed to create a battery that barely lives up to it's appointed task.UPDATE: In less than a year, maybe 8 months, the battery started to hold very little charge and would only last for maybe 50 photos or 20-30 minutes of video recording.

$REVIEW.: This headphone works great. It does exactly what I want it to do - provide nice clear audio. Either my husband or I tend to use this even when there are others in the room watching TV also. Blocks out surrounding noise, like talking children! Also, we don't have to turn on Closed Caption when watching because you hear exactly what you want to hear. I was very pleasantly surprised to hear things in the background of the movies - like birds, footsteps, etc. Things that are part of the audio, but you usually don't hear. Only problem - we only bought one, so we'll have to buy a second pair so both of us can use them at the same time. We have had this headphone for several months now. I like the volume control on the headphone and the battery power (rechargeable) lasts a long time - we've never had to return the headphone to the base while watching because of low battery. Just put it back to re-charge when you are not using them and they are always ready to go. I think the price is also very reasonable compared to other similar models - especially when you catch it on sale.

$review_text.: I reviewed the reviews before buying and it sounded like this device should work with an iPhone 4 in a case, but it does not. Maybe it depends on which case you have, but it does not work with the Speck case I have. The only way it even fits in the cradle is by hyper-extending the spring arms, and even then it holds the phone at an angle with a very tenuous grip. One bump and the phone falls out.

$REVIEW.: I love this camera


 It produces the most amazing pictures


 No noise, sharp, stunning colors

 I recently compared it to a Panasonic Lumix point and shoot, and the Panasonic came out the loser by a large margin
 My only problem with the 550 is that it gives me the low battery indicator light on freshly charged batteries


 This is very annoying
 I've found that the higher mah batteries tend to do better

 I've also recently invested in a high-end battery charger to make sure that the batteries I use in the Canon are fully charged (something I can't do with the cheapy chargers that typically come for free when you buy rechargeable batteries).My favorite setting: Manual, ISO 200, No flash


 If you hold the camera steady, you'll get amazing pictures indoors and outdoors.

I've used this lens for everything from shooting birds to shooting concerts and it very infrequently lets me down.My copy of the lens is sharp even at 200mm.  Wide open sharpness and contrast are very similar to an older, non-IS version of the Canon 70-200mm f2.8L lens when shot wide open.  To be fair, the Canon is a much better lens overall.  If the Canon lens is stopped down a little, it has a better image.  But wide open vs wide open, the Panasonic 45-200mm holds its own!I've also compared this lens to the Panasonic 45-150mm.  The 45-150mm may be just a tad sharper, but for all practical purposes they are very similar in image quality.  Personally, I like the extra 50mm of reach that the 45-200 gives you.The lens is a little bit large when compared to other m4/3 lenses, but to me, it has a nice solid feel.I have no regrets about purchasing this lens.  It's very practical, offers great value and great image quality.

The connection speed varies greatly, it will go from 1-2 bars to 4-5 bars and vice-versa multiple times within a few minutes sometimes..  It loses connection a lot, but only for a few seconds, or about a minute max. I'm thinking it has something to do with how hot it gets (it gets very hot for what it is.)  I don't see it lasting very long, definitely not something you would want for gaming because of all the signal drops.  This thing can/will drop signal 10+ times in an hour with no known interference.  I have an older router, but did not get nearly this many signal drops with my other adapters using the same router, and got faster speeds most of the time.Pros:  Cheap, very easy setup (plug and play), small and looks nice.Cons: Unreliable speeds, unstable connection, runs hot.

I paid just over $75/used copy on amazon.com and for that price you get a very good lens BUT... although it's very sharp in the center throughout the range (f/1.7 to f/8), it did have very soft corner results from about f/1.7 to around f/2.8. I think the lens tack sharp "hot spot" range is at f/5.6 to f/8 ...giving that better balance of center and corner sharpness. I would say it's not really a "great" low light lens if you're looking for overall sharpness near the wide open range but good for portrait photography and for those on a budget. For me, it just leaves me feeling that I could just save the money for a more expensive, newer and better lens.

$REVIEW.: For its size, the Memorex Party cube does deliver a decent amount of sound


 I like the versatility of this little device
 About the size of a 6-pack beer cooler, this cube will play CD's, AM/FM Radio, and your iPod or iPhone music


 The handle makes it very portable and because of its size, this is the perfect device to bring to all of your outdoor festivities


 It can run from an AC outlet or from an internal rechargeable battery, which makes it very easy to use, and you do not have to worry about carrying or constantly changing batteries.This is the safest docking station I have seen/used

The inverted well really does keep the connection pins safe from the mishaps my daughter experienced with her top dock

I now use it as my primary iPod charging station
The downside of this dock is that you must finger scroll on the iPod to navigate--there are no external controls on the dock.When not being used for outdoor activities, it looks tidy on the desk

I use it to play background music while I work on the computer


I am currently listening toBillie Holiday's Greatest Hitswhile I write this review


I prefer the softer music (sounds soothing) on the cube


 I can pump up theJeff Beck 3-Pak - Blow by Blow/Wired/There and BackandTexas Flood, but I would prefer my hardcore speakers for that

You can't pump this up to the loudest level without experiencing some distortion


 The music this cube puts out sounds clear and kosher--not exceptional, not ultra-powerful--after all, this isn't a Bose cube, but for the price, versatility, and convenience, the Memorex Party Cube sufficiently meets my expectations.Party time, excellent.Bohemian Rhapsody/These Are the Days of Our Lives

$REVIEW.: I did a lot of research on blue tooth speakers after seeing the jam box at a neighbors.The JBL Charge sounds great, holds a charge and allows me to charge my iPhone in a pinch


People that have heard this have liked it more than the small jam box.The volume is great and for the size it puts out a decent level of treble and base that surprised me for the size
The sound is very clear and can fill a room


Very easy to setup and pair with my phone

All you need to do is hold down the button to turn it into pairing mode, open up blue tooth on your phone and it pairs


Who you want to use it, just turn it on and it automatically pairs with the phone and stars playing the music
Be aware this allows for only one device to be paired to at a time.Understand what you are buying, this is not a $500 set of speakers and is just the size of a 16 oz can of beer, so you can only expect so much sound from it.We bring this with us when we go places and bring it outdoors when we want music outside.I liked this so much I bought one for my dad for his birthday and he loves it too.

$review_text.: Out of the box, this tablet is useful for e-mail, Pandora, viewing photos, and maybe some videos
 You have access to some market apps, but not the full android market

 And some of the apps you can get don't really work well on a tablet


 For example, the free spider solitaire app uses cards sized for a phone, and just spreads them out so far on the screen you actually have to turn your head to check for plays


 Video is a chancy business with fewer working than not working


 When they do work, they look good
 The screen, other than having a narrow viewing angle, is very good


 But it does show fingerprints easily


 I put on a Skinomi screen saver, and it helps


 Expect to use the internet for info often as you start trying expand your use of this tablet
 XDA developers is a very good resource, and has links to other resources


 Don't expect to just pick it up and use it as a laptop or netbook replacement right away, but it can come close after some research and effort.

The 28-75mm range on this Tamron fit the bill, and the reviews were generally good.I have to agree with them: this is a great little lens at a very good price

Focus is fast and accurate, and relatively quiet

DoF when wide open and at close range is very narrow, as expected, but lets you get images that might otherwise need extra light or extra-high ISO with the associated noise issues

The lens is well-built but not overly heavy

Manual focus, when I need to use it, is smooth but not too loose; this is the 'feel' that I prefer so I don't move past the right spot too easily
Image contrast is good, and images are realistic, without being overly warm/cool or saturated.Unless I know I'm going to need the more extreme ranges of my other lenses, this one stays on the camera.

$review_summary.: Highly recommended for Canon 6D

$REVIEW.: I've purchased 2 of these chargers because they work quite effectively
They also come with an extra USB charging cable that works flawlessly with your iPhone 3G or 3GS


The main car charging unit has a female USB connector as well as a handy replacable fuse just in case you connect it to the wrong voltage or it just wears out.You must be very careful when selecting a car charger for either your iPod Classic, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, iPod Touch, iPhone, iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS because each and every product has a slightly different voltage that is not necessarily compatible with every charging unit


I went through 3 chargers before I found this one and it performs flawlessly!To ensure that the car charger is effectively charging your iPhone or iPod, pay attention to the charging icon in the upper righthand corner of the screen

If the icon shows a battery with a lightning symbol in it for longer than 5 minutes, you can be assured it's charging properly

However, if it shows a plug-in symbol within the charging icon either immediately after you try charging it or after a few minutes, you can be assured that it is NOT compatible nor is it charging your device.Be aware that if you are charging your iPhone 3G or 3GS and using it heavily, like talking to someone on the phone while surfing the internet, or playing music while using Google Maps, the charging icon in the upper righthand corner will eventually display the plug-in symbol that indicates it's no longer charging
Be sure not to use the device heavily when you're charging it in your vehicle


For example, a phone call doesn't constitute heavy usage as it's one function being utilized at a time

More than one function operating, however, is not recommended when charging in your vehicle.

$review_text.: I replaced an EVGA card with this MSI card. A word to the wise, make sure if you ever purchase and EVGA that you register the product immediately or you will not get a full warranty. Just 7 days late and the warranty is significantly reduced. On to this card. I purchased this one because the MSI warranty and name is much better than the average card. This card installed into my existing PCI 2.0 Express x16 so it is backward compatible. Windows 7 found my card and the default drivers worked before I downloaded the latest drivers from MSI. When downloading the drivers, make sure you read the description of all of them since the UI does not make you choose OS, and 32 vs. 64 bits. Installation of the driver was easy. I play World of Warcraft, Star Wars, and D3 and I can turn the graphics up all the way and there are no issues. The card performs well. It uses less power than my previous card.

$REVIEW.: You can go to your pro photographer friends and ask for a recommendation... they may tell you BW, Heliospan, or a number of well know companies that make filters and have impecable reputations. If you buy on reputation or recommendation I think you are cutting yourself short. It is hard for a human being (the human eye) to objectively asertain the performance of a filter such as a UV filter... after all... we can't see UV light. We can see the haze in backgroung outdoor shots however it is hard to quantify it.I read a lab test on a large number of el-cheap and very expensive (the full range) of UV filters that were analyzed using a Hatachi "State of the Art" spectrometer. This device is design to determine how much light of various wavelengts are being filtered and how much is being let through.  I was SHOCKED and dismayed by the number of high end filter that didn't even measure up to the UV light filtering capabilites of plain old glass (glass is a good UV filter by itself!).  They also tested how much the filter stops down your lens (reducing incoming light) and though this one didn't fare as well as a high end unit (that produced no UV filtering) it is still very very good.The Hoya multi coated filters beat out ALL other in the UV tests.  I bought the PRO1 filter because it is slightly lower profile and won't contribute to vignetting on my wide angle lens.  The ring is metal... aluminum I think. It is also blackened to prevent reflections. Hope this helps someone... Google, "Filter Review Hatachi Spectrometer" to find and read the study yourself.  Apparently some of these highly regarded companies are sitting on their laurels and not putting forth quality products anymore.  Leave your mind open to Science... not to hype, recommendation (people tend to recommend their own bad purchases), and reputation.  Thanks.

The Klipsch retail for about $50 cheaper than the Sennheiser HD25-1 II, but I got them on Amazon for $70 during a sale. Unlike some of the low rated reviewers, I did get the same headphones as shown in the pics with the double band. I was a little disappointed with the quality build once again in comparison with the cheaper Klipsch. One reviewer mentioned that the ESPN analysts use these headphones which I confirmed after watching a few sports games so I was excited to get these. So lets get to the details.Sound = Wow, the delivery was very light. I listen to these headphones with no assisted power and with three different FiiO headphone amplifiers (E6, E7, &amp; E11). Those of you who are familiar with FiiO know that the E7 has two outputs that allow you to listen to two headphones at the same time. I also used the L3 &amp; L9 LOD connectors for my iPod. There is no comparison. The Klipsch has a fuller mid-range, richer bass, and slightly better highs. The Klipsch is also overall louder. For $200 headphones, I was expecting the Sennheiser to blow the Klipsch away but it was the other way around. I know Sennheiser enthusiasts with disagree, but don't comment until you compare both yourself. Trust me when I say that Klipsch is a better product. Is there a better Sennheiser model to compete with the Klipsch Image One? Probably, but at what cost. Once again Sennheiser HD25-1 II sales for $200 and the Klipsch Image One is averaging about $100.Quality = Its not the fact that the material is plastic, but its cheap plastic. Cheap looking and cheap feel to it. I actually thought I got a ripoff or bootleg model when I opened the box. I did however like the fact that the headphones came with interchangeable soft felt ear covers. I also prefer the durable cable quality of the Sennheiser over the Klipsch.Price = Well, you know where I'm going with this. A lot of people agree that Beats By Dre are overpriced. Really? Compared to the HD25-1 II the Beats By Dre are a steal. I can't justify buying these headphones based on my personal experience in both the sound and quality.Overall = Some reviews say that these headphones need a break-in period. There was no break-in requirement for the Klipsch. There is a positive to the Sennheiser HD25-1 II. It took a $200 hit to appreciate just how good the Klipsch Image One headphones are. The true deciding factor for me is when I used my FiiO E7 to listen to both pairs of headphones at the same time. The performance of the HD-1 II left me in denial. Once again Klipsch has made a believer out of me.
$review_summary.: Can't compare to Klipsch

$review_text.: Straight out of the box, I love it.  I ordered my Lenovo laptop (4330AU) over Thanksgiving weekend.  Paid $376 for it with free shipping.  Received in 3 business days.  I purposely did not want the latest and greatest computer, and looked for solid customer reviews before purchasing.  This is my 3rd laptop and, so far, after only using for one day, I like this one best.  For the money, I'm pleased.  Some of the little things I liked immediately included:  a 10-key pad; a textured surface that doesn't show finger prints (finally!); easy to setup with no added crap; fast; quick to connect to my home wi-fi; very nice screen (although seems just a tad bit smaller than stated size).  This laptop doesn't get hot like my old one, and the battery life appears to be as stated (4 hours) while running several websites and the wireless card.I plan to use this laptop mostly for internet, Microsoft Office, photo editing, PC games, etc.  Nothing serious.  If this laptop holds up even 1 year for me, it will be my best purchase ever!Updated 12/28/12I have had two cases where, after a long period of time idle, the screen blinks when a key is pressed. Makes it impossible to shut it down using the mouse, so I use task manager and keyboard commands.  After rebooting, the problem goes away.  Never experienced this type of issue before, and not sure if it's serious.  I plan to look into more over the weekend.  Other than that, still very happy with this laptop.

My old battery was completely dead, so anything would have been better.What I got was a no-name battery with a defective charge indicator.  It does not have any manufacturer name on it, and no "LB1 High Performance Pro Series" markings like the picture. I knocked off a star due to the battery indicator not working.  The indicator in the computer works fine, it is the indicator lights on the battery that don't work.When I first installed it, I noticed that it fit exactly like the OEM battery, which was a relief.  I have purchased no-name batteries before that needed work with a Dremel to latch in place.As shipped, it had 57% charge, which is very good.  A Li-Ion battery will last a very long time at about 1/2 charge.  It irks me when a battery is shipped almost dead, or fully charged, as that means that the battery has lost some life before it is even put in use.One thing that is slightly different is that, with the OEM battery, one can move the release, and then pull the battery out after letting go of the release.  With this battery, I have to hold the release until the battery has been removed.  This is a bit more awkward, but not bad.Battery life is great.  I am getting 6 hours of browsing with the screen turned down to half-brightness.  At full brightness, I get 6 hours.I will update as the battery ages, but I am currently very happy with it.

$review_text.: I was dealing with bad insomnia for the past few months, and my efforts to wake earlier (so I'd be tired enough to sleep earlier) were not helped by me constantly sleeping through my alarm. I was looking for a clock with a few specific functions: 1. It had to have a gradual wake feature, as the shock from normal alarm clocks always left me groggy in the morning, 2. It had to be able to use some kind of nature sound as the alarm, simply because it's more pleasant to wake up to those than it is to a beep, and 3. It had to be lit with cool blue LED lights, because this is less jarring to look at at night, and the blue is more soothing to look at than the normal red LEDs, which just look ugly to me.It was really impressed with how many sounds there were on the clock (20), I didn't expect it to have that many. I've never heard the earlier model so I can't comment if the clarity was better with those, but the sounds are fine to use as an alarm. They are definitely not clear enough to use as a sound machine or sound soother; there is a lot of noise, like the sounds were recorded through a cheap microphone, or possibly the speakers are cheap. But since I did not buy the alarm clock to listen to, and just use it as an alarm, it personally did not matter to me.Some of the sounds are also pretty clear. I like to use the wind chimes sound as my alarm, since it's a gentle way to wake up, and the sound clarity is better than some of the other sounds like the ocean or the brook.It's very easy and straightforward to navigate the clock menus and set up the alarm. You can also program 2 alarms, which is a nice bonus! And you can set each alarm to go off everyday, every weekday, or every weekend day. I was impressed with how many features the clock was programmed with.My insomnia is also a lot better now, and this clock looks great on my blue desk! It had an unobtrusive yet slick and modern design, and the numbers have 3 levels of brightness that are all aesthetically pleasing. There is also a daylight savings time button on the back of the clock, so you can adjust that with the flick of a finger instead of programming it through the clock buttons manually.I am happy with my purchase and glad I bought it despite the negative reviews. :) There really wasn't any other alarm clock on Amazon that fit my criteria, and if they did they cost over </review_text><review_summary>Works pretty good on Sony NEX-7</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3R0ZDQWANTOHM"><latest_review_date>04/05/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B003ELYQGG</product_id><review_date>04/05/2012</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>I heard good things about these earphones on ABI, and they did not disappoint
The sound reproduction has clean highs, a smooth midrange and tight, punchy bass
Overall feel is neutral, without exaggerated highs or muddy bass

I can hear instruments and reverb that would otherwise be obscured by cheap earphones


Just imagine hearing CD audio after listening to cassette tapes the whole time to get the idea

If you're still using the cheapo junk earphones typically bundled with an ipod, do yourself a favor and get these.

Yes they stayed in my ears but I couldnt leave them in for more than 3 minutes as when the cables bounce around they sound like a bass drum! BOOM BOOM BOOM.

$review_text.: These are excellent replacement pads. They are a bit stiff at the moment, but I'm expecting them to break in.A note: The easiest way to put these on your headphones is to essentially slide your finger up the rim behind the lip of the pad. I hooked the pad onto the bottom of one earphone, and held one side in place with my index finger, then slid my thumb up the rim with the fabric pad rim underneath it, effectively pushing the stitched edge around the rim. Quick fix.

$review_text.: I got this unit last week after doing research for more than 15 days


I moved from an old TomTom 300 to this latest gadget

I connected it to my computer and updated the software to latest version (not maps, maps are of Q3 2008).Here are the pros:First looks were very impressive and it took a while for me to understand it's features and options

Once I understood how it works, it's a breeze to operate and use

For the very first time I took it on road, it took almost 8 to 10 minutes to acquire a GPS signal and I thought it's a faulty unit

But once it picked up the 1st signal, it's very very fast


I switched it off and on several times and the signal is instant almost

Maps were accurate


It warns you several times before each turn and it knows exactly where you are on road

Highway lane guidence is excellent
It connected to my SonyEricsson phone and copied all contacts instantly

We even tried calling using bluetooth and voice clarity is not bad at all.Now some cons:The sound of speaker is not very loud and if your car sterio is on, you cannot almost hear the voice alerts (even in full speaker volume).Once in my 2 days of weekend usage, it guided me wrong.The screen is not very bright (may be because of our Arizona Sun :)).Other than these, I would recommend this unit to any one

This is the best out there in market for this price.-Sam.

They work readily with a Mac when one uses Time Machine.  I cannot stress enough that with Macs, one can generally have a better experience using Time Machine and not using the onboard Seagate software.These units keep getting smaller and run cooler and cooler.  The initial backup has always taken a long time for me - it's an overnight job, taking hours.  After that it can backup any number of times as needed, determined by Time Machine during the day.

I've also built countless external drives since the '90's and I can't understand why supplied software is being used. It's like a free download or a lite version of real backup software and most think you're supposed to use it but it's your choice.So I take the software and all files and put them into a new folder and keep it all but I've yet to use any of it. I use Teracopy (free download) to go back and forth with files and the Windows supplied software for backups and I have nothing to complain about and moving it to multiple computers it's always the same.So whether it's a drive like this or a USB flash or a 5 drive SCSI RAID give that copy of Windows you paid for a chance and use it's backup features, it can be a big advantage when using multiple computers. I'm just trying to help out those who complain about software, but don't really need it and I've always purchased backup drives so my info isn't in the cloud.

She apparently tried to prove that she has found the perfect "machine" and she did. I was TOLD to change my review because "I was unfair". I now agree that the functionality is perfect although cosmetic details were ignored by the Quality Control staff at the plant.Like I stated previously, The casting needed TLC &amp; cleaning especially around the adjusting screw. The threads were not cleaned so it took a while to properly assemble. I had to play dentist with my cleaning tools to clear the blocked threads from Aluminum and sand casting.The base can be made a bit larger to make device sturdy,Still, it is one of the nicest pieces on the market

Even moving it from one house to another required partial disassembly, and both pieces were mega-heavy.  Three factors went into our decision to shop for a new set:  We didn't want to move the old one again, save to load it onto a donation truck.  Second, although still functional, we were noticing some loss of contrast and fuzziness that no amount of convergence adjustment or cleaning could fix.Finally, Amazon's holiday 'Cyber-Week' discount pricing and combination bundle deals (3D accessory kit w/Alice 3D AND a 160GB 3D-capable PS3, both free) were way too good to pass up.So in my usual meticulous way I checked out all the offers of comparably-sized sets on Amazon, as well as reviews online, and I even made a trip to our local Costco to check out their display sets, so I could see for myself the difference between regular LCD, edge-lit LED LCD, plasma, and DLP televisions.  Of all of them, it seemed to me the Sony KDL-55NX810 blew the rest away, with only a few of the plasma models coming even close.  Between the Samsung and the Sony 3D set-ups there in the store, I felt the latter had the superior 3D effects and shutter glasses, plus overall the Sony looked to be the better quality.Unlike some folks who bought through Amazon, we had no problem with the Pilot freight shipping.  They arrived right within the scheduled time, unboxed the TV, attached it to its base and put it on the cabinet we already had set and ready for it.  I had done some prep work, and have a highly customized home theater set-up, so for testing I just took our older Sony blu-ray player and hooked it directly into the TV with an HDMI cable.  Having read here about some of the problems of dead sets on arrival or display issues, I'd decided it was only prudent to ensure proper functioning BEFORE the installers left.  There were no problems or issues in the TV itself; later I'd find some oddities with the HDMI connections which I now suspect were either cable and/or hand-shaking issues.Pros:- Beautiful, sharp, bright picture, with a high degree of customization possible for personal preference, room conditions, and even decent automatic adjustments based on what the TV thinks you're watching- 3D was even better than what I sampled in the store, although it does take a little getting used to.  Very nice with video games, and good with movies.  (We don't have DirecTV, so I can't comment on their 3D programming.)- Surprisingly wide viewing angles without any distortion or drop-off.- Integration with other Sony equipment is seamless, so much so that I sometimes have to check to remember whether I'm controlling the TV, or the PS3, or our older no-feature Sony blu-ray player.  The TV can even turn on/off and control the volume of our home theater receiver through the HDMI line.- No problem getting the TV to connect to our home wireless-N network, and the signal is strong enough to stream Netflix without interruption or quality down-stepping.  Nice feature about the NX810 is it has wireless and wired Ethernet built right in.- The provided Sony remote control is pretty nice and well laid out, but has no learning capabilities.  (I suspect my spouse is getting me a new universal remote for Christmas...).Cons:- Some HDMI set-up issues for us.  Our Denon receiver is supposed to be able to route full HDMI signals to the TV, and to support the latest HDMI standards (including 3D), but it doesn't -- TV says there's no signal.  So I connected all our equipment directly to the TV instead, and that helped, and I can get the receiver to work, but reliably only after I added an optical cable to serve as audio return -- which isn't supposed to be necessary either.  I've ordered a better/newer HDMI cable to see if this helps.  Meanwhile though, the TV does manage to control volume and power on/off for the receiver through the HDMI connection.  So I'm still puzzling this one out; if folks have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.- Didn't like the motion-flow default settings.  As other reviewers mentioned, while it might appeal to some, it tended to make TV shows and movies look weird and soap opera-ish.  No other way to describe it, just that it didn't seem natural.- As other reviewers have noted, the built-in speakers are rather weak, tinny, with little bass.  You can get better sound out of even a hundred dollar 2.1 computer speaker set.  Really Sony?  Why not include an inexpensive passive sub-woofer with the TV, and beef-up the built-in audio power and speakers just a little?  It's worth noting however that none of the thin-screen TVs I checked out had what I'd consider home-theater quality sound.- Internet video streaming does require a high-speed broadband connection.- There just aren't that many 3D movies out there yet, and a few of the high-demand ones are locked into ridiculously long exclusivity deals. (I'm looking at you Panasonic: Your reportedly year-long "Avatar" lock-in actually made me -less- likely to buy your product, not more, because I found the exclusion deal personally offensive, even though I really want to see that film in 3D again.)- The 3D glasses are somewhat on the heavy side, but this is the case with any shutter glasses.  When watching 3D movies, you might want to take breaks, at least until you get used to wearing them for extended periods.Recommendations:- Do have the location ready for when the installers arrive, that way you can have them set up the TV and you can really check to make sure the TV is working right.  Don't let them leave until you're certain you're satisfied with the TV.  Fact is though, no matter where you buy it, there can be problems during shipping and/or delivery.- Try to buy big-ticket items like this from stores and vendors with a no-hassle returns policy.  Amazon's is great, with 30 days to decide whether you like the TV or not, or to uncover product defects.- If you don't have an existing home theater audio set-up, I do recommend getting one of those powered TV speaker cabinet-stands they sell, or else a nice 2.1 Harmon-Kardin (or comparable) computer speaker set and hook those up to the TV, either through the audio out in the back or use the headphone jack.- If you have kids or rambunctious pets, absolutely do ensure the TV is either attached to the wall using a VESA-standard mount, or that the table-top mount is fastened/screwed to the supporting cabinet.  It's an important safety measure.- Check your HDMI cables.  Although older cables will usually work, there can be performance and feature issues with old or low speed ones.  It's essential to use a high speed cable between your 3D blu-ray player and the TV.  (Hint: Use the cable that comes with the 3D accessory kit for the 3D blu-ray to TV connection. It's guaranteed to work.)- Make sure to go through all the papers and fliers that come with the TV -- we discovered among them a number of unadvertised special promotion items, including several free PS3 3D games (free for download, enter a scratch-off code) and two bonus 3D blu-ray discs (Bolt (yay!) and Michael Jackson (meh)) just for registering our set online with Sony, plus subscription offers for Netflix, Hulu Plus, and more.Would we recommend this TV to a friend?  Yes, definitely.On edit, August 18 2011: Well, we've had the set for eight months now, and continue to be very happy with it. Nearly all of the audio problems I reported before were apparently HDMI cable-related, but here's the thing: I was always using the correctly rated cables. It's just that some work between one device and another, but move them to a different device and they don't. Or just never properly at all. Anyway, if you get audio cut-out problems or failure for devices to be recognized, my recommendation now is always "get another HDMI cable."

Screen covers fit perfectly; big enough to cover what they need to and not so big that they reach over the bevel of the edge and try to lift off (like some others do). The microfiber cloth included is high enough quality to actually assist in cleaning your screen, and not leave MORE particles than it brushes off (like some others do). The dust grabbing stickers are a nice touch as well. Another nice touch; actual helpful advice in the instructions. The idea of installing it in the bathroom after running a hot shower really helped cut down on all the floaties in the air that always ruin these things. Nice packaging; all around a quality product.

The two are very similar in design and features, enabling a direct comparison. In all features the Vanguard is superior: the smoothness and precision of the adjustment mechanisms (main focus, individual right-eye focus, inter-pupillary distance, the ease and precision of adjustment of the twist-up eyecups), image-edge sharpness, and the quality of the carrying strap and the case. The Celestron&amp;#8217;s right-eye adjustment is particularly stiff and hard to use. So how do the Celestron binoculars rate five-stars? I paid exactly one-quarter as much for them as I did for the Vanguards. In this lowest price bracket for quality binoculars I have 5 pairs from a variety of manufacturers, and the Celestrons are the best I have owned. Celestron also makes binoculars in the higher price ranges, but these Outland X models are worth considering as a good choice in a modest price range.

$review_text.: This was a gift for my hubby who needed a light for his Kindle.  He has found it to be very handy because it is so small and easy to carry just about everywhere.  In fact we bought several as gifts for friends and they all love them also.  This ins a great accessory for just about anyone who reads and doesn't want to bother others when reading in the dark.

I have a Canon AS 590 IS bought through Amazon which takes excellent photographs, but it only has a 4X zoom. I take indoor, outdoor, low light, wildlife pictures and pictures for a local flea market. I wanted a longer zoom for the wildlife pictures that the Canon could not reach.I looked at cameras with a 10X to 30X zoom from $150 to $400 and read all the customer reviews and all the professional reviews. The pro reviews usually showed pictures taken at full zoom which was very helpful. Any camera I saw in the stated price range has a slight softening to a horrible softening at full telephoto.Last Saturday I was disappointed with all of them for the long zoom shots. I saw a sale flyer for this Panasonic DMC-FH25 at $99, so I looked on Amazon and reviews were extremely favorable. I found a pro review and the zoom shots were the best I had seen. I decided to buy the camera, figuring if nothing else, the zoom was worth $99.I have used the camera all week long and it has been equal or better to my beloved Canon and the zoom is as good as advertized. I have an old oak tree 100 yards behind the house and with the E Zoom button I focused and shot the picture. The photo came out so well I can see the bark pattern on the tree.The camera is very easy to use and with the IA mode (Intelligent Auto) I did not have to do anything but press the shutter button (after pressing half way down to allow the auto focus to lock) and the pictures are great. So far it is the best $99 I have ever spent.Pros: Super easy using IA mode and excellent results (sharp pics)E Zoom one touch button uses 8X optical zoom and digital zoom to make 18x with no visable picture degradation.Exposure levels can be changed by pressing one button on back of the camera. This is great for getting the right exposure on a white flower under a bright sun.LCD on back can be set so you can hold the camera up over your head and still see the screen. This is great if you are behind a crowd but want to take a picture of an event.Quick menu button enables you to make menu changes on the fly to improve light compensation filters.It is super easy shifting from stills to movie mode at 720p. And movies look very good.Battery life is very good. It ran for hours while I accustomed myself with camera features. Battery comes out easily and recharges in an external supplied charger.Camera is very small, yet feels good and looks great.LCD screen has modes to adjust for taking pictures in bright light.Party mode takes great indoor low light pictures.Cons: No manual focus, but then the auto focus works very well.Battery takes over two hours to recharge from a complete drain.Movie mode files are .MOV and need to be converted to .WMV for Windows Media Player. There are ways if you search on the Internet.Software that comes with the camera for picure handling was barely adequate. I just use my Canon software instead.So far those are the only drawbacks. I will update if I find more things good or bad.Update 4-17-2012 The battery is easy to remove and reinstall. It takes just under 2 hours to recharge from zero. The battery and SDcard cover is just a slide on off so no worry about it breaking the plastic. The battery is good for 200 pictures without flash and indoor pictures are good without flash under normal daytime conditions. You can take all your pictures using IA mode if you care to do so. Macro pictures are great. AF Zoom allows you to take a macro from 3 feet away. Indoor pictures usually snap at 400 ISO without a lot of noise. I have posted some pictures taken today on my blog at [...]/ You can judge for yourself.

We recently had an old desktop with 2 hard drives die due to blown capacitors on the motherboard, and although I had backed up my own data well, not all members of my family had planned ahead so well. This device let us access our files on the hard drives and transfer them to the newer computer(s). We can also use the old hard drives for backup as well ... in particular, home video takes a ton of space, so it's a decent way to archive things like that.From a security perspective, holding on to your old hard drives (or at least being able to overwrite them with zeros for security before re-using them for non-sensitive info like home video &amp; pictures) is a lot wiser than just throwing it in the trash or recycling it as is.It's great that it works for both 3.5 and 2.5 inch drives (haven't tested the latter), and is backward compatible to USB 2.0 (which I have verified).I have two minor quibbles. One, the drive tends to go to sleep after a not very long period of inactivity. It comes back quickly enough, though. Two, and this is probably more the fault of the OS on the recovered hard drives(WinXP SP3), when I was trying to recover files from other users, I was denied access repeatedly even though I had been the sole administrator, and no one's user login required a password. I had to manually re-assign &amp;#34;ownership&amp;#34; of the directories and subdirectories to get at the files and recover them. This got to be tedious - but it's not likely the fault of this product. It's just something you may have to deal with when using this product.I probably won't leave it lying around plugged in, but it sure is a nice &amp;#34;insurance policy&amp;#34; to have if your computer dies but your hard drive is OK.

I hate reading instructions, but the instruction manuel with this camera is simple and reads very fast.

I wanted it for its compactness and portability, and I am certainly not disappointed on either of those considerations.  This netbook is awesome for taking on an airplane or to the coffee shop.  The battery lasts about 4 hours, which is more than enough for my typical usage.  The keyboard is at 85% size, which I am able to adjust to without too much trouble.  I like that the mouse buttons are in the normal locations.  The biggest complaint about the keyboard is the apostrophe key being out of place.  Even after almost a year of constant usage, I still have to hunt for that key, and I am a better-than-average typist.  Every now and then it runs slowly because of memory size.  Those are my two complaints, BOTH of which I believe are resolved in the new Dell Mini 10.  A 92% keyboard with all the keys in the right place, and a 120 or 160 gig harddrive.  I wish I had waited, but at the same time I am very happy with this and use it almost exclusively.  I use it for word processing, email and internet, powerpoint presentations, photo editing, etc.  I am overall very happy with it, but think I would be happier still with the mini 10.

$REVIEW.: I have so many of those HUGE plugs at my computer
Between the Printer, Scanner, Hard Drives, and Cordless Phone among other things..

I would always have to unplug something to use something else! I had THREE of the regular 6-Outlet Strips but if I would plug in 2 of these enormous plugs, I wouldn't be able to access the other 4 outlets
What a waste of an entire strip!The swivels allow me to alternate them in such a way that I can plug in 2 BIG plugs and 2 SMALL plugs side-by-side!BIG, small, BIG, small..


and I don't lose a single outlet! If you play around with it, I'm sure you'll be able to position all your plugs in such a way that all the outlets get utilized! It's compact and I don't have that cobweb mess anymore under my desk when I had to use a million strips for my bulky plugs!

$review_text.: I bought a Panasonic TV from Best Buy  (TC L 32X ) It was almost 100 dollars more expensive than I purchased from Amazon.I'm not complaining, Best buy gave me valuable information about the ports I needed to accommodate the devices (4 in all ) and they supplied an information booth to answer any puzzling problem I may have


Enough o that.I had a problem in trying to find out how to connect my external amplifier to this TV


 I finally found out that Panasonic has only one port and it is digital and I needed Analog


This product gives the solution to that problem

I ordered it from Amazon and along with the proper cables (not supplied) and come with a package deal from Amazon solved my problem

 The output analog from this device hooked up to my amplifier is not controllable from the TV

 I can recommend this product for anyone who bought the Panasonic TV listed above

$REVIEW.: This system is good for home.  You are not going to get a great picture, however it does the job. The cameras are not 700tvl but the system can support up to 700. Ensure you get the proper HD to work with this. I used the 2TB purple western digital HD and it works perfectly. 2TB is the largest you can place on these units. Also, do not mount the HD to the case because the DVR will overheat and cause problems quick. I assume I was missing my HD brackets and fabricated my own to lift it a bit. The Zmodo customer service was great on Chat and help me resolve some minor issues. You will have 4 microphone inputs on this as well. This is a great feature and requires additional cables. You do not have many options or motion detection so you will be recording bushes moving. Hope this helps.

I had a 52" Samsung LCD that was too expensive to fix.While the picture quality is as-good-as, I had to supplement the TV with a soundbar/subwoofer HT-CT150 combo to achieve sufficient sound quality and volume.Only 2x10W speakers is a joke for a LCD TV where there is plenty of space for big speakers and amplifier components.  I can understand how slim LED TV's having underpowered audio due to size limitations.  I guess LCD's are a dying breed and they give them the same lame audio drivers until they completely go away.== Pros ==55" Screen.Great picture quality.Handsome appearance.Bravia works good with other Sony components.Wide mode enables viewing 4:3 input signals full-screen with less stretching.Input/output including PC, component, and digital optical audio.USB for pictures, video, music, thought limited formats.Packaged really well and easy to setup.Easy menus.== Cons ==Horribly weak sound.Anti-reflective screen SPREADS light reflections and actually makes it HARDER to view the picture.Wobbly stand: Set acts like a pendulum side-to-side if bumped.No Audio Return Channel (Doesn't send audio via HDMI to a theater system).Only 2 HDMI inputs, no S-Video input.No backlighting on the remote controlSlow to startup when turned on.TV cannot change HDMI inputs on the Sony Theater system, despite both being Bravia and syncing correctly.Thin owner's manual.For the way I use a TV, I am satisfied with my warranty replacement TV.  Based on my multiple bad experiences with Samsung, I am extremely glad to have a Sony-branded product.If I was purchasing a TV for myself, I would NOT go with the traditional LCD with CCFL (fluorescent) backlighting, I would definitely spring for LED backlighting.  I would need to buy an external audio system either way.

It's a stand, case, and locks your iPad when closed
My only gripe is the corners that hold the case to the iPad have a tendency to crack or break
I'm on my second case, and the same thing is happening.

$review_text.: I upgraded from an old wireless g router and I saw a huge boost in my speeds compared to my old router

I upgraded my internet to 50 down and 5 up (Through TWC)

In my home I run 1 top line gaming rig, 2 Macbook Pros with wireless AC, 2 iPhones, 1 Asus laptop, 3 various tablets, and a HTPC computer running Plex


I do a lot of streaming through my network locally to devices from my HTPC server that is running Plex Media Server


The speed is amazing and haven't had any problems with the fast AC and N speeds especially to my MBP.Wireless-N:The wireless N is only rated at 450Mbps compared to the ac68U


However, all my devices on wireless N are super fast and utilize the bandwidth the N provides.Wireless-AC:Due to only having 2 MBPs utilizing the wireless AC, I can attest to the reliability of the AC connection and the speeds when streaming and transferring large files between computers and to the USB drive I connected to the router

Transferring a 4gb file is lightning fast when utilizing AC


The 66U's 1300Mbps AC speed is fully utilized by my tasks and can't wait to see how a higher speed in the future will run.Pros:-Simple and intricate UI for administrators.-Set up a separate 'guest' wireless to limit guests' access to and within your network.-Easy setup within minutes!-Firmware updates can be done within the actual admin console and is fast and easy to do

Just click update and sit back and relax!-Range is by far one of my favorite perks

In a 2 story apartment this unit can connect to devices that are 3 apartments away (around 30ft through brick and metal)!-Reliability is top notch and haven't had any issues with drops or intermittent signal.-USB 2.0 ports are very useful and allowed me to create my own 'cloud' that can sync to my tablets, phones, and computers

Connecting a USB drive to one of the two USB ports will allow you to create your own NAS for easy storage and retrieving.-Functionality is high with this router


Within the admin UI, you can set up your own personal cloud, media servers, and more! The cloud is by far my favorite function since i've maxed out my Dropbox account with files and needed my own cheaper way to store files and make them accessible whenever I need them.-Price: The price at the moment is a steal for a high end AC router

$review_text.: I have a 24" iMac that came with 1Gig of memory. After using it for about 3 months I discover applications that crash for reasons unknown after an upgrade to the OSX Tiger upgrade. I concluded after looking into the problem that OSX has a problem with memory management. When all the memory gets used up by either leaky programs or a fault in the OS, applications get flaky. So I've increased my memory to 4Gig. Now the applications aren't crashing. So this was my fix for a bigger problem nobody seems to understand. The memory took 5 mins to install and worked perfectly. And it seemed incredibly well priced.

$review_text.: I love this camera. I would rather have the 10 MP version, but I got this as a gift. It's really slim, and the battery charges in less than an hour and stays full for weeks. I use my camera almost everyday. I like all the photo options, and they all work really well. The manual and software/cords are all great. The only thing I don't really like is the battery charger. I think if it had a retractable plug, instead of a detachable cord, it would be better. Everything else about this is great. The picture quality is also great.

It's so small I can take it everywhere--and I do. With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.  But I really don't need to.All in all, the C3030 is an excellent Camera.  The number of settings and menus is, at first, a bit daunting.  But spending some time to get to know the camera really unlocks its full potential.If you want an excellent digital camera, with excellent image quality, easy to use default settings, and advanced features for even more flexibility, the C3030 is the one to get.

No deleting after upload or managing files such as moving naming

This case does do a reasonably good job at protecting my tablet, but it has two fatal flaws.1. The case must be open to charge the device. No idea why they didn't just put another cut-out in the bottom of the case for the cable, and while this may seem like a small issue, it because more and more annoying as time went on.2. The case stays closed using magnets. Great idea. Small problem, the magent has managed to wear it's way through the microfiber lining of the case and is slowly scratching a hole in the screen protector. To me, this is a fatal flaw and would make me want to return the case if I could. I can't recommend that you buy this product, and I'm currently shopping for a replacement.

A perfect fit for my Canon EOS T3i mounted to a 55-250mm lens.  Plenty of pockets for my accessories.

I also like the water proof base (even though I would never set it in wet environment) that allows the bag to stand up for easy access.  The only negative is that I wish the shoulder padding was a little thicker and had a little better gripping material.  Still, was not enough for me to rate this any less than 5 stars.

What it does do is make a tremendous improvement from your stock laptop speakers.  Like someone else mentioned I was skeptical because of the tiny size. It's about the diameter of a can of red bull. I'm planning on using it to run video loops and casual listening to internet radio while working.  If I wanted to do audio editing I'd use a set of monitors.  I love the fact that it is rechargable.  I don't have to burn through batteries.  It really is suprisingly loud with a decent sound field.  I'm tempted to do a little haking to see if i can get too into a stereo setup.  For the price I've never heard something this good.  15 bucks or so...go for it.  Just don't think you're going to get earth shattering bass.  It's the size of a salt shaker for goodness sakes.  But it holds up great!

There is a strain relief at the transformer body (good),  but this is also the failure point and it not easy to repair.  It would be better if both this and the AC cable were separate, plug-in items, but that would probably raise the price of the unit.

$REVIEW.: I like this bag, it has a lot of space for all my stuff. Good back pack design! The only thing I would say I don't like it the inside barriers for the lens/camera are not as sturdy as  would like them. They fold in on each other and get Camera spot makes it top heavy so it tips over all the time when you sit it down.

$REVIEW.: I am not sure why this has gotten some bad reviews. For $16 this set is terrific! I was apprehensive after reading reviews about the crimper not working - but I have not had any problems at all with the crimper. Everything lines up, it works as it should and I have had no issues. And for those that have said it's flimsy, I disagree, I've used other name brands like Klein and this one is right up there for the price.. PS - the tester comes in a nice, protective black zippered bag.

I think the layout of the outputs around the hub is a bit awkward and they should have simply put them in the front.

</review_text><review_summary>* If you're a reader: YES. The Retina Display makes reading books and comics much easier on the eyes (although I still prefer e-ink for long stretches or reading outdoors).* If you're a gamer: YES. The Retina Display, better speaker, and new gyroscope/accelerometer make gaming better.* If you're a social networking freak: YES. The video camera, still camera, built-in microphone, and Face Time are a social networking fan's wet dream.* If you're looking for a PDA: NO. It doesn't really matter unless you want to take advantage of the video camera for business meetings, or have bad eyes and want your address book to look more crisp. You could probably get by with the 3rd Gen, but honestly, you're probably already using iPhone 4 so this is a non-issue.* If you're looking for a portable web browser and mail client: YES. If you're on the Internet a lot, you'll appreciate the Retina Display and better WiFi reception from 802.11n.* If you just want to play music: NO. Don't bother to upgrade because the music/iPod functions aren't all that different from the previous generation, unless you want the convenience of the built-in microphone for voice commands.* If you just want to play videos: YES. The higher resolution and Retina Diplay make videos much better, and the ability to output 720p is a great feature for videophiles.Final verdict: For most users, the newer model is a much better value. Apple improved the iPod touch enough this time around to make it worth grabbing the 4th Gen, even if you do end up paying a little more for it than a clearance-model 3rd Gen.</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3U1Z3RGCFY6I1"><latest_review_date>13/02/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0028Y4F4S</product_id><review_date>13/02/2014</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>REALLY</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3U2RZHI34HHON"><latest_review_date>06/04/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0047PNLUU</product_id><review_date>06/04/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>Magellan tells you that you have arrived then reads and displays the address that you have which I like. My old unit does not do this and I sometimes have to check my note or go back to previous screen to check the house number.10. Satellite signal: Satellite reception if fast. First boot took me around 20 seconds to acquire signal. It is usually the same when I have to turn off the unit and turn it on again on a different location. If you turn on the machine on the same location you turned it off, you usually get signal in a couple of seconds. My Garmin takes at least 3 minutes or at least a minute if turned on the same location.11. POI search: Fast when you use the category option as it first narrows down the select to location near you (around 5 mile radius). It then gives you option to expand the search if you want a longer radius. When you use the spell name, it takes at least a minute or 2 depending on what you are searching.12. Display arrangement: I like the garmin screen better, you can easily see your direction, speed, and ETA. You will have to toggle through the display selection on the lower left from Magellan if you want to see these option. Maybe I got use to seeing all those option from the last 2 1/2 years that I am using garmin that is why I continue to look at those data. If you only use Magellan or if this is your first GPS, you will not notice the difference.One thing I noticed is that when I first enter an address outside the city where I first used it, it does not show me the range of number that I want. It shows 3250-8000 when I need a 3007 number. When I use the POI (the address is for a business) it shows the 3007 address. After I select the POI and create the route to that address, I tried entering the address again manually and it was there and available. The range increase from 3250-8000 to 1-8000. When I looked over online I saw on one page (I don't have the link anymore) where it says that when you enter a new location and could not find the address, you can first create a route on that city by selecting the city center from POI then all the address range will be available. It looks to me that it is a bug and this is a workaround. So, far I was not able to replicate that problem. Also, I have upgraded my firmware and map after I experience that problem so the update may have fixed it.I will continue to put this unit to test and if it works as expected, I will add the traffic link cord to also get the traffic reports.Conclusion:  I cannot attest to the durability of the unit as of this time as I only have it for the week but for the price, I recommend this product. The directions are clear and it will take you to the address you tell it to go. The screen may be hard to see but the spoken direction is clear enough for me that I don't look at the screen anyway. Another thing is that I have put a protective screen on my Garmin. This may have also reduce the glare from the sun. I will try installing a protective screen on this unit and see if that will make the screen more viewable.

$REVIEW.: This is my first external battery pack for mobile devices and I'm very pleased with it so far.I have an original iPad, iPhone 5, and a Google Nexus 7 I intend to use this with.The device came almost fully charged...3 of the 4 LEDs were lit and the 4th flashing, it did not take long to complete the charge with my wall charger and the provided USB cable, maybe 2 hours tops.  It does take a LONG time to fully charge this battery packAfter it was fully charged, I used it to charge my Nexus 7, which was at 3%.  I wanted to see how it would charge while I used my Nexus...it did NOT...I actually slipped down to 2% while surfing the web and playing around with some apps for a few minutes.  I then closed all my apps but the Kindle app and was able to read(with brightness down) and charge at the same time.  Seems like heavy use of the tablet will eat up all your charge power and drain the battery more, but with just the Kindle app running I was able to charge while reading.It took over 10 hours to fully charge my Nexus 7, altho I was using it for 45 minutes or so during that time which will make it take longer to charge...After the Nexus charged, the Anker was down to 1 full LED and 1 flashing LED...so the tablet, as expected, did a good job taking all my juice, but I still had enough to fully charge my iPhone.  The iPhone charged overnight so I'm not sure how long it took.  NOTE:  The iPhone, unlike the tablet, still charged even when I was using it extensively.It only comes with 1 micro USB cable, and does NOT come with a wall charger, you will need to provide your own charger and cables for anything other than micro USB.I have not tested charging 2 devices at once, but will try to do so and follow up in my review.Comes with a handy carrying pouch.Its HEAVY, very dense.The included cable is not very long, maybe 2 feet.

I was doing nothing out of the ordinary, just pulled out my phone when standing in line at the bank, when I saw a notification on my phone saying that SD card is damaged and needs to be removed or reset, or something along those lines.  But I did not want to do that because then I would lose everything, not that it mattered, because I lost everything anyways.So I ignored the warning, but that didn't do anything at all.  So then I decided to restart my phone, thinking maybe it was just an error with the phone, or the phone was just acting a little crackers (crazy).  That didn't work either, as the warning again came up onto the screen and was there till stay, at least until I tried the option that it was giving...restarting the damaged card.  So I gave in and did just that, and lost everything on the card and the card went dead.  It was inside the phone, but the phone was not picking it up and registering it as a working card.So basically I was just out of luck and could nothing about it, and could not retrieve the pictures and whatever else I had on the card.  I don't know what when wrong, but from now on I am backing everything up and making sure this does not happen again, as you can imagine that i was not very happy with the situation.But all was not bad with the product...I did like the card before it decided to quit working, and I am sure that this does not happen to everyone, but I got the (un)lucky draw.

$REVIEW.: For the price, this monitor can't be beat! 24 inches, super bright LED back light, continuous even light distribution, and 5ms refresh. I would certainly get this monitor again. The front panel controls are pretty easy to figure out and use, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to navigate the menu system. 1 opens / exits, 2 selects, up and down navigate. Pressing 2 without being in the menu attempts to switch to the other input.

My Logitech mouse history includes the standard three button mouse, the MX 500, the G7 and the M500.  The M500 is a corded mouse and it's still working great, but the MX 500 had charging issues and the G7's left mouse button doesn't work very well anymore.  I decided to give the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 a try and so far, it's pretty good.Installation:Installation was very easy and I didn't even need to install the Microsoft software for it.  I just plugged in the receiver stick and waited while Windows XP detected and installed drivers for a new "human interface device".Build quality:It's a solid mouse, as you would expect from Microsoft.  I find the construction comparable to that of Logitech mice.  The top part of the mouse, including the buttons, are made of a glossy plastic.  The scroll wheel seems to also be a plastic wheel with a rubbery outer cover for grip.  The sides and back of the mouse are covered in a nice, textured, rubbery material.  Overall, the construction feels very solid and seems to be of excellent quality.Ergonomics:The mouse design is symmetrical so it's good for lefties too.  The sides of the mouse are indented slightly where your thumb rests, but I find that the indents are too far forward.  Perhaps I have short thumbs, but I find that my thumb rests at the edge of the indent, rather than inside it.  This also means that I have to reach a little to press the side button, which is located directly above the indent.Coming from a right-handed ergonomic mouse, it feels like my ring and pinky fingers are just dangling on the side of the mouse.  Also, my ring finger sits right on top of the right-side button and I've accidentally clicked it a few times when picking up the mouse to reposition it.The scroll wheel doesn't click like those on most other mice.  It rotates smoothly, but there's a slight resistance that makes it's feel controlled and usable.  Logitech has an option in their newer mice that allows the wheel to spin freely if you give it a hard flick, but the resistance on this wheel makes that impossible.  I was a little worried that I wouldn't like the scroll wheel, but it actually works just fine for me when scrolling through pages of source code.Precision:The mouse tracks a little differently from my previous mouse, but it took me just a few minutes to adjust.  After getting used it, the tracking feels just as sharp as any laser mouse that I've used in the past.  I had to turn down the sensitivity a few notches when I plugged in the Wireless 5000, which might be a good sign to those who like their cursors to be extra responsive.I tried the mouse on a variety of surfaces and it worked perfectly for most of them.  It worked great on my laminate wooden desk top, a black cloth gaming mousepad, on my jeans, on the plaster wall, and on non-glare picture frame glass.  It jumped a bit when I tried it on regular picture frame glass so those with very shiny glass desks might still have a bit of trouble with this mouse.Overall, the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 is a solid buy for anyone who wants a basic, wireless mouse.  Also, mine doesn't glow blue like in the photo, but I actually prefer it like this.

$REVIEW.: It fits wonderfully on my 5-year-old's tablet, and provides protection that you just can't beat!  She has dropped it multiple times with this cover on - face down, back down, on a corner...  It doesn't matter how she drops it, this case saves it every time!  We also have one for my 8-year-old's Samsung tablet, and just ordered one for my 10-year-old's new Samsung tablet (he won't be able to have the tablet until this cover gets here).  The cover lines up perfectly to allow access to the ports.  We got some princess wall stickers for it, and turned it into a character tablet cover (the stickers have stayed on for a couple months and show no sign of coming off).Now if they could just make one for my 7-year-old's Nook...

For most, 3tb should be more than enough, and can probably be used for multiple backups.I don't trust external drives for more than backups, but this should provide a great solution for those of you looking to backup your files and documents.

$review_text.: I've been using this to record personal music events, and it works very nicely. U can record the whole show, then later go back and evaluate how I did by listening to the recorder. While it is mainly meant for voice recording, it works fine for recording music (though no stereo support exists).It is able to act as a pass-through by puttting it in record/pause mode while the record source is set to "audio in". Very handy for checking levels, making sure it's actually going to record the correct sound source, etc. (This is only useful if you plan on bypassing the builtin mic.)All in alal a very handy device, and welll worth the purchase price.

$REVIEW.: I heard great things about this flash so I decided to try one out. I have a Sony Nex-6 and plan on getting a Sony A7. I also had a sony 58am and just sold my 43am. I was using the sony flash with a hotshoe adapter. This flash is fully manual and can also be triggered by on camera flash. The problem I was having with the sony flash is they all overheat and while this does not happen to me often, there are times I need to use some power and that makes the sony overheat very fast. I was going to get the new 60m multi shoe sony flash but it cost almost 500.00 and from what everyone is saying it overheats worse than any sony flash ever made. This flash cost me about 60.00 and save me tons of money. The new 60m flash has a gn of 60 and this 58 so they are very close in power output for a fraction of the cost. The build quality is actually pretty decent and does not feel overly cheap. I just purchased another one I love it so much. I may even replace my nikon sb-28's with a few of these. I will miss the ttl features of the sony flash but to be honest, I don't find much if any difficulty with shooting manual at all. After a while you just kinda know what setting to put it on. I also shoot raw and tend to over expose just a little. I find that editing them later the pics come out more to my liking than if they were under exposed or just right. This just goes to show what I always believed and that is photography equipment is grossly overpriced hence a certain person selling a piece of plastic for 80.00 for example. I also forgot to mention there is no lock on this flash head which make it easy to switch from portrait to landscape, makes me not miss my sony flash excellent quick bounce feature as much. You can also use this flash with any other sony camera with the old minolta shoe with a simple adapter. Overall excellent flash so far.

Why? Because since it's made to be universal, it has a handy easel that props up any tablet or phone while your're typing then flips down to cover the keyboard when not in use. This makes it easy to stow in a backpack or other case for whenever you need to pull it out and use it, whether for tablet, phone, or iPad. I have an iPad, and I often found that the drawbacks of having a bulkier keyboard case always attached to my tablet often outweighed its convenience. With a separate keyboard with a built in easel, I think you get the best of both worlds.

It is also very durable.  My wife wanted to help mow the lawn recently and she wanted to listen to music like I normally do so I let her use the Sansa and it fell out of her pocket and she ran over it with the riding lawn mower!  After searching for a while, I found it buried in the ground with tire tracks across the back of it.  Fearing the worst, I dug it out and it was still playing and didn't have a crack or anything on it.  It was just a little dirty, but I haven't had any problems out of it even after that abuse!Pros:- Low Price- Ability to hold thousands of songs, as well as, videos and pictures- Very intuitive to load songs using Windows Media Player.  I'm sure you can use other programs, but Media Player works great for me.- Screen is large, bright and colorful.Cons:- There is no power indicator so if you hit the power button by accident, like when it's in your pocket, you have no way of knowing that it is on.  I've done this a couple of times and only knew it was on because I hit the volume button causing the screen to "wake up".- The volume control is kind of flimsy feeling and is very sensitive.  I've been listening with the player in my pocket and when I pull it out of my pocket, I almost always cause the volume to go up or down.  This can cause quite a shock to your ears when you turn the volume up full blast without meaning to.- You can't delete pictures and video from the player.  You have to connect it to your computer and go into the file menu on the computer to delete them.  You can delete songs from the player though.- The earphones that come with the player are really too short to be useful for me.  If I tried to carry the player in my pocket the earphones would pull out of my ears so I bought another pair fairly quickly.So, for me, the pros outweigh the few cons that this player has.  I would easily recommend this player for anyone looking for a great MP3 player at a great price.

$REVIEW.: I was using a PAC RP5 unit for my 2011 Silverado.  Even after updating to the latest firmware, the dang thing's built-in steering wheel controls would just not work.  I decided to spend even more money on ridiculous interface adapters and tray this.  Holy cow what a difference!  I was about to ditch my head unit but this saved its guts.  My steering wheel controls work almost perfectly and the unit sensed my vehicle and head unit without issue.  The firmware I received was already the latest.Finally someone makes an interface that actually works.  Now here's to hoping it doesn't burn up on me... just my luck.

If you owned an iPad 2 or earlier model their dongles no longer will work because they changed the connector.  I tried the camera connector, beware that one--if your camera doesn't output enough juice the iPad won't be able to import photos from it--so this media card reader is your best bet.  Getting tired of the planned obsolesce here, but if you want to get photos onto your iPad other than acquiring them with the crappy iPad camera or wifi, this is your only option.

$review_text.: Historically I've had pretty good experiences with the Targus brand.  I've been using this Targus docking station for about a month and it's worked well for me.  Really the main thing I use a docking station for is being about to easily connect my laptop to a bigger monitor while at my desk.  I've also got some USB charging stuff plugged into the docking station.First off I read some of the reader inputs on this docking station so the first thing I did was update the drivers.  I'm using standard Wintel setup with a fairly new Dell laptop.  I've had no problems docking my Dell and using the larger docked monitor and USB ports.In terms of build quality this Targus seems good.  My biggest pro is the form factor - smaller than some docking stations I've used in the past.  At $120 the price is a bit high considering you might be able to get your OEM docking station for similar price range (but won't be as usable across multiple computers).  So overall I rate this 4-stars in consideration of price/value.  A bit pricey but small form factor is nice and ability to potentially use across multiple pc's is nice.

$review_text.: I like the clear window, although the paper stock is pretty thin and absorbs moisture in humid environments like when I'm working on pc's out in the shop.  They dry out eventually.  Now I have used half of them to protect my CD's.  I even ran them through the printer to put product keys on them and they worked ok for that (on the back of the sleeve).

$REVIEW.: This is only a few dollars more than the cheap external cases and it's much, much better. Nice, though thin, metal case. Decent foot unit. Drive plugged right in and the unit went together easily. Case and covers fit and match well. Everything needed, including a small Philips screwdriver is included in the package.

This is one of the most disappointing products I have ever purchased. The unit crashes every few weeks for no obvious reason (you really want your NAS to never crash).

Disk transfers are so slow I gave up on using it for backups. I keep hoping that a firmware change will fix things - so far 4.0.4.14600 is still not helping.I loved the idea of this device - really unhappy with the results.

Its power adapter carries a current of 3 Amp which is plenty to support a couple of external hard drives

However, the AC adapter end (the small one) that goes to this device is rather lose and it comes off unplugged occasionally when the device is moved around or the power cord is touched

When that happens my PC will not recognize the hard drive
This is quite disappointing.Update 6/29/2012This device has been working just fine for 14 months with occasional failures due to lose mini-USB port/plug and power port/plug
I had to tape both cables to secure them to the hub

Once that was done, no more failures had occurred


The vendor was quite generous and sent me a newer version yesterday at no charge
I tested the new device and verified both power plug/port and mini USB port/plug are tight and secure

 The cables are also longer which can further prevent accidental unplug if the hub is moved

This vendor apparently has demonstrated its commitment to customer satisfaction based on its customers feedback.

The player is dead quiet -- little whisper of a wind up whine, but basically silent once it gets going. Wireless networking is finally built in (not a dongle), and the connection to my home PC happened with the click of a (remote) button.Amazon's house brand HDMI cablesare working without a hitch, but again, I've yet to play 3D content with them.Now, the cautionary part. I bought mine open box, and whoever had it before me registered NetFlix. I was stuck with their Dora the Explorer-themed queue, and it actually takes a call to NetFlix to deregister it. Can't just hit the reset button. And, believe it or not, NetFlix doesn't do customer support stuff like this over email (at least, that's what I was able to decipher -- I hope I'm wrong, but don't think so). So if you're planning on grabbing one of these as a return from Amazon's WarehouseDeals.com, just expect a little extra difficulty getting up and running.Samsung has a whole slew of their really sexy, beautiful 2011 'D'-series players coming out now and in the next couple months, but I just feel more confident with this (relatively) solid feeling Sony player sitting on the shelf. Sony's user interface may be a little conservative and lack pizazz,  but Samsung's flashiness is already getting knocked for Netflix bugs and promised operating system updates.Edit 4/7: After talking a little smack about the 2010 Samsung players, and seeing the Sony S580 price dip to the $150 price point, I (1) returned my $200 open-box S580 to Best Buy due mainly to the Netflix issue I mentioned with the intention of buying a sealed unit from Amazon, but then (2) had the opportunity to check out Samsung's 2011 units. I ended up purchasing a 2011 Samsung BD-D6700 from Amazon... I wrote a bunch about this decision (and the ordeal surrounding this seemingly simple DVD player purchase) below, in the comments to this review, in response to Ty Harden's (largely justified) criticism of my inability to make up my mind. It may be worth your time to read, especially if you're thinking of upgrading just the DVD player but using an older TV or receiver.</review_summary></review><review><product_id>B00F6E8OUS</product_id><review_date>07/08/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Mouse only review</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3VZNZCEZXYK7R"><latest_review_date>16/09/2010</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B000M4LXIW</product_id><review_date>16/09/2010</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>fit is excellent.  sound is lacking</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3W152L0OZZER6"><latest_review_date>14/03/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00004VXNI</product_id><review_date>14/03/2012</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>not for me.</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3W1GWLJC3PLX9"><latest_review_date>16/10/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B0040702HA</product_id><review_date>16/10/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Perfect Solution</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3W1YBQ1DBBT2U"><latest_review_date>20/01/2012</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00CDIK908</product_id><review_date>20/01/2012</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Disfunctional</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3W3UTHG7S73BI"><latest_review_date>16/07/2014</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004O0TRD8</product_id><review_date>16/07/2014</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Great case!!</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="A3W42GDZOBARMS"><latest_review_date>13/07/2010</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B00BGDA0CI</product_id><review_date>13/07/2010</review_date><review_helpful>[1, 1]</review_helpful><review_text>For the price and quality, the coby dvd-224 is a good choice for the kitchen, garage or someplace where a dvd player would be convenient, but not your primary system


 I really don't need a dvd player in my kitchen, but given the price of this unit, I felt that the convenience was worth it.Basically - don't expect much
It's a lightweight unit with mediocre playback quality and functionality


And I think that's fair, given the budget pricing


 If what you want is a basic functional player - as a backup or for a rarely-used location, then this model will do just fine


 I've probably used this about a dozen times, with no problems


 If I had been planning on racking up hundreds of hours on it, I would have bought a better model.For casual use in a non-primary setting, this is fine


 That's pretty much what my review is:  This is ok


 Nothing special, but functionally fine.

It is bright, light and very easy to use. I pair it with a Cannon T3I and it works perfect. It is so much brighter than you almost ever need, I have only had it at max a couple of times. I usually only use the frost filter for it but the other ones are handy if you need them. I use the Maximalpower SON NP-F550 Battery and it fits perfect and last a long time. Don't even think about it, get this for your gear, actually grab a couple.Overall I would recommend this to anyone who films or takes any amount of pictures.

$REVIEW.: Loved this fan because it is light and compact enough to fit in my laptop bag

However, when dust gets in there its pretty much impossible to clean out

So use a compressed gas duster every couple of days to keep the vents clean


The base has legs which pop out and clip back in, but even when in, the shape is curved
So it doesn't fit flat in your laptop bag


Make sure to have the space for it.

$review_text.: I purchased the NE-700x to replace my 5 yr old Shure E3 that had finally wore out.  I understand there will be a justified difference in quality considering the difference in price.  These were bought for my bike commute to work.Use - At first glance I thought they looked cool.  I like the plug on them, and liked the cable until I used them for a while.  The cable is not very pliable.  It wants to stay in the shape of the way it was packaged, and I found it awkward to wrap and store when not in use.  When unwrapping the cable was difficult to untangle.  This is a minor inconvenience.Sound - My first impression was good.  There is significantly more low end than the E3s and many other in-ears I have used, including E5s.  I enjoy the low end in most music I listen to so I did appreciate this however I found it incongruous that they would be marketed as "Audiophile-Grade."  These definitely color the low end.  The high end is clear and precise but seems lacking possibly due to the excited low end.  I would not use these for monitoring mixes, however they sounded great for my commute.Comfort - I found them a bit difficult to keep them in my ears.  The large sleeves were uncomfortable to me, and the triple flange lacked stability to be inserted consistently.  I used the medium sleeves.  I did not feel I could insert the earphones in deep enough to get a good tight fit that held itself in as I did with E3s.  They did feel very lightweight and comfortable when they were in, but I felt I was constantly adjusting them.The most unfortunate quality of the NE-700x is the build quality.  I have had them for about 5 weeks and the right side has stopped working.  I treat them relatively well and believe that this problem occurred because at work I walk with one earphone in, mainly the right.  Because of this the cable then gets the weight of the left on it and while I do wear the cable over my ear, this is the only conclusion I could come to.

It does have a few drawbacks, but for when you know you'll be in bright sunlight, this definitely works to allow you to frame your subject and combined with the camera's peaking function, you can verify focus pretty well.  Unlike some of the other reviews, I like how the magnets break-away easily -- better that it drop off than put unnecessary force on the camera in the event of a hard knock or fall.This are the main negatives as I see it:- It doesn't collapse/fold, so it's a bit bulky (considering the small size of the camera).  It's another thing to carry around.- The lens isn't great quality, with lots of CA, so when I reviewed photos to see if they came out OK, it was sometimes hard to tell.- It uses magnets.  Another reviewer says that it damaged one of his lenses.  You probably need to store and handle this seprately from any lenses or anything that can be affected by magnets.It's a great value for the price, and it is very useful for certain situations.  It was very helpful in the outdoor event that I used it in.Great value!  Recommended, as long as you can work around its quirks.

$REVIEW.: This latest generation of APU chips from AMD provides stellar performance at a very reasonable price.  This APU was put into a new build desktop, for me, that is a Win 7 Home Premium unit with 16 gig of memory, a 120 gig SSD for the boot and software drive and a Seagate 2T hard drive for storage.  Very fast and very dependable.  The graphics with this APU look excellent on a 27&amp;#34; monitor.

I haven't experienced any issues whatsoever playing back Bluray disks. Boot times are very good with the disks I tested. Everything played back perfectly with stunning picture quality. However, I really purchased this player for its streaming abilities. Sony players were dinged in the past for a poor Netflix experience. Sony have fixed this with a updated Netflix interface that supports 1080p and Dolby Digital+ streams. Similarly Amazon VOD supports Dolby Digital bitstream audio, and VUDU and HULU+ are unchanged from the 2011 players, but work fine. Its also nice to have "crackle" on there so you can watch the odd Seinfeld episode when you fancy.I also tested the player with a DNLA server. Sony seem to recommend Serviio (free) so I think they must test the DLNA features of the player with this software. I tested photos, music and video and everything played back perfectly.Anyway, a great streamer/disk player. Highly recommended !!** update **Had a need to play a Disney BD disk on this player the other day. A comment here suggests that Disney BDs won't play. Complete nonsense. They playback perfectly.** Update (8/27/12) **Sony added support for watch lists with the amazon Vod app.Cinema NOW is now supported.

They are far better than any of the other ear buds I've ever tried.  I'm very impressed with these little guys; and as someone with ridiculously sensitive skin and tender ears I'm happily surprised at how comfortable these are.  They come with several sizes of soft-squishy material so you can find the right fit for your ears.  I use them primarily for playing Skyrim and listening to Pandora, both of which require a certain sensitivity and clarity of sound to get the most out of and these ear buds deliver on all counts.

 Hear everything...when they're in
 The physical design is not very good


 Simply lying in the bath tub, water seeps in and sound is lost as ears are filled with water


 Then they're totally dislodged.I don't know what the excess plastic &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; are for, but they and those bulbous outer parts are a hindrance to a secure fit
 The buds do not seal the water out as they basically sit at my ears versus fitting IN my ears
 They can't with those big outer parts.Had a five dollar pair of iHip waterproofs that lasted like two years and never had this problem


 The iHips actually fit IN THE EAR not at the edge of my ears, so water never got in.

$review_text.: Very good motherboard for a very good price


I was upgrading the RAID-5 array in my media server (from 4 x 500GB to 4 x 1.5TB), but it turns out my old Asus P5D motherboard's ICH7R RAID controller could only support a 2TB volume size, so I needed a motherboard with a newer RAID chipset
This motherboard includes an ICH10R controller (now called the Series 4 by Intel)
The LGA 775 socket allowed me to transfer my old Pentium D 820 to this motherboard, but when a Q6600 came available from another system, I dropped that in instead.I have 2 x 1024 DIMM's and 2 x 2048 DIMM's for a total of 6GB RAM
Note that due to some stability issues, Corsair (the memory manufacturer) had me increase the voltage to the memory and the memory controller


They said that was because they design the memory for 2-stick installation, and the 4 sticks draw more power
The increase solved my stability issues.Because I now had 6GB of RAM (I only had 2GB before), I needed to go to a 64-bit O/S
Windows 7 x64 installed perfectly with no additional drivers needed


That was sweet.Because of the stability issues, I haven't overclocked yet
To tell the truth, it's a media and data server, and I really don't want any data corruption, so even if I do overclock this puppy, I won't be aggressive.The only issue I have with the motherboard is the substandard video controller


If you get this motherboard, I suggest you also get a nice $75 video card with 1GB of RAM - that'll let you run Aero, and your performance will be better.

$REVIEW.: 2-11-14 UpdateI  have had the replacement for a week and it works fine. It came from a different vendor (GMartGlobal still no short 3.5 cord or band) but it works as well as the first one. I had the local guy jack out my car audio, and now I can plug the amp right into the radio without the phone rigamarole ,,,1-31 UpdateIt quit working. Amazon will accept a return,,, I will tell you how the replacement fares,,,,I am virtually deaf and while they are trying to figure out a path forward after my cancer surgery, I am desperate not to loose something that has been important to me for sixty years - my love of music.  I have a set of Sennheiser wireless headphones that i use for tv, and some Bose headphones for music and JLab buds for portable situations but I just couldn't get enough volume out of them in most applications.I read the reviews of this amplifier and figured I would give it a try, and am I glad i did. I am able to hear again, at least for the devices I can plug inline to this FiiO miracle.  Nice set  of controls, and the equalizer helps too. I am not an audiophile so I can't be precise in my description of the features other than say they work.There must be some irony in all of this.  As i drive down to road listening to XM  on my phone  because I can't hear the receiver in the car, with the output of the phone running into this device and the output to the JLab buds.I do have several concerns, primarily that you can' listen and charge at the same time. I charge it at night and don't start using it most days til the afternoon as I have been averaging about 8 hrs on a full charge.  Also the vendor I purchased from  (HiFiMan) did not ship either the short 3.5 mm cable or the little rubber band discussed in some of the reviews.  It's not the end of the world as we know it,,, because at least I can hear again.

There is absolutely NO excuse for not having your cards on you at all times as a wedding shooter.  I've heard horror stories of card cases falling out of luggage, being stolen with gear bags, etc.  That's why you strap them on you.  You can replace gear. You can't replace once in a lifetime images.This case is easy to use and makes card management a breeze.  I put fresh cards facing up, and used cards I flip around so I can tell at a glance how many cards I've burned through and which ones I have left.  The little strap that comes with it can be hooked to a belt loop.  (The plastic fastener on the strap isn't the best, I suggest upgrading it by switching to a carabiner.)My partner swore by using the CF card holders in his lens bag until he tried my pixel pocket out, and then he wouldn't return it to me!  So now we have two.  The other thing I love is the business card holder.  Shooting events, I don't really have time to return to my camera bag to give a card out if someone asks for one.  It's nice to just have a few on me at all times.I do have two issues with it that keep me from giving it 5 stars.  The velcro is LOUD, especially if you are trying to discretely switch cards in a church during a ceremony.  I have to remember to take an extra card out ahead of time and keep it loose in my pocket, which I don't like doing.  I would LOVE an option with a silent fastener.Secondly, when fully loaded to capacity with CF cards and a small pinch of, say, five business cards - it barely closes.  I wish it was just a little bit roomier, because I almost always have it filled to capacity. It will close, but it's a tight fit.Less important, but I wish there were more colors available.  We'd probably buy an assortment of these in different colors to manage cards.  We own a LOT of cards, so we can do 2 or 3 days of back-to-back weddings and not have to dump cards.  It would be great to load up 3 pixel pockets in different colors and just be able to quickly grab and go and know which is which.

$REVIEW.: My daughter saw a video of these speakers and quickly became obsessed with getting a pair. The first set arrived with a crack in one of the speakers, causing all the water to leak out. Returned those and promptly received a new pair in good working order. The sound quality is what you would expect from a pair of gimmick speakers: poor. However, they do look cool, if the lights are off, and my daughter is pretty pleased with them. Not for audiophiles, which may be obvious, but they are good, cheap fun, particularly for kids. My daughter has had hers for three months now, since Christmas, and so far they are still going.

$REVIEW.: The product description states it's compatible with a wireless G router. Well, it didn't work for me. I have been working in I.T&gt; for over 10 years so I am qualified to set up a router. In fact, anyone should be able to set up this router based on how it's supposed to work. You are supposed to be able to insert the install CD, plug in the Extender and follow the prompts of the installer. Not only wouldn't the extender install, it caused my PCs to keep dropping the connections. I spent WAY to much time on this. After a couple hours I decided to pack it in and send it back. Amazon was great in the return process. No hassle. Quick refund. The return process was the best part of the experience. In my humble opinion, I don't think that this product is compatible with a "G" router.

There is some noticable hiss during quiet music. The remote seems to be a waste; it works, but so what. Maybe if somebody in the back seat wants to use it. Actually, the kids don't; they want to plug their mp3 players into it instead. On the whole, recommended for cars that don't have an mp3 plug or cassette.

$REVIEW.: There was only one review that somebody used it in Panasonic GH2 camera, so I thought that I should add this one, just in case if the owners of this camera are searching for related reviews.After inserting the card into the camera I had to agree with a question for reformatting the card, which is normal. It seems that Panasonic GH2 has reformatted it with exFAT because Win7 is showing that. It is also showing that the capacity is at 61.8GB, which is also normal. Actually this space is more than I expected, since after formatting you usually lose almost 10% of the space.My Panasonic GH2 is estimating that this card would be enough to fit 6 hours and 22 minutes of HBR (24 Mbits/s) video. So far I've just taped 30 minutes and it is still working and hopefully will continue in the same manner. If there will be hiccups I'll immediately return to Amazon with an updated review and will take off some stars.Reading from the card, while copying to the PC, averaged at 19.6 MB/s. Writing to the card (the same data) has averaged 15.7 MB/s. See pictures and captions for details. I get the same performance from my SanDisk 32GB SDHC Extreme HD VideoSanDisk Extreme SD 32  GB SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDX-032Gcard that claims "up to 30 MB/s" transfer speeds. I don't use fancy tests. Instead, I use daily footage so it's all down to earth, without any illusions about performance.One will have difficult time believing that an unknown company, such as KomputerBay is able to deliver memory cards on the same level as SanDisk, Transcend, or Kingston. The only couple explanations that I can find are:a) a necessity of one of these companies to offload overproduction of a certain modelb) or some batches of the cards have not met strict quality requirements. Maybe this batch had 4 bad cards out of every 100 comparing to the expected 1 bad card for each 1,000?The card, that I've received, did not have the country of origin on it. Since my recent SanDisk 32GB SDHC Extreme HD Video (30 MB/s claimed) card was made in China, so I thought that by purchasing KomputerBay the risks would be similar.The Amazon listing stated "Lifetime warranty" but since the card has not arrived with any extensive packaging (except a white label, see a photo) it is not clear how the warranty can be claimed, if the card will stop working in a few months.One more note. Both of my recent cards (SanDisk and KomputerBay) have a strange nuance. If the video files have been written by the camera, then the average reading speed is at 19.6 MB/s. But if the same files were written by the PC, the reading speed, while copying these files back to the PC, averages at 150 MB/s. It seems that there is a substantial difference between how Win7 and Panasonic GH2 write data to both cards, hence a jump in the reading speed. By the way, defragmenting data, written by the camera, does not improve the reading speed.Hopefully other reviewers will provide more details about the cameras and devices where they use this card, so there is less anxiety. It is especially appreciated when people post reviews and updates after a few months of using memory cards. Thank you!UPDATE from April 7th, 2012:During last few days the cards started to act up. Five days ago, GH2 during the same video session, stated (suddenly, after four-five video clips) something about the insufficient speed of the card and stopped videotaping. I had to reinsert the card in order to continue. Then, today, while watching footage on Panasonic BD45 Blu-ray player, the playing suddenly stopped. I've been copying the files after each video session, but at the same time not moving them, in order to make sure that the entire capacity of the card is usable. Well, only half the card (38GB) is filled so far and these problems are already apparent. Also, after the problem in the player, I continued using the card in the camera, and again, after a few clips, the camera reported "insufficient speed of the card" and stopped recording the video. Re-inserting the card eventually helped.If one compares this card with similar cards from SanDisk and Kingston, one can notice that this card is THINNER and the contacts are sitting DEEPER in the plastic. After scrutinizing the appearance of the contacts it is possible to notice that they are shiny/glossy and have less scratches on them from insertion/reinsertion than the cards from the above mentioned brands. I am not an expert, but logic tells me that such contacts will have less chance to stay tight to the contacts of the digital devices, hence more chance for a trouble.This card got my five stars when I've purchased it and tested six weeks ago. Now I am downgrading it to one star for being UNRELIABLE and forcing consumers to spend money again for purchasing something that can hold in the field. No wonder why the price has dropped by 10% during last few weeks! With more time on the market, more consumers will discover the long-term non-lasting quality of the card and the more the company will be interested to get rid of the current stock as fast as possible.The card has not failed completely yet and I will continue filling it (while making backup copies of the content on regular basis) with videos up to its maximum. However, if you are looking for a card for traveling, where you will not be able to copy to the computer on regular basis, consider SanDisk or something else. Yes, they are priced 150% higher than this card, but sometimes you can catch them on sale for almost the same price as this card. Just be patient.UPDATE from April 8th, 2012:In the middle of the video recording the camera again showed a message about insufficient speed. After reinserting the card, the GH2 could not recognize the card at all. And, of course, the return window has expired a week ago, but I was still able to get 80% refund. I love you Amazon! Will shop again, but not for this brand. I guess I'll stick with SanDisk, Kingston, and Transcend, unless they will develop as many problems as KomputerBay.UPDATE from April 23rd, 2012:One more thing... I've recalled that after having more than half the card filled with videos, the startup time of the camera and the recording time after stopping video recording has noticeable increased. I am not sure whether it was happening due to the quality of the card or due to the volume of the recorded data, or due to the capacity of the card... When I had to switch back to 8GB Transcend and 32GB SanDisk, it seems that the startup and and the "finish recording" lag quite noticeably shortened. However, I don't have 64GB SDXC from another brand (yet) in order to compare objectively.

It's great to be able to tilt &amp; pan.  The built-in software is fine for use with your computer's browser(s) but I really like using TinyCam Monitor Free with my Smart Phone and Tablets.  I wish there was a version for browsers.The only issue I've had is that from time-to-time it can't be accessed.  Some times a power down/power up will fix it and once I had to use some basic DOS commands from my Windows 8 computer to get it going.  Usually it will come back to life on its own but it's disconcerting if you're relying on the cam for remote viewing and you can't reach it.The mounting bracket give you lots of mounting options.  I didn't have any issues setting up the Cam with my router with Port Forwarding but I have better-than-usual computer skills.In all, even with the occasional dropouts, based on the price/performance ratio I give it 4 stars and may purchase more units in the future.

In an attempt to lure buyers into the ML sound, the company has tuned these phones to have perfectly clear, articulated treble that is non-fatiguing. This is hard to do, especially in a headphone, so kudos to ML for that.However, the treble magic comes at the expense of bass, which is minimizied to an unnaturally sounding level. Even symphonic music sounds enervated and hollow, especially older ADD stuff. The new digital recording of Mahler's 9th by Dudamel and the LAPO sounded good enough, and the added detail in strings really made me spot new and interesting elements in Mahler's composition. But then I put on Levine's Brahms symphonies, and they sounded like the bass section was in a different auditorium. Pop and rock sounded even weirder. But acoustic guitar and piano pieces were incredible!Moral of the story; unless you collect headphones, or listen to nothing but acoustic music, these are probably not going to be a good choice. As an alternative to the gobs of bass slathered all over most modern portable headphone tuning, these are a refreshing concept, but most popular music needs more bass than the Mikros 90s offer in order to sound even reasonably close to the recording artist's intent.ML ruins even a qualified recommendation in my case by the fit issue. I have a large head, hat size L, and these barely fit. When crushed down on my ears, the small and oddly shaped driver pads create immense pressure, and the precarious balance of the drivers perched on my ears make them likely to shift into uncomfortable and / or worse sounding positions easily. Definitely not for the big headed. The close fit does at least create considerable isolation from outside noise, but the cord is very microphonic so too much motion when wearing these produces a slighly distracting rustling noise.Making matters worse, the fit and finish on my new M90s was uneven, as the arms racheted out only with a lot of forceful tugging, and one of the arms had some sticky glue or paste on it. Unacceptable for any new headphones, let alone one intended to be a "luxury" model.I'm not taking any stars off for the build quality, as that might have been an anomaly, and I did like the generous accessory kit, especially the compact hard carrying case.The first pair of sub-$150 portable headphones you get should be either neutral (Brainwaves HM5 say) or somewhat bass heavy (e.g. ATH M50) depending on your listening preference. The second pair you get should be whichever of the first two you didn't get, and then if you want a radically different sounding third set, the ML Mikros 90s would be a fine choice, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into. This collection of three headphones will still cost less than the Sennheiser Momentums, will sound better than the ordinary sounding Momentuns across the board (the M50s and HM5s in all ways, the M90s in treble), and will give you some interesting ways to customize your listening.If it was just a question of sound profile, this UnCola of headphones would get 4 stars from me (as long as one is not looking for an all-rounder) but the fit and comfort caused me to take another star off. If you love Segovia and Chopin and little else, and also have a smallish head, these might be worth five stars to you.

It is wide, but it is also on the tallish side. Some computer desks may not be compatible with the height. I put shelving in my office before the iMac G5 was announced, and wouldn't you know it - the shelves were installed ONE inch too low. So, double-check your clearances before you bring this monster home.2. The SuperDrive has ate everything I have ever thrown at it - DVD+r, -r, you name it. So, there are only two considerations on how to feed the beast - money, and time. The iMac doesn't seem to mind cheap or expensive disks, but sometimes cheap quality disks take longer to burn. So if you want to go a little cheaper on disks, be prepared to give up some time.3. Burnin' rubber. Yep, this is a G5. Would you buy a Corvette to have it sit there and idle? Nosireebob. So the first thing you are going to do when you plug in and boot this bad boy is open the System Preferences, and click on Energy Saver. Click on the options tab and down on the left you are going to click on the pull-down menu next to where it says "processor performance". Set this menu to "Highest" and never look back. I haven't noticed the fan noise is atrocious, and I seem to be free of all problems I hear about other iMac G5 owners who keep their computers on "Automatic".4. Take every opportunity to make your PC-usin' friends drool. They pretend not to like your Mac, but trust me - on the inside they are eatin' their ever-lovin' hearts out. Do they have anything in their universe even remotely this cool? Nope, and they never will. Plus, they still have to wait nearly 18 months for "Vista"!5. Three words - killer surround sound. You now have what may be the most killer computer in the known universe, don't botch it now with cheap speakers or (GASP!) running with the internal speakers. Get thee and thine hence and purchase thee mighty, thundering speakers with wattage that bespeaks the power of God! Trust me, you don't want to watch movies on this big, beautiful, extra gi-nourmous widescreen and listen to the built-in speakers. It ruins the effect, and how. Speakers are like cars - there is no such thing as too much power.So let's recap - measure twice, feed the beast decent disks, warp speed Scotty, rub it in, and crank it a notch or thirty past 11. Do these things, and the iMac G5 will leave a smile on your face a mortican can't erase.

$review_text.: I bought this after reading about it on cnet as a good way to protect the iPad 2's backside if using the Smart Cover.  As far as installation goes, if you've ever used protectors like Zagg Invisible Shield, it's exactly the same process -- clean surfaces thoroughly before application, douse your fingers and the shield with the application fluid (seriously, be liberal with it), and work under good lighting to make sure you can see any dirt/dust particles that might fall on the surface.  I found the installation video on Bodyguardz.com helpful in order to get the corners on the backside to lie flat -- you have to wait 10-15 minutes after application and then press the corners down (on the video it says to use your palm -- I found it worked way better just using your thumb/fingers), then the corners will stick and lie flat.So far I think it's a better value than the Zagg because it has the same quality feel and thickness at a much lower price (at least when I got it).  I think the texture is a little less sticky/rubbery than the Zagg, which makes for smoother swiping across the iPad.I gave it 4-stars because ultimately I prefer the Splash Masque (I have that on our 1st gen iPad) and its no-fluid/static cling application, which is a lot less fussy and involved, and offers the same protection in my opinion (at least for what we do with our iPads).  However, I needed something for the backside that worked with the Smart Cover and would retain the nice sleek look of the iPad 2.  This certainly fits the bill, although it would be nice if they sold it just for the backside.
$review_summary.: Good value; watch the installation video

$review_text.: I love my iPad. I try to us it in place of my laptop whenever possible.  I have tried several other case/keyboard combos and didn&amp;#8217;t like the bulk they added, or the smaller sized keys.  This is not a case for your iPad, rather it&amp;#8217;s a case for the full size Apple Bluetooth keyboard. It snaps into the case, the case folds to cover the keyboard.  When you&amp;#8217;re ready to use it, it folds into a stand you can set your iPad on and type away.  I have a small messenger bag I carry and it the case and keyboard don&amp;#8217;t take up very much room. When I need to type a more than I want to deal with on the onscreen keyboard I just whip it out.The things I like most about it.1. You don&amp;#8217;t have a bulky case for your iPad, you can use about what ever case you want since it just props the iPad up, I have a iPad Air, and use the new apple leather case for it and its fine.2. Then I have a full size keyboard. I can type fairly fast.  Using the miniaturized keyboards, it was difficult and frustrating to keep my speed up and then deal with all the typos. Having the full size keyboard is great.

$REVIEW.: The optics are pretty dece for the price, and the size makes it very pocketable. I unfortunately opted to use the carabineer so I hope someone is enjoying my scope. All that was left was the 'bineer. It was clipped inside my jacket so I can't imagine it took a lot of stress but it failed at the first link. I know I shouldn't take away too much for a little defect, but since I was using it in a way consistent with its construction, and then lost it I feel like it deserves it. =(

$REVIEW.: I purchased this camera over 3 years ago and I was immediately impressed with it.  The picture quality was great and it was small enough that I could put it in my pocket.  That is how I typically carried it too, but always somewhat protected inside a thick soft case which was designed for eyeglasses.  This camera has gone on many trips with me, either as a backup to a DSLR or for trips where I wanted to travel light.  While the results are obviously not as good as my DSLR, but compared to other compact cameras that my friends and family have used, this one had better autofocus and better image quality.  Unfortunately after my last trip this summer the camera simply stopped working.  The lens only pops slightly out when it is turned on, there is an error message, and I have to manually push the lens back in when I turn it off.  If it was still working I would have given this 5 stars, but I have to detract one due to it's lack of durability.

Lack of original packaging indicates counterfeit product or an open item.  The card would not work as it was not recognized by two seperate computers.  It also heated up to over 100 degrees before I removed it from my computers to prevent damage.  Yes, I measured the temperature with a guage after I noticed the the card was hot to the touch.  The product is being returned.  Do not purchase this product, the $19.99 deal is not worth it.  Pay the full price for a brand name from a reputable dealer who will provide the product in its original packaging.

$REVIEW.: I used &amp;#34;EaseUS Todo backup&amp;#34; which was a free download and it completed with no problems.. after cloning it i installed it a primary harddrive without the other drive installed once it booted and it found itself a c: drive.. i then shutdown and installed the old harddrive as a secondary which it then allocated it as d: and then I just format it. Its booting up much faster and all the programs are starting up fast even Mozilla..

While I was able to easily connect to the bluetooth speakers with my iPhone 5, I am, unfortunately, disappointed that I cannot make the same connection with my iPad 2. The iPad 2 cannot find the bluetooth JBL Speakers.....very ugly and frustrating!!

$review_text.: I got these cases at a time when I couldn't afford a really expensive case that offered the best protection for my iPod Touch. These cases fit my iPod very snug, and with a screen protector they did offer good protection for my iPod. I recently dropped my iPod, and I feared that the screen was ruined, but after picking it up there wasn't a scratch on it. I would recommend these cases for anyone looking for a cheap temporary case for their iPod Touch.

Everything worked but after a couple sessions, video preview stopped working.  I could always control camera, but the video preview window never displayed live video after the first day.  After powering off camera, ipod, running app on iPod mini, trying all sorts of reset procedures,  just gave up and had Amazon send me a second unit.I'm updating firmware on this second unit and will advise.The biggest issue I have with the GoPro iOS app is you can't access pictures in SD card.  Had to purchase 3rd party app for $1.99 to download pics from camera to iPod / iPad - and this app requires GoPro App to be on and connected.  So why doesn't GoPro include that feature.  Streaming live video from camera is MUCH harder than downloading images from SD card.  Don't get it.Lets hope this camera works better.----- Update -------------After getting second camera (I love Amazon customer service), video preview works on same iPod and iPad mini.  So the only thing that changed was the camera.  This leads me to believe either the original camera had a hardware issue - OR - the firmware controlling the camera has a bug.  If the problem comes back, then its the latter.  Stay tuned - its only been 1 hour with the new camera.

$review_text.: I read the multiple negative reviews. The product is thin, flexible, light weight. However, it is advertised as a &amp;#34;Travel Cover.&amp;#34;I have a heavier cover for daily use. It is thicker, has the magnet, and provides a lot of protection with the added benefit of allowing me to support the tablet in many positions.What this item does is allow for screen protection with minimum weight and effect on the tablet. It is thin, lightweight, and protects the screen. When I travel it allows me to slip the table in my pocket without any added bulk. With the other protector, it is much thicker and does provide a larger &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; during use.For my  Samsung S3 I have two covers. One that is for daily use. Plus, a very thin,, minimum protection for putting in a suit pocket.So, for a tablet I have a high protection cover and this one for travel.It is not the cover I would get for all uses. However, for what I needed, it is fine.So, if looking for something to protect the screen, minimal weight and added bulk. this is it.If you want something to allow you to prop up the tablet for reading and more screen protection, try the-Blason The New Nexus 7 2 FHD (2nd Generation) Auto Wake / Sleep [Slim Book] Stand Case CoverMy significant negative is why they couldn't have put a simple magnet for auto wake/sleep.

$REVIEW.: These shielded cables do a great job

I have them running near a 4 gauge power cable and get no feedback at all
Most of the install the power and audio are separate for most of the run but at the end for about a foot or two the power and audio overlap


I was worried about feed back but have not had any problems with that


These cables are also long enough to run from the front of a toyota 4 runner to the back with extra cable to move speaker and amp around
I would highly recommend these wires to anyone very happy with product.

They excel with regard to comfort - the ear padding is plush and they have a nice balance between grip (e.g., staying put when you move) and comfort. The headband consists of 2 plastic rods without any padding, but doesn't cause a significant comfort issue.I had zero problems pairing these with a couple of different tablets (Android operating system and the Fire version of Android). Simple, quick and painless. The operating range is also excellent, with zero dropouts at about 20 feet and only minor dropouts at 25+ feet.The sound quality is quite good. While these open-ear designs don't have the booming bass quality of closed designs, I found the sound quality to be very good, especially in the midrange. They are an excellent choice for movie watching since the dialogue comes through so clearly.I like the operating controls, especially the volume switch. It's a rocker-type design, so it's very easy to use without having to look at the button - just find it by feel, and press up to increase volume and down to decrease. The multifunction button is in the middle of the rocker switch and is very easy to find by touch as well.The overall look is very snazzy, and the build quality appears solid.There is only a modest amount of sound isolation, but that again is an issue inherent with open-ear headphones. It does cut ambient sound reasonably well - I had no problems listening to music while on a noisy treadmill without the ambient sound interfering to any significant degree.Misses are the volume level. These have a rather limited upper volume range. Normally I set my tablet to about the 75% level and the headphone level to close to the upper point to get a good volume that blocks out ambient noise. With these, however, I had to set the tablet sound level to 100% and the earphone level also at 100%, and I still found them a bit lacking in volume. Given the price point, the range should be better.But other than the volume issue, no complaints. Good sound, good comfort, great range and easy-to-use controls. Well worth considering.[Sample provided for review]

$review_text.: I'm not going to claim I'm a technological genius, but neither am I a technological noob. I've had universal remote controls before, so I know how to program them. At the very least, I know how to follow instructions. So, I was very surprised when I followed the instructions to the letter with both of the remotes in this pack, and neither worked. I tried at least half a dozen times to program either to work with my Visio TV, my Dish Network and my Zenith DVD player. Nothing. Finally, when I did the opposite of what the instructions said, i.e., I started with my TV OFF instead of ON, at least one of the remotes...the six device remote...finally worked. However, I never could program it to work with my Dish device, nor did it work with my Zenith DVD player. Although, when I was trying to get it to work with my Zenith DVD player (and yes, I had the device on, had pushed the DVD button, and had entered in the correct code), it started turning on and off my Vizio TV. Go figure. The three device remote never did work with any of my equipment.Now, to be fair, I do have a 2 TV Dish DVR. So, the one DVR works two separate TVs. This could have been the problem as to why the device would not work with my Dish. However, having said that, my setup is one that is very common, and when the manual for the remotes says it works with Dish Network, I'm just going to assume they've thought about this situation, and made their devices to work with this setup. Clearly, they did not. Or if they did, it isn't as "Simple" as they would like me to believe. If these aren't compatible with 2 TV Dish DVR devices, I would have really liked to have known that. It should be very clearly stated in the manual, and I didn't see that anywhere. So, I'm just going to assume it's an oversight. Though....it's a pretty big oversight, IMHO.I would have loved to have these work, and if I ever get them to work, I will amend my review, but for now, it's one star.

$REVIEW.: I just got my "Kindle Fire" today (11-16-2011)... I bought the Leather Case a week or so ago, wanting to have something to wrap around the "Fire" when it showed up... I looked through pages of cases on Amazon.com and just didn't want to spend a whole lot of money... Found this one, great price and free shipping... I bought it and hoped for the best... Well It fits the 'Fire' fine and looks great too... I'm very happy with the purchase.

The materials seem burly and the padding is adequate. But the drawstring top is almost impossible to open or close. It's made of stiff nylon with a very stretchy pull cord. Just to get the cord to slide through the casing in order to open the lid far enough to get a camera in was a comedy routine: I had to squeeze the stiff, burly cordlock through the too-wide rigid nylon webbing that 'protects' it with one hand, pull one side of the top open with the other hand, and try to pull the other side down with my foot. The last few inches to fully open took a few more minutes of coaxing the soft cord into the hard casing. To close it again was even harder -- the cord stretches rather than sliding through the rigid casing.This makes the lid both useless for protection and hard to get out of the way for use. Even if you somehow closed it, the gap in the center would be wide enough to let in dust or water. A soft panel lid that folded back and closed with a zipper or velcro tab would work; this doesn't.In addition, the two chubby dividers are stiffer than the ends of the box. They don't help it hold its shape. When I put in a DSLR and 4" lens, the box becomes football-shaped and bows out on the sides. You have to wonder if anyone at Mountainsmith ever tried this bag.I can fold the top down over the outside of the cube and hope my messenger bag stays closed. But I can't recommend this item.

$REVIEW.: Great cover for the ipad mini. Very slim, good color but i wish they had more color options. With the cover on, it can also fit into a case that i bought here on Amazon ( STM Jacket D7 Padded Case for iPad mini, Nook, Fire, Galaxy and 7-inch .....). Very pleased with this product. My only concern is that its difficult to keep the iPad mini in a horizontal position. But with these case and their design, its always going to be a challenge.

Got it after rave reviews from several sites
Panasonic seemed to have had issues with some TV sizes and batch dates


THX was off
The screen had a greenish cast


Panasonic did fix this with firmware updates

But before that, there was a lot of internet chatter and many owners were pissed
Some of us (myself incld) calibrated the set and it looked good after that
These were calibration offsets that were not correctly set at the factory

Had they been color decoding issues behind it, we would not be able to fix it till Panny fixed that in the firmware.The set worked great for the first 1000 hrs

Then, the infamous black level hit

Google it and find out for yourself.I'm not sure if the 2011 line up has Kuro tech and/or some other tech that will not ramp the initialization voltage like it does for this set

Doing that increases the MLL (min luminance) and affects your (real) contrast as perceived by the eye.Panny came out with some stupid infinite black nonsense
This only worked in vivid mode and if no pixel was being addressed


Only then would the entire screen turn off.The plus with Panny is they build very reliable products that do not fail (stop working)
The newer sets seem pretty good


However, unless there are enough data points with actual consumer usage, I'd be wary of initial reviews


Many of us who got the 50" got burned

I think the 54" and larger sizes seemed to exhibit less of the black level issue.

$review_text.: The ADVC110 from Canopus is a great little device that lets you import all your old analog video into your computer.Once you connect this device to your computer via the FireWire cable it is seen as a standard FireWire device and is treated just as if you had connected your modern camcorder to the computer


Within your video editing program you capture video just as you would normally, except that instead of the capture program being able to control playback you will need to manually start the playback on your source device (VHS VCR, 8mm camcorder, etc.).Connecting the unit is easy
Simply plug your analog source into the standard RCA ports (or use optional S-video for the video portion) and then connect the fireWire cable between the device and your computer

Optionally you can connect things in reverse and use the FireWire as the source with the converter changing your digital video into analog (I guess if you want to output your digital video to an older TV)

I have not used the device this way.My main use for the ADVC110 is to import lots of old VHS and 8mm tapes that I had recorded throughout the years into my computer

From there I am simply archiving the video files to external hard drives
This is great because now I can easily review tons of records straight from my computer with instant access instead of searching for tapes, rewinding them, etc

The video files are standard DV format and take up about 13GB of disk space per hour.So far I have imported about 100 hours of video with this device and it has worked flawlessly!There are two things that the ADVC110 did not come with that I had to purchase separately: An AC power adapter and a 4-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable


This may not apply to you if you are using a Mac computer or a desktop Windows computer, but for my Lenovo laptop they were required


Why? Since my laptop only has a 4-pin FireWire port I had to buy the 4-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable (Canopus includes other cables in the box, but not this particular one)


The problem is that 4-pin FireWire cables do not provide power to the device, so you then need to connect an AC power adapter to the ADVC110 in order for it to turn on


Once you have this setup and working everything is fine, but you should be aware that you need these two extra items if you will be using a 4-pin FireWire port

Also be advised that the AC adapter is quite expensive for what it is (search Amazon to see).All in all this is a fantastic device if you are serious about capturing high quality video from analog sources.

$REVIEW.: How could something so simple simply not work?? When I hooked up my Shuffle to my Mac Pro with this adapter a number of the USB ports SHUT DOWN after getting an error warning that the USB port couldn't handle the power needed to function with the attached adapter. I was forced to restart my computer and unhook USB cables to get the ports working again. I was able to only use this USB adapter with Apple's small USB charger, but I had to twist and manipulate this crappy adapter to get it to charge. Seriously flawed product. So, I spent the extra money and bought the Marware USB travel dock for the Shuffle and it WORKS using same USB ports on the front of my Mac Pro (no USB port shut-downs).Marware USB Travel Dock for iPod shuffle 2G (White)
$Helpful?.: [3, 3] $SUMMARY.: Avoid this cheap stuff. Shut down USB ports on my computer.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to use with my tablet for recording video with my tablet.  It is easy to use but even though the write up says that it fits most tablets and protectors (cases) it did not.  I was able to modify the holder by extending the adjustable slide side by using a small piece of metal and attaching the tablet holder to that piece.  It now works but it could be a bit more stable.The design is thoughtful but the execution not quite there.  All that said, it does work and if you don't use a tablet protector or case it likely could be used out of the box.  I'd suggest to the manufacturer to make the adjustable holder about 2 inches longer and this review could easily be four or five stars.

$review_text.: So glad I finally found this.  There should be many more options like this!!!!  Why was it so hard to find something like this?  This little guy is just what I was looking for!!!Objective:  While mountain biking, I wanted to leave my (android) phone playing through its internal speaker in my backpack, while still being able to pause, skip to next song, etc.  This little guy does the trick!!!My only beefs are that they didn't read my mind when designing it... it could be smaller and have a clip option (should be exactly same form factor as a Shuffle) and it should be waterproof, to protect from random sweat droplets flying...  ended up taping this thing to my bike's top bar using double-sided tape, would've been much nicer to clip it to my shoulder strap... and I'll probably have to rig some sort of saran-wrap "shower cap" to protect it from flying water...Or how about a true bicycle version with a handlebar mount and everything?  That would be AWESOME!!! Think of the possibilities, Satechi!!!!I do like the buttons, which are fairly "real" and tactile, not some pure virtual buttons...  they could use even better positive feedback i.e. a solid "click" but these are better than some...This guy paired with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus just fine, and work right out of the gate.  Using it with the PlayerPro app (paid version--awesome as well).  However on subsequent reconnects, it sometimes does not work until I go into the keyboard/input settings and do something, I don't know what... anything?  and then it starts working.  But once it is working, it is working solidly for that entire connection session.Kind of odd that this thing emulates an entire "keyboard", but I guess that's what it has to do.  And by the way, I was worried it'd be too big and bulky, but despite my desire for a smaller version, I cannot complain that this is "too big".Now can we please get some smaller, waterproof versions with built-in clips?  And maybe another version with a headset/earphones jack?  ok then thanks!

I was looking for a cheap replacement stereo for my brother in law as he was dissatisfied with his current stock setup but wasn't looking for anything fancy

I figured a bluetooth setup would be convenient for driving and talking so this would be a perfect setup for someone whose budget shopping for a stereo
When it arrived I had very mixed feelings about it, and I really had to let it set in for a few days before I decided to send it back all together...
and here's why.It looks a lot like a toy radio and I found it hard not to take it seriously
I felt like I would be insulting him by giving this to him
The next complaint, although it is a Bluetooth receiver that could be used for hands free it's mic is built into the unit itself
This causes a couple problems as you will receive a ton of background noise, it more than likely is a mufti-directional mic so have fun trying to be heard on a phone call, and I couldn't attempt to add a small windsock If i wanted to, which is a huge problem if you roll the windows down.Its not a horrible product, but its not something I would recommend buying if you take care of your car
I would think this would best fit in older vehicles for people who do not currently have a working radio and are buying it for themselves


Gifting this to someone could be taken as a joke.

$review_text.: I've been a long time Sony headphone customer for many years. It seems that one of the best kept secrets of the industry is the fact the Sony makes great sounding headphones and they don't charge a lot for it. These ear buds are cheap (I define cheap as under 20 bucks). I think they get overlooked as many people would look at them and think they have perhaps the same sub par sound as the included ear phones in many of today's electronics based on the price. They are are wrong.The advantage of in ear buds is that they are the original "noise cancelling" ear phones. Why? Because they plug your ear like ear plugs! This gives them a distinct advantage as most of the noise you hear is from the headphones.What makes these buds good?The tonal quality is good. Highs, mids, and lows are distinct and separate. The range is nice. The bass is strong. Sure you could get other buds that have stronger bass (even Sony has some that have stronger bass), but I felt this was enough to be quite present but not overpowering. I have a discerning ear. That being said I like my "lows" more then I like my "highs". I was not disappointed.The only con I can see is the quality of the wire might not be as good as others. Seems kind of thin even compared to my previous Sony ear buds. Overall it shouldn't be a problem as I don't really plan to wrap them tight or anything.Could you buy better ear buds? Sure. Bose, Sony, Klipsch and others offer them at premium prices. Could you buy better ear buds under 20 dollars? No way.
$review_summary.: Best 'bang for your buck' here. Great sound!

$REVIEW.: Setup of the DIR-628 was a breeze; it replaced an existing router, and I was able to get it up and running in about 10 minutes. The router looks fairly bland, but most people will have their router locked away in a cabinet anyway.The DIR-628 does not offer Gigabit network ports, which would have made it the perfect router in this price range. The user interface is very easy to navigate and there are no long reboots after you change each setting, like on other brands of routers.The wireless performance is impressive; I switched from a different brand router, and my wireless range has doubled with this device. I tested it using my Dell laptop with 802.11n, and the range/speed was perfect. In my house, I also have several 802.11g devices, but when they connect, the router speed drops to this slower network system and the 802.11n does not come to its full potential.Being able to switch to 802.11n on the 5GHz band is the perfect solution for anyone who lives in an area with a lot of other wireless devices, as the 5GHz band is barely used, but it is fairly useless if you are in an area with little to no other wireless. The 5GHz band is also not supported by all that many devices, in my case I had to leave it on 2.4GHz to support my Tivo and other wireless devices.All in all a great router, a great price, and something that would be worth 5 stars if it had Gigabit network ports.

Seems like a quality unit for a very reasonable price.As most have mentioned, it is a little difficult to plug something into the the outlets but as others have also mentioned its typically used for long periods of time.  Plenty of outlets for two computer and accessories.  I really like the 6 transformer spaced outlets, very useful.Overall, very good product, well designed.Thanks again Amazon!

I picked up three of these.  It took a little figuring out of how they did the VLANs (switch GUIs vary widely among models even with a mfg line) but this packs a lot of configuration options for a low price.  So far so good.  It even came with the most recent firmware, which is kind of unusual.  It's kind of cool you can power the switch off a PoE source, though I'm not using that.

Wiring was a breeze using a Scosche TA02B Toyota wire harness(SCOSCHE TA02B Wiring Harness for 1987 and up Toyota) - just connect the wires of both the Scosche harness and the JVC supplied harness according to colors. Also installed a Scosche TA2154B pocket kit (Scosche TA2154B Replacement Pocket Kit for 1978-Up Toyota) bought likewise from amazon to fill the open space below the radio. The radio and replacement pocket fit perfectly in my dash using the stock brackets.The radio unit sounds great and the stereo separation is very good. The HD FM is CD clear and the changeable color display is super cool. It took me some time though to get used to the wheel selector but after a few tries it was fairly easy to operate. No regrets with this purchase. Highly recommended for those wishing to upgrade to a simple single-din HU w/ HD radio,CD/MP3/USB/IpoD,iTunes tagging,Aux input and Front/Subwoofer pre-outs.

I've tried universal remotes in the past and they've always let me down by either not supporting one of my devices, or not supporting every button I need.The list of supported devices/brands is surprising, and you can customize buttons - change the behavior of buttons or add your own to the LCD screen.You can even make different buttons for different activities (when you're watching a DVD you have certain custom buttons, when watching TV, different ones)My only complaint about the product is the software used to set it up. You have to go through a "wizard" to do anything. In one or two instances, the wizard made me make changes that I didn't want to, in order to modify one particular setting. It's very easy to use, but if you're more advanced it can be frustrating.this dropped it from 5 stars to 4.

$REVIEW.: I bought these headphones to replace another pair that I've had for a few years.  I have to say that comfort wise my previous JVC's were more comfortable. It seems that the sony's have relatively small pads for the ears that sit on your ears as opposed to over the ears.soundwise, I would say that they are somewhat comprable.I do like that they come in red as opposed to all my black headphones.

$REVIEW.: This Bluetooth mouse is probably the best one on the market right now in this price range. I have been using this mouse with a Dell laptop running Windows 7 for a few weeks now. The tracking is accurate and responsive, and works on a wide range of surfaces. The buttons and scroll wheel click solidly without a problem. The blue Windows 8 button is a nice touch. Swiping up and down on it will cycle back/forth through whatever option you set it to, and pressing the button will open the Start menu. The mouse is also comfortable to hold, with rubber grooves on the side for your hand. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Bluetooth mouse.

$REVIEW.: I've had this watch for a few days and just completed my 4th run with it. I did notice a bit of a gps glitch on the first run I did, but this has not repeated itself to any serious degree since then. Even the first time was nothing that I'd say would seriously affect my training. Bottom line is, if you are going to be a cutting edge earlier adopter, expect that there are going to be some imperfections to iron out. If you need or expect perfection, you might want to give Garmin a chance to investigate the bug posted by the previous reviewer (assuming that he did not just have a faulty unit) and update the firmware.But I am completely satisfied with this watch and any minor errors I've seen are totally in line with what you would get from any other watch on the market. I've had a Garmin 305 for almost two years. That's generally held up as the gold standard of GPS watches. And that has given me the occasional GPS glitch that has been far worse than what I've seen so far on the 610.For a VERY full and comprehensive review on the watch, see:[...]He even comments on the previous reviewer's situation in comment 189, saying, "I agree there's an oddity (probably a little bug) there, but I disagree that it's an issue to worry about." I totally agree with this statement. There probably are some firmware issues, which I expect will get addressed, but I would not blow them out of proportion. Virtually every device, phone, computer, ebook reader, or software package ships with bugs. That's why they ship updates that fix things. Personally, I don't feel that any gps issue with this watch is in any way a show stopper.In summary, I love this watch. I would recommend it to anyone. One thing I would comment on is that I was doubtful that this watch could be worn as a regular watch, which other people have said it could be. But I have worn it full time since getting it and it looks great and is comfortable.

 I think a lot of people are hesitant to take the plunge, but with just a modicum of of a sense of adventure, you can start using this product, which as a DVR will simultaneously outperform every set-top box that your cable company wants to rent to you, while doing so for considerably less in monthly fees


 This thing is simultaneously cheaper AND better

 It's chalk-full of *win*
 All you need to start using it is a desktop PC with:1) An available PCIe x1 bus

 If you don't know what that is, simply google-image "PCIe x1"

 The prongs shown sticking out of the bottom of the Ceton InfiniTV 4 plug into this connection, which if you have one, can be found inside your PC

 If you don't have such a connection available, you should instead check out the "Ceton InfiniTV 4 USB", which is a similar-but-external device that will connect to your desktop via an available USB connection.2) Sufficient RAM


 Ceton recommends 4 Gigs


 If you'll want to have 3-4 users simultaneously (more on this later), you might want to be open to the idea of expanding to 8 gigs.3) Sufficient hard drive space to start laying down Recordings
 I'd recommend a 2-gig internal


 You can always offload recordings that you want to keep to an external hard-drive (as long as they aren't DRM-copy-protected, which often happens with HBO/Showtime/ect recordings).4) If you want to hook a TV up directly to your PC, having a video card capable of outputting HDMI is likely ideal.5) A Multi-channel CableCard (otherwise known as "M-Card") which you will rent from your local cable provider


 If you don't have any other equipment, many cable companies will give you the first card for free

 The rates on additional CableCards is often times somewhere between $2/month and $8/month, which is considerably less than renting a HDDVR set top box from your cable provider.Once you have all of those things covered, instillation and activation is pretty easy and very straight-forward.Once up-and-running, if your desktop is connected to your Network, then various other devices (like XBox 360's and the new Ceton Echo, for example) can access all of your PC's TV recordings and even take remote control over one of the 4 TV tuners


 So with some up-front equipment expenses (PC, Ceton InfiniTV, and perhaps a couple of Xbox 360's or Ceton Echo's), you can dramatically reduce your monthly cable bill, because each of these devices can be hooked up to a TV and, while connected to your network, provide your entire cable channel lineup and all television recordings to each of them (tuning to up-to-4-channels-at-once) while no longer paying your cable provider to rent any equipment


 So if you have 4 HDTVs in 4 rooms, and you're paying to rent 4 seperate boxes from the Cable Provider, those charges can all come off your bill, and all 4 TVs will be able to access the same TV recordings.For a long time, the only thing you didn't have access to over CableCard was OnDemand content

 You had to navigate to the Website using your PC, and you simply couldn't use it with Xbox
 Just recently, however, Comcast released an XFinity OnDemand App as a free download in the XBox Marketplace, so now all you have to do is leave the Windows Media Center interface and head back to your dashboard to get OnDemand content
 I'm not sure if this requires an XBox Live Gold membership (and it's associated </review_text><review_summary>Plug N Play</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="AASSDFY9K6G2T"><latest_review_date>01/09/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B000JLI4Q2</product_id><review_date>01/09/2013</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>As suggested by some of the previous reviewers, I located and downloaded a program called "h2testw" to run against the memory card.

Other than that, the card, adapter, and USB reader all seem to work fine.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's still a good value for me.  However, if I had bought this for a camera or something where I needed a true Class 10 card, I would've been really ticked off.

$REVIEW.: I was contemplating getting the 55", but I'm glad I went with the 50".  This thing is huge.  I love that you can control the brightness on the TV, and that it can automatically set the brightness based on the ambient light.  The base is pretty ugly, and I've seen more beautiful edges on other TVs.  The remote is quite ugly, and the backlighting on it is weak.  The user interface on the TV could use a lot of improvement.  Also, the position of the HDMI inputs is awkward on the side.  If you're mounting the TV, you will be able to see those cords pretty clearly.  Other than that, I have no complaints with the picture - everything that's 1080 is quite crisp.  If you don't have a receiver, the built-in audio is decent.Completely unrelated, and sadly prompted by a recent home break-in: always record the serial number of your TV and keep the box and manual.  It will help with warranty claims, theft, etc.

$review_text.: Just received..

camera works very well but audio is a bit cumbersome


 Currently, audio only seems to work via Internet Explorer and you have to turn it on each time by going to the "Visitor" menu

 Audio isn't an option in Firefox/Chrome
 Also, audio doesn't work for the iphone app (b/c the camera broadcasts WMA audio which Apple apparently prohibits).Anyway, I think I can get by w/o the Audio but it'd be a great feature for those looking to use this as a baby monitor


If they can figure out a better audio solution I'd give it 5 stars.

I wish this was like the previous generation I had that was 4gb and had a better battery
I also dont like that ipods only support itunes for updates

I hate itunes for being to resource intensive on my system and am forced to use mediamonkey just to transfer songs


Also I wish apple would actually make these things more durable and larger not smaller.

I use this to monitor people approaching my front door, which is about 35 feet away from the camera. I plan on changing the lens to a 12 mm lens, which is still enroute.The camera does a great job in daylight, and a passable job at night. I have it set to send me an email with photos and to upload the photos to my FTP site when there is an alert. It is very cool. I do get a few false alarms, I think it is from the light being switched on or off.Downside: the setup often requires a camera reboot after a change to the configuration.  So, &amp;#34;change a setting, wait a minute for a reboot, log back in, and repeat ten times.&amp;#34;  Also, the alert scheduler could be a little easier to work with... but this is an improvement over the previous Foscam cameras I have.But the picture is good and clear.Warning on setup, if you don't know what an IP DMZ is on a router, this is going to be a difficult setup. I'm just warning you on this. Get your techno-weenie network admin friend to come help you set this up. It will save you from entering a 1 star review.  If you can't assemble a IP network, you will spend  hours trying to figure this out. This was my third camera. It still took me nearly half an hour to set up, and I didn't have to reconfigure anything, I got it right the first time.Still, it works well for me and I would buy another one.

$REVIEW.: The design to strip the plastic and place the sticky side down to the iPad is backwards. I other words you cannot peal it and place it at the same time. Instead you have to strip it then place it. So unless your perfect at placing the screen and are in a clean room then you will end up with imperfections and particulate in between the iPad and the screen. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!

 I spent perhaps 1.5 hours on the phone with tech support, who ultimately could not get rid of it


 The first support person (in the Philippines) ended up "closing" the case (though the problem wasn't fixed) by telling me to scan for viruses
 Since the problem was related to a .dll and occurred only with the touchpad, I dutifully did the scan but expected no change

 No change is what I got.The second time I called tech support (someone else in the Philippines), he concluded that I was missing a Microsoft download, and I would have to work with Microsoft rather than Logitech to fix the problem


 Fat chance
 I did install the recommended download anyway, but it made no difference.So, it's going back

 Too bad, because I liked the design


 But this is a problem I can't circumvent or tolerate, and I'm tired of nonanswers from support
Plus, they say I have to work with Microsoft to fix it, so they wouldn't want to talk to me anyway.


$SUMMARY.: Never got rid of error message--called support twice

$review_text.: We have been using this for several months now and I have no complaints. For the cost and a brand name that I'm unfamiliar with it has been a good boom box so far.UPDATE: 1-30-2014 Well the tuning radio stations sucks. And the speakers just can't give you anything very loud. So, I'd have to say I wouldn't buy again. My earlier review was from me only using it once, my family was who was using it. I've used it many time now and don't like it.

But the sound immersion and quality just isn't the same, so I always keep my eyes open for headphones that might work for me.  I think that with these Polk headphones, I've finally found one!The headphones are pretty lightweight, considering their size and bulk.  The ears are very well-padded, and after fiddling around for a few minutes I was able to find a way to make them tight enough that they don't slide around as I walk through the house, but not so tight that they squeeze the ends of my glasses into my scalp.  I'm not confident that they'd stay in place if I was out jogging or something really active, but for hanging out at home and playing on the computer, they're fine.I'm not a sound snob, so I can't go into great technical detail about the quality of these headphones.  I think they sound great, fantastic, generally wonderful - but I'm just an average listener who usually uses ear buds.  But I'll be honest - if you're some sort of music professional who needs headphones for work, I honestly don't know whether these would meet your specifications.  Luckily, I'm sure there are other reviewers who can address more technical questions.I was really pleased by how well this worked for phone calls, too.  The quality was just as good as if I was holding the cellphone to my ear, and people that I talked to said they could hear me clearly.The three button control is really handy, since I'm usually listening to my iPod and if it's tucked away in my pocket, it's easier to quickly touch the button on the headset than to dig the electronic device out - especially when someone starts talking to me without waiting for me to take the headphones off first.I think the gold buckle design is a lot of fun.  If you are going to be wearing headphones anyway, why not wear something that stands out a little?  I'm so glad that I was given the chance to try a pair of these headphones out.

$REVIEW.: Having had many other small cameras in the past -- from tiny Minoxes to the latest Kyocera S3 -- I was really looking forward to having a small digital camera I could keep with me at all times.The Dimage X is a stunning little package; anyone who sees it wants to pick it up, hold it, and play with it.  The design and finish are first-rate. The size, though -- that's what this camera is all about.  It's the first digicam to use an internal zoom mechanism, which allows the X to be ridiculously slim.  Other cameras might have a slightly smaller &amp;quot;footprint&amp;quot; but the X wins where it counts -- it is so slim you forget it's in your pocket.  As a result it is very easy to keep with you at all times.The Dimage X works very well in daily use.  The most important convenience is its' speed.  Many other cameras simply take too long to turn on, or have very long wait times as they record an image.  The little Minolta is among the swiftest of cameras in these regards.  It also allows you to fire off several frames in rapid succession; it appears to allow around five pictures, then pauses to record them to memory.  This is very handy when your trying to capture something elusive -- children, for example.The X's lithium-ion batteries give what I consider very long run-times before expiring.  In comparison to another small digicam, the Kyocera S3, the Dimage X offers approximately double the battery life.  It gives ridiculously long run times with the LCD display switched off; the camera's internal electronics seem very well designed and appear to operate very efficiently.  The camera never feels hot to the touch (or even warm, for that matter); I noticed this was a problem with the Kyocera, which may account for it's short run-times.The only thing I dislike about the Dimage X is its' image quality.  To keep the zoom mechanism inside the camera required the use of a prism.  This limits the camera from being as sharp, ultimately, as a conventional camera, and also leads to slightly less contrast and color saturation in the images.To qualify this review I should admit to being a perfectionist who is reluctant to EVER compromise on image quality.  In this case the size and packaging of this camera have won me over.  With further refinement the Minolta Dimage X could approach perfection; as it stands it's one great little camera that will accompany you everywhere.

This is my 5th iPod and I had high hopes.  After a few days my reaction is mixed.Sound Quality-) My 60 GB iPod with Video had much better sound quality than this version.  I listened to both with my Bose QC-3 headphones, a pair of Bose earbuds and a pair of regular earbuds.  I had someone hold the iPods out of sight so I coudln't tell which I was listening to during my "blind" test.  The sound quality on the new iPod Classic is a bit muddy.  That's the best description I can come up with for the sound.  It wasn't so bad the new iPod should be returned but there was a difference that I couldn't describe as a good thing.I could hear less of a difference in quality between the two devices on the standard iPod headphones.  Since my other headphones are both mady by Bose, it is possible that there is some problem with the Classic and those headphones.  I listened to both in my car, which also has Bose speakers.  The sound was different but not as different as it seemed via the headphones.  Nevertheless, try it (with your headphones) before you buy it.  Sound quality is very subjective and you may prefer the classic.Interface+) Cover Flow is really a nice feature.  It makes me stop and listen to albums that I had forgotten about over the years as they get burried among all of the newer music.  I have had no problems with freezing.+) The ability to search is a wonderful improvement.  I am not one of those people that knows every artist name, album name, or song name.  It's nice to search on one word.  The more ways the iPod can allow you to find what you want to hear the happier I am.-) The click wheel on this version seems less sensitive.  While it may give you more control, it isn't as smooth and easy-to-use as previous iPods.+) The finish on this iPod (silver) doesn't show every finger print the way my 60 GB black video did.  You'll still see every print on the back, but at least the front of the device isn't a mess the moment you pick it up.Display+) The display on this iPod is better than every other iPod I've owned.  It's beautiful to look at and movies and music videos look great!!All in all, I'm happy with the new iPod.  However, if it wasn't a gift I would return it.  There aren't enough improvements versus drawbacks for me to part with my 5th generation iPod.  If you need something new because of a break or this is your first iPod, it's fine.  If you have a working device that you love, don't rush out to buy this.****Update March 2008****The latest software update for the iPod (not iTunes) has really improved the sound quality.  I don't notice the difference between the two models any longer and I'm very happy with the Classic at this point.

 I do have it all plugged in correctly (trust me - I'm more than qualified when it comes to electricity).Knowing what i know now, I wouldn't get one of these kind of power strips (had an APC brand do the same thing to me about a year ago) but would have got a plug strip with remote off switch so I could positively turn the whole mess off at night.On the good side, the plug layout is well thought out and works well for those clunky transformer plugs.2 stars because while it's a nice plug strip the power sensing auto-off does not work.

$review_text.: My first SLR camera and I was skeptical at first but after shooting my first 50-100 pictures I'm a canon lover for life.  There was an initial learning curve on the camera, dozens of features and settings were intimidating and took lots of practice to finally get the desired results.  Also purchased a 75/100mm lens to compliment the 18-55mm lens.  I shoot everything from my son's pee-wee football games, to my daughter's dance class, to family vacation photos.  The shots are simply amazing.  Great depth, clarity, color, focus, etc.  I'd like to claim credit for the pictures, but honestly the camera makes me look like a pro.  I'm glad I purchased this camera.  My wife has fell in love with the camera also.

Nice feature set, and competes against other awful sounding BT headphones that cost much more. May break sooner rather than later, and styling is utterly unappealing. Grade C-HK: The 1990 Buffalo Bills of headphones. Should have won the championship, but choked. Volume limit, creaky frame, and microphonic wired cable all suggest bad design. The volume issue may well be HK's tacit admission that their driver sounds good only at a certain maximal volume and breaks up after that. Other manufacturers seem to address the signal compression with added bass, and HK has avoided that solution, but the 75 dB wonders it produced instead are arguably a worse solution. Not worth the price now, but a good potential platform for further revision by HK. Grade: BCreative: Though a cheaper wired set of headphones like the ATH M50 will wipe the floors with these in terms of SQ, the noise cancelling feature, great isolation, and BT feature set make these a better commuter than the M50s. Strangely, these are at their best listening to quite piano music on the subway, where the bass bloat is less noticeable and the NC and isolation give the music center stage in a noisy environment. Could have / should have been better, but these are the BT headphones of choice for me, due to their commutability emphasized feature set. Grade: B+</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="ACH47QY2HCFQ2"><latest_review_date>10/11/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B007RESFR2</product_id><review_date>10/11/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Western Digital 'My Passport' is a must have</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="ACHTDPEQYSEQL"><latest_review_date>13/01/2009</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B004IEALCQ</product_id><review_date>13/01/2009</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>I bought this because I used one with a rental car.

$REVIEW.: I used this mainly as a source to watch portable videos, music, and as an alarm clock and calender and such
 The amount of applications that you can put on is vast and a lot of them are free which are cool
 I would think 8gb was enough for me because I had about 3 full movies and about 20 mp3 albums on mine and it still didn't touch the storage space
 If your looking for a PDA, music, video, calender and such, look no further


 I would suggest getting the 2nd generation iTouch they have now because it has an external speaker as well as headphones
The first gen you can only use headphones to listen to sound
 The 2nd generation is also smaller and a little better software updated I believe


 I am just reviewing this one because this is the one I bought when I had it

 The touch screen is amazing and this is the device that made me fall in love with Apple


 Their macbooks are nice, but the performance is not up to par on how much they cost


 I would definately buy Apple Accessories like this again though, I was thinking about getting the 2nd gen because I sold my first gen

 Maybe when they come down in price a little


 Anyways, if you want a great mp3 player, look no further this is the best product you will find, it's simply amazing.

I always change to the smaller size and for me the fit is better and the low end (bass) is better. They do a good job at removing external sounds/noise. Not quite as good as earplugs but close. (I also wear earplugs regularly). The cord is long enough without being too long. The longest I've worn them is three hours and they were comfortable the entire time.

I would definitely recommend this to people in a similar situation.  Once you get the device you will need to hook it to your computer to connect it to your wireless network; then it's just plug'n'play from there.UPDATE: Stopped working :( It was such a cool product, maybe it's getting refurbished that killed it..my experience with refurbished routers on amazon was poor aswell.  My recommendation for wireless products is to buy new.  This thing just all of a sudden stopped working; I tried a hard reset and tried to reconnect to my home wireless signal and while it attempts to connect and says it takes 2 minutes it will drop the connection attempt completely.  I went to update the firmware but I can't even pull up it's settings screen that manual says is [...] .

I did a lot of shopping around and comparison before I plunked down my hard earned coin.  I tried various models and makes at three different optical shops and borrowed, borrowed and borrowed some more from friends and family (Birders all).  Of all the binoculars I tried and tested these were by far the best for the money.  I was trying to hold the cost down to below six hundred dollars and strongly feel I bought binoculars here that are way more worth what I paid for them.The clarity on these things in absolutely amazing.  This review is in reference to the 8.5x45 ones.  I had been using 10x... in the past but to be honest when it comes to the identification of birds in woodlands and meadows, it would be hard to beat these things.  Now don't take me wrong.  If you are doing water or sea birds and having to spot out at great distances, then you do need more power...I use a spotter scope for that.One of the best features on these bins is that I am able to start birding earlier and stay later because these thing really draw in the light and are great for use in shaded areas.  Also, I have smaller hands and these fit perfectly.  The focus wheel is smooth with absolutely NO play what so ever.  They are relatively light yet have a very strong "feel" to them.  I have used these in very wet conditions and they are indeed waterproof.  I like the way the lens caps are attached.  These are very comfortable binoculars to use and carry.There are indeed better binoculars out there but as far as I can tell and have found, for the price these would be very near impossible to beat.

$review_text.: It's a very good looking and sturdy shelf and it's much larger than it looks in the picture. It does seem to take a lot more work than I was expecting to mount. However, you can also configure it in numerous ways, so it makes up for it.FYI - I was able to mount it above the TV with the wires going down through the channel, despite all of the picutres and instructions only showing it below a TV.After getting the first one for the living room, I ordered another for the bedroom. I suppose I found it to be such a pain because I had to mount them 10 feet in the air while standing on a ladder. The overly complex mounting procedure is really bad for trying to do that.

I use it EVERY DAY!I am waiting for the price to drop a little before I buy another one. The only reason I am getting a new one is because it doesn't seem like the headset is as tight on my head anymore. But the sounds and functionality of it is still perfect. I have never had any issues that others have mentioned (the mute letting some sound through, people not being able to hear me, etc.)So I would have to say this item deserves a 5 star rating. I wouldn't be buying it again if it didn't! And I love the fact that the microphone comes down to your mouth, but it doesn't have a "spongy thing" on it. Maybe it is all in my head, but the sponge thing seems very unsanitary to me. I can clean this one with a swipe of  disinfectant cloth. Can't do that to the spongy thing!

Even though the surround sound is digital simulation it is sure good enough for a non expert like me. It also surprised me how quickly the headphones recharged. I have some hearing loss and found that these headphones actually help with clarity of high frequency sounds.  All in all I was very pleased with my RS170 and would highly advise giving them a try. The quality is every bit of what I had expected and more.

The average person who does not have a lot of time to spend learning to use a new camera will be very pleased with this. First of all its so lightweight and small- I can fit it into the smallest compartment of a bookbag. But it also gives you easy menu options by using a touch screen- you simply touch and click the settings on the camera using the interface and you are able to scroll right  on the LCD screen. Its really like having a digital camera you use for pictures only it does video as well.You can choose to store your videos either on your SD card, or on the hard drive of the camera. But I do recommend using the SD card for your settings. You can adjust the lighting and quality of your picture. I was skeptical about the sound quality of the camera because it is a completely digital model- however the sound is very crisp and clear and using it outside, I did not even have trouble from the wind.The only downside to the camera is that it does not do as well in very dark rooms, or if you're filming something on stage with only stage lights. The clarity is not quite as good. However, it can get some decent night shots of outside if there is enough lighting. I use this camera as a musician to film music videos, record gigs, and film short music videos. It really is so easy to use and its just a nice little camera that gets the job done for a person that likes to upload videos to sites such as youtube, etc. This is ideal for someone who wants quality picture,  but simplicity in use.

 When I'm using the various tools, I always attach a vacuum hose to control the dust and shavings, if the tool is set up for it
 The problem is that the shop vac and the tools are often some distance apart and it's tempting not to bother with the vac if I'm only making a few cuts or sanding a small area
 There are devices such as theiVac Automated Vacuum Switchthat will control a shop vac automatically when a tool is activated

 The downside of this solution is that it's expensive and only works for 110v tools


 I have a mix of 110v and 220v machinery, so this won't work for me.So far the Etekcity is working just as I expected


 Either of the 2 remotes will reliably start and stop the shop vac from anywhere in the shop


 I'm happy that 2 remotes come with this because I can leave one at each end of the shop and I'm never far from one.This thing is big

 I have it plugged into aTripp Lite PS2408 Power Strip 120V 5-15R 8 Outlet 15ft Cord Vertical Metal, and unfortunately there is no way to avoid having it cover 2 of the outlets

 Fortunately, that still leaves me 6 more, which is enough


 I dinged it one star due to the size.


$review_summary.: Works well for remote operation of a shop vac dust collector, but it's pretty big.

As it comes, the Nexus 7 is a bit too bright for reading at night but there is an app to custom dim the screen further to make it just right for your eyes.- replace a laptop computer. With a touch-screen, such simple matters as selecting text to cut copy or paste can be &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; utterly maddening.&gt;&gt;&gt; However, these routine tasks become easy, even quite pleasant, with a decent external mouse and good external keyboard. Good peripherals take up very little briefcase space and really make the Nexus 7 an excellent road-warrior. An OTG cable and app change the charging micro-USB port into an external access port for reading and writing memory sticks and even powered hard disk drives. 16GB is plenty with such external storage. When not working, the Nexus 7 tablet is such a handy package you are most likely to have it, well, right at hand.- The screen is remarkable for watching movies and is very nice for video calls (Skype, Tango, etc.) I am pleased the screen is also very readable for texts, emails and browsing the Internet. (My eyes really are those of a senior although my younger-than-my-age brain is shocked to see how old I am in the mirror... :)All of this for about $50 more than only an e-reader! Do look up the LONG Nexus 7 review here on Amazon which has a Very Large Number of comments -- because that author gives superb technical advice.As a Windows computer guru and Mac aficionado, I did not expect to be so impressed with the Nexus 7, but I am. When I ordered this Nexus 7 I was already aware that an improved version would be coming soon. I bought this one anyway because the value-to-price ratio is so positive. I came to depend on my first Nexus 7 so much, that for the price I wanted a spare machine I could configure identically. (Two Nexus 7 cost me less than a laptop. Spend $200 for a spare tire, professionally speaking? Sure.) This time I sprang for the 32 GB model (my other Nexus 7 is fine with 16GB) because when travelling I can sometimes be uncluttered of peripherals to use the additional storage for movies, downloaded programs and music.Do get a good case for it. (The Nexus 7's lovely screen is not the latest Gorilla glass.) For its fine protection and versatility, I very much like the Moko Slim Fit case which I've reviewed for the Nexus 7.Android is something else but definitely worth learning to use, so be patient getting through the learning curve.The Nexus 7 is most highly recommended.

I used it fairly heavily the first week then it died, wouldn't pair or light up. I tested it on another ipod dock with the same results. I tried a few times again over the next couple of days with the same results, I figured it was dead.A month later i come across it in my junk drawer and decide to give it another shot, surprisingly it worked! it has been working ever since but i am treating it like its a newborn baby. I would suggest you remove it when not in use, as some devices continue to feed power to it and I suspect can burn it out or shorten its lifespan.In addition, every time I use it, I must go into my phones Bluetooth settings and manually pair the device. I have had the same results with the Galaxy S3, and Galaxy Note 2. It may be a phone issue, but i doubt it as I have plenty of other devices that will automatically pair when turned on and in range.If it had worked perfectly I would have given it a higher rating, but due to my experience, 3 stars is all i can honestly give.

$REVIEW.: I figured out why my old microSD card died on me.  When I plugged in my old Android phone at work, the antivirus software of my laptop wanted to scan the whole thing every time.  I was plugging it in to charge it, but the constant reads wore out the flash.  My new Android phone mounts as a CD drive (instead of the entire thing). I can only see the phone if I unmount my CD drive.  This is perfect for charging at work now.  Be careful with virus scanners if you have an Android phone that auto mounts your entire phone's Micro SD!

$review_text.: I now own five of these.  Bought the first one about two years ago.  Each time I am in the market for another mouse (adding laptops and even desktop systems to the family) I read the reviews, ask users of other mice (I work in the industry so there are always a lot of folks around with mice), touch and feel, and compare.  I keep coming back to this one for a variety of reasons.1)  For a laptop mouse, it's a good size (would prefer even larger).2)  Very long battery life, especially compared to bluetooth mice.3)  Standard batteries (2xAA).4)  Accuracy and responsiveness.5)  Brand trust.6)  Only has the button/controls I use so nothing gets accidently clicked.7)  Quality build.The above are not necessarilly in order of importance.  I would buy another (if I needed a mouse).  I even use them on desktop systems.

$REVIEW.: I just hooked up a Netgear 3500L V.2 Gigabite router, about 2 weeks ago. My main PC was only running at 100Mpb, yellow light on router indicates that. Took 1 minute to install, and Win 7 auto detected new device, auto loaded driver, green light now on router or 1000Mpb. After reading the reviews, I decied not to go with a cheaper product, and I am very happy with this product. Skip the cheaper one's, save a headack, cause thier like rolling dice. The entire set up install, reboot, auto detect was about 3 minutes. If you have a gigabite router, you need a gigabite card. My on board Intel 10/100, did not interfere with this install. Was a breeze. Bob...UPDATE 10/22..Inrel onboard was still set to run. Did not interfere with gigabite card, but I went into bios and turned it off, rebooted, everything fine.

$REVIEW.: This 8.9" Tab is basically the 10.1", only a little smaller with all of its good and some not so good features. I am not going to go into 'specs' because they are available at Amazon and at Samsung's own site (yes, there's Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi and so forth) but I will discuss my week-long experience of using it.I am not sure if 8.9" is the sweet spot in tablets but it's good that, unlike a certain rival, Samsung is moving away form the 'one size must fit all' philosophy. I am personally okay with 10.1" but the slightly smaller size may appeal to those who do a lot of on-screen thumb-typing. Also, since the resolution is the same 1280x800 you get a higher pixel density that improves on the 10.1" impressive display.POSITIVES- Lighter - Smaller means a couple of ounces lighter. A possible advantage if you're using the Tab as a reader.- Super-responsive to touch, possibly even more so than the 10.1" Tab.- Flash 10.2 is not only supported but it comes pre-installed - one thing not to worry about.- Samsung adds its own mini apps tray. In the end you pick your favorites from the market but some choice is always a positive.- Size, of course. Anyone who gets the 8.9" picks it for its size so, again, choice.- Great forward and rear facing cameras, same as the 10.1"- Dual-core processor handles Honeycomb with ease and, hopefully, makes it a good candidate for a future ICS upgrade.- You can have the Android market and the Amazon Appstore installed.NEGATIVES- Memory can't be expanded due to lack of a microSD port (but 32GB should be sufficient)- No HDMI port either- Backside could be a little thickerRATINGI had the opportunity to use the 8.9" Tab for one week, swapping our recently-upgraded ICS (Android 4) XOOM, mainly because a friend was eager to experience the 'new' Android. In the end, we were both favorably impressed with the other's tablet and agreed that we could live happily with either.While I understand that the some could miss an HDMI and an SD slot the reality is that my XOOM has them and the only time I actually used them was while testing my tablet. I did not miss them on the Tab during the week I had it for myself. I prefer the 10.1" format myself but I must admit that the crisper display was quite attractive.In the end, the 'negatives' are not such a big deal. I can say that I loved playing with the smaller Tab for a few days.

It is silly to start comparing this lens to others that cost 6 to 10 times as much money.I am using this lens on a Nikon D7000.  I have read other reviews about the slow focus speed but I am not seeing that on my camera body.  It focuses fast and adjusts rapidly using the continous mode.  Focus speeds have as much to do with the camera body you are using as it does the lens itself.  This lens does not have the internal focus motor so it will not work on cameras that do not support this such as the D5000.The pictures I have got are very sharp up to about 400mm.  The image quality suffers a little from there to 500mm.  It is something I can live with and the images are still usable but get a little soft.  Up to 400mm this lens is very sharp.  For wildlife this lens works great and you can get shots you would have otherwise missed because of the reach.It is a fairly slow lens but I have found that it does not get into the 6.3 range until you pass the 400mm mark.  I bump my ISO to 800 or so and have no problem getting crisp images handheld.  I normally shoot on a monopod because I am shooting wildlife and mostly in the wait and shoot mode and this lens gets heavy.With the hood on and zoomed to 500mm this lens is long, very long.  With the hood off and the zoom returned it is a short lens.  One of the things I do not care for is how many rotations of the zoom ring you have to turn to go from 200-500.  The Sigma is much quicker.This lens does not have Image Stabilization which would have been nice but would probably add another couple hundred dollars and weight to it.  It does come in a very nice padded case and features a filter ring that can be adjusted with the hood on.  Filters are 86mm which are very costly.  Tripod mount is very solid and located well for easy access.Conclusion:  This is a great lens for the money.  It focuses fast and produces crisp pictures.  It is a slow aperature range but I have not had any issues in daylight with focus or speed.  I didn't want to spend 3 to 5 grand on a lens that I will not be using that much.  IMO, this is a specialized lens that I use for wildlife.  I might use it 20-25% of the time.  I normally shoot a 80-200 Nikon 2.8 for my sports and action photography.  This lens would not be very good for that task.

As a result, many times I had the sad experience of finishing the day trip with some great shots missed.  I finally decided to place an overflow disk in my camera since there was a slot for one.  I have taken pictures all day and into the night now that I have this SanDisk and have yet to run out of room.  I'm delighted with it, the price I got it for, and the speed of delivery.

Yes, I can put a Surface in a backpack, but this is much easier to take around the house or with me on errands.  I ended up buying a case with a bluetooth keyboard so when I want to do serious work (e.g. long email for my job) I can be more productive..And that's where it really shines for me.  Yes, I can read books, play media, and browse the internet, but what I'm loving is that I can get my corporate email on it and work on Office docs seamlessly while on the road, something I can't do with my wife's iPad.Skydrive mounts as just another folder in explorer, so dragging &amp; dropping files back and forth from the cloud to the device is seamless and natural.  I use this a lot because not everywhere has good wi-fi, or wi-fit at all.  Or even cell reception (so tethering doesn't get me anything).There are more and more apps for the Win platform now so aside from a game or two I haven't found anything I need that hasn't been available for the platform.My wife has been an iPad addict since the v1, and I'm seeing her use my Venue more and more as the weeks go on, for the same reasons I cited above (productivity).Just like the Nokia 920 with Win8 was the first WinPhone that was worth moving away from the iPhone for, this is the first 8" Win tablet that I think is worth the money, esp. as it really is more than an entertainment device, which is all most tablets are good for.My next task is hooking it up to a full 23" monitor and keyboard/mouse (just need to order and adapter), and then I can get rid of my laptop too.

$REVIEW.: Use it as a sata dock or as a standalone duplicator. It takes about 90 minutes to duplicate a drive and works fine with either 2.5" or 3.5" drives. What more can I say?My only complaint is that it copies from drive 2 to drive 1 and you'll need a magnifying glass to read the labels that tell you this. Also, when you push the button to change to standalone operation, you have to hold it down for a few seconds.No regrets though.

$REVIEW.: **Looks like the price on this has gone from $29.99, which is what I paid, to $39.99**I got a pretty good deal on this bundle. I own the Kindle Touch wifi and all the items here fit it well. This is great for having an extra wall charger, car charger, headphones, reading light, as well as a few other nice to haves. I primarily bought this for the screen protector and a protective folding case. The screen protector was a disappointment. It states it's anti glare (a sticker on the packaging also claims it's for the kindle touch). Be forewarned, it's not any less anti glare than other screen protectors that do not make this claim. It fits the screen wonderfully, so you will need to be extra careful not to scratch the screen when you remove it (since you probably will go ahead and try it anyway and realize the protective screen really detracts from your reading experience ;)).Everything else on here is as described. The folding case has pockets for id's and credit cards/business cards. These sit right over the kindle screen and may put pressure on it if you decide to use them much.The quality of the items isn't of the highest caliber, but it's OK for what it is. Some of these items look and feel like they came from the dollar store right down to the packaging. For the record, I charged my Kindle using this charger and neither item burst into flames. The wall charger has a bright green light on it. It could almost double as a nightlight, so you may not want to leave it on all night long in a bedroom if a little light bothers you. I tried the headphones and didn't go deaf and they sound better than the ones you get on an airplane. The stylus pen also works with my cell and tablet.

(My other computer is a 15" MacBook Pro.) The extra bit of screen size on this 11.6" Acer makes a huge difference compared to the D250, and the quality of the display is excellent. Obviously the processer is an upgrade over the Atom in the D250, as is Windows 7 over XP. The addition of the HDMI port (without deleting the still-necessary VGA port) is very helpful as well, and the new design of the power cord (small brick on the plug itself, with a reconfigurable head and built-in velcro strap) is a significant improvement over its already svelte two-piece predecessor. Battery life is excellent. I frequently stream live video and have no problems. It is the ideal size and weight for travel and seems durable; I almost always take this on trips instead of the Mac. Admittedly it is not as flashy as a tablet, but it is much more functional for those who still want/need a physical keyboard and traditional computing capabilities in a very small package and don't want/need to pay three times more for an ultrabook.I have had the computer for five months, and I give it five stars. I would absolutely purchase it again with no regrets, especially for the price I paid (under $300). I hope, though, that Acer will address a few issues for future models. The speakers are shamefully poor. Though Acer hails the keyboard as full-size, this comes with a price: the keys are very close together (with maybe half the space between keys compared to a Mac) and very flat. (I found the smaller keyboard on the D250 preferable.) It takes a very long time for the machine to wake up after hibernation; perhaps that is a software problem? I don't care for the "water ripple" design on the lid (but really like the bottom, if not for those stickers . . .). Despite these issues, I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Let me get this straight first off: I love these. The best headphones I've owned in a long time. Can't beat the price, either.Now, I will say that the levels are pretty low. As others have said, you've got to have your computer's volume up a bit more than some other headphones. Definitely not a huge problem, but it makes switching from headphones to speakers fun. Also they don't isolate noise as well. Not a deal breaker for me, but it may be for some.What I love about these: Long cable (Maybe 10 feet), great sound quality, and they're very comfortable.

The response from OREI was troubling to me
 The issue is that this adapter allows a two-pronged, polarized plug to be plugged into the adapter with the neutral side of the plug connected to either the line voltage or neutral side of the mains voltage
 In other words, the adapter is not polarity sensitive
 Plugging a 3-pronged plug into this adapter connects the neutral side of the plug to the terminal on the adapter marked "L" which one would reasonably believe to be the line or voltage side of the plug
 Either the adapter is marked incorrectly or this is the reverse of what it should be and apparently puts line voltage on the neutral side of any 3-pronged appliance.My wife just came back from Ireland and used this adapter to charge her camera battery
Since her camera battery charger is not polarity sensitive there was no safety concern
 However, she did not use her hair dryer which has a 2-pronged polarized plug because of safety concerns


 OREI glossed over my question with a generic response

They need to redesign this product and make it polarity sensitive (allow polarized plugs to be plugged in only one way, the proper way) and confirm that their markings are correct on the adapter..

I still use my FZ50 professionally, upgraded from an FZ20 to a 35 to the 50.  Wanting a point-and-shoot, but something more than snaps, for my personal life, I went to the Lumix.  The ZS series has been excellent.  For personal work, I don't want to spend a lot of time setting up shots, and I'm more likely to want quick reaction to capture a fleeting moment or motion.  No point-and-shoot (p&amp;s) will be excellent at that, but that doesn't mean I can't get one that does well in a majority of situations.  My Lumix ZS3 performed exceptionally well for a p&amp;s, and the ZS7 did even better.  So looking over the specs of the ZS10, I decided to buy one.  While I rarely use the video feature (I was raised on still photography!), much improved in this model, I wanted quality for stills.  16X zoom (to 21 with some kind of electronic extender option) up from 12X, and 14.1 megapixels up from 12.1.  Improved antishake (at my age it's very useful), and GPS (which eats battery, can be turned off, but is occasionally useful for verifying sources), and other software I will continue to try out.  So far so good, with crisp photos in most situations.  Still is only good, not great, in low light; is better at eliminating motion blur (CMOS instead of CCD), and the easy menu help make this a worthy upgrade.  Flash is still basic minimal (about 8 feet), typical of a p&amp;s.  Uses the same battery as the ZS3, so didn't have to buy new ones.  Mini-USB plug (at camera) to standard USB plug is also typical.  I invested in SanDisk Ultra cards (Class 6), and they work well.  My 8 Gb says it will take 2800 pictures at 12.1 Mp.  I don't think I'll ever reach that number, preferring to upload to my computer regularly, but it's nice to have spare capacity.  The ZS10 has an SDXC host software, so can take the new BIG cards (48 and 64 Gb), but their high cost makes them uneconomical currently for me.  Still, nice to have the capability (NOTE: lots of cautions say NOT to put an SDXC card in an SD/SDHC camera that DOES NOT have an SDXC host software).  So instead bought a moderately expensive Extreme Pro SDHC (Class 10) 32 Gb card, and in this camera the irritating lag between pictures (typical in nearly all electronic cameras) was shortened noticeably.  That's nice!  The ZS10 will run SD, SDHC, and SDXC, so my legacy cards are still fine.  From a first day testing perspective, the ZS10 has shown its mettle, an improvement (significant, if not huge) over the ZS3, and in most situations where a personal camera is useful, takes excellent pictures, and has a reasonably useable menu.  I like my blue one.

$review_text.: I will be very honest, I have absolutely tossed out cordless phones to go to Costco and buy a new 5 pack or whatever they have these days


 The reason?  because they were no longer holding a charge!  Dumb I know

 But, this time I thought why not just try some batteries?  So, off to Amazon I went and found these


 Ordered 4 of them to go in my 4-pack of Uniden phones I got at Costco as described above


 Charged them over night and guess what?  THEY HOLD A CHARGE AGAIN!  Serious, that easy


 I can now leave the phones off the cradle for days and still have the indicator showing 100%  Hands down, excellent purchase.



$review_summary.: My phones are like new!  Why don't more people just replace the batteries???

This just defeats the purpose of a stand if you have a protective case around your iPad.  It is not flexible or adjustable.  I would not buy this unless you just have an iPad and no case.  I think there are other stands out there though that would be better for you.  Just my honest opinion.

$review_text.: Excellent performance, however, it is not at all on par with my true solid state drives in my MacBook laptops


 I am currently using this hybrid drive as a second storage drive for my iMac

 It's still an excellent drive for the price with oustanding performance-- just not in the same league as a true solid state drive

 Over time, it will [supposively] adapt to your computing habits by storing the most frequently accessed data in the small solid state component


 For most casual users, I can see this being a viable and economical alternative to a full-fledged solid state drive

 But, if you are a power user, as you already know, boot speeds probably won't be impacted dramatically
 I still rate the drive a solid &amp;#34;B+&amp;#34; - it has been running strong for months with heavy usage


 I am very impressed with Seagate's products overall.

After changing several clips to DV format (with QuickTime) I imported them into iMovie on my Mac, merged them together, and presto, I have a great show that includes both stills and movies. I also appreciate the fact that Canon includes separate instruction booklets in English and Spanish.  This sure beats having one oversized book, half of which would be of no use to me.

They do not last as long as the previous battery but you cannot blame the battery, blame the maker. So now that you have decided to buy one extra, make it two. Trust me.

Candlelight mode leaves the pictures a bit too yellow


Stage mode works great

Only real problem with the camera is it is a power hog; On our third battery in just 6 weeks, and we only took around 200 pictures or so during that time period


At this rate, we have decided to get the rechargable battery, which will pay for itself in short order.

$REVIEW.: In my system I needed two music bridges to reach two audio systems, and one of the bridges needed to work through a Range Extender. The instructions were ok for getting the simple one going. I had real difficulty getting the Range Extender to work with the music bridge, though. I finally found that you have to give the second Music Bridge a different name and then initialize the range extender after the Music Bridge is located and plugged in.In the end, I can't use both bridges at the same time from the same computer, so I use one from one computer and one from another.I am an electronics engineer, and it took me several days to figure it all out. I expect most people would have given up on such an installation.Jim

$REVIEW.: I use this all the time. It comes with the wall charger that has 2 USB outlets, 1 cable with 2 power tips - one that fits most cell phones and another that fits most mp3 players and GPS units. It would have been better to have 2 separate cables as it is easy to lose the small tips. Another drawback is that when you plug this in, it hogs the both wall outlets. If you put it in the top outlet, it covers the bottom outlet. If you put it in the bottom and plug your USB cords in then the USB cords block the top outlet. So this would not be a good choice if you are low on outlets.I usually don't use the included cable anyway and I have plenty of outlets. I like to have a single charger that allows me to charge 2 devices at once. I have several devices that came with USB cables so I could charge from my PC, but it would have cost extra for a wall charger too. Now I don't need to worry about it anymore.

$REVIEW.: First off, these earphones are great! I've owned about 3 or 4 pairs of them. They are comfortable, stylish, versatile, and usually last me about 8-10 months. I take them with me everywhere because I never know when I will need some headphones. The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is because of one annoying aspect. When I use them while walking outside, the cord tends to stiffen, as if it freezes, when it is exposed to any temperature below 20 degrees. This can be somewhat annoying because the cord will bulge out in front of me or to the side and stay in that position until I get inside. Of course, I usually just tighten the cord a little bit while holding on to it in my pocket and that works most of the time. Again, great earphones!

I listened with the same flash drive loaded with the same audio files I was using before having it replaced. It is connected to the same amps and is playing back through the same speakers.Right out of the box, the Alpine's highs are comparatively muted and rolled off. I don't hear the natural sound of cymbal decay for example as I did with the Pioneer. The mids and low end are excellent but with a muted high end, the overall presentation is a little disappointing. I spent some time in the advanced eq section but so far haven't been able to find a natural sounding high end. I'll have to spend more time with the advanced eq options. Maybe I'll find the sweet spot. If I do, I'll update this review.On the upside, the controls are excellent and intuitive. I couldn't be happier with how well thought out and easily accessed they are. There's also a bookmarking feature which makes this an ideal system for listening to audio books, podcasts and other spoken word files. But that's not enough. Audio quality is my top priority and on that count, this unit is somewhat of a disappointment - so far. I did not buy this from Amazon (wish I had for the return policy but wanted an experienced installer to take care of it). If you're looking for the last word in d/a conversion, this may not be it.Update: traded for a Pioneer DEH-80PRS after ~3 weeks of ownership. As good as this unit is in most areas, the sound quality was just shy of great.

$review_text.: At the time of this review the pricing for the 64GB model I own is about two  bucks per gig. This time next year it will probably be a fraction of that, and therein is the value of this drive to me.I own a pair of them and use them for rotating back-up. My laptop's 80GB drive is nowhere near full, so this is where I do my daily back-ups. It's not cheaper than CD media, but it's a lot more convenient than swapping discs and definitely quicker. I plug it in at the end of the day and launch a copy script I wrote and - voila! - the machine is backed up. I just overwrite existing files instead of doing an incremental. It's brute force, but also effective. The next day I rotate in the other drive I own, so I always have a back-up that is never more than two days old in case something should happen to one of these.This also works with my Android phones in conjunction with aMicro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0 Adapter. I move the internal memory of my phones to this drive on a weekly basis.Granted, at some point cloud storage will drop to the point where it's more economically feasible than flash drives, but at present physical drive capacity is far cheaper and this is the solution I am going with. It has served me well and this drive has paid for itself a few times when I did need to recreate an entire My Documents directory when my laptop crashed.

$REVIEW.: This product, in every way except being white, is identical to the New Trent IMP50D but is much less expensive (I have both). It powers/charges a 1G iPad nicely and any other USB device I've tried it with. Be warned, with both this and the New Trent version, it won't supply TWO power hungry devices at once. It's real output is 1 amp combined between the two jacks not the 1 amp plus 0.5 amp (1.5 A) claimed. So an iPad alone (or some of the more power hungry phones) will max it out by themselves. But that's not a big drawback. It's great to bring on flights, throw in your backpack, etc. for lots of reserve power.And, as an aside, this is about the cheapest device of this kind I'm comfortable with. Just Google "lipo fire" and you'll find out what cheaply made Lithium Poly batteries, as are in all of these devices, can do when things go wrong. They catch fire, explode, shoot flames at 1000+ degrees, and more. Houses and cars have burned to the ground, flights have made emergency landings, etc. So buyer beware. It's best to buy from a company with an established brand name and some assets in the USA. New Trent seems to be such a company, and this seems to be an "OEM" version of the product they sell.

$REVIEW.: I have tried every kind of mouse to relieve the strain on the fingers, wrist and even my right arm

I currently have a Logitech track ball mouse and a Logitech keyboard on my main PC at home
But my arm is bothering me so I looked for and found this touch pad


For me, it is awesome

I love it

I would buy another one for my work laptop but that laptop is still using Windows XP and the touchpad does not support XP


Darn! I would and will recommend this to anyone.I find the two finger scrolling to work very well
I have not had much need for the three-finger paging yet

I tested it when I first installed the device and it worked just fine.Enjoy.

 I settled on the w1070, but then I started comparing other projectors near this price range


 The reason I choose the Benq w1070 is that I can get a 100&amp;#34; image at only 8'9&amp;#34; back


 Secondly, lens shifting, and third, incredible online reviews

 I have researched way too much about projectors because I knew every complaint anyone has ever written about the W1070

 When I fired it up, I was stunned how good the picture looked


 I have a 55&amp;#34; Panasonic Plasma and it looks like a 100&amp;#34; plasma


 No rainbows, no noise, very even picture across the screen
 Colors were incredibly vibrant and images were sharp and very little fan noise


 I tweaked a few settings with the Wow video and the picture looked even better

 I am using an Elite 100H screen and the combination is awesome

 I haven't tried 3d yet, but I can't wait to check it out.

I plugged it into my nearly-dead iPod and it recharged the device and gave me additional play time.It has a series of suction cups intended to make it stick to the back of an iPod.  Assuming you don't carry yours in any sort of case, the battery is meant to be unobtrusive and convenient to use.  I did see a problem with this feature...the suction cups are made of a rubber that is a dust magnet, and once they get dusty they don't stick any more.  They are not easy to clean, either.I'd say that this is a good battery if you are satisfied with it's single purpose.  If, like me, you carry a lot of USB-chargeable devices, you might want a battery that has a standard USB port and is much more flexible.

In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive

I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help
Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760
I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work
The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it

The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal

I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints
I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great
This one must have been defective.

$REVIEW.: I bought this recently to replace an older 5 disc Sony model that I spent nearly 200 for just 2 years ago


Some changes I noticed include: they did remove the front panel menu navigation buttons, so make sure you don't break/lose your remote

Also gone is the cool 2 color front panel lights around disc buttons 1-5


One good thing though is that they made it shorter in height, thin is in

Never had a problem w/ my old one, Sony is among the leaders in reliability


I like the dot matrix display a lot- which features a 3 stage dimmer.This model DVP-NC875V(Black) is a great value

I bought the black because it matches the rest of my AV gear, but it's also available in silver
I got mine from a local retailer for 123, new

The on-screen menu is clear and easy to use
The manual is also easy to understand and well written

Set up was painless, I had it out of the box and playing with-in minutes

The remote is sleek/thin, easy to use, tons of buttons, and fits my hand well w/ the bottom finger groove
Some cool buttons are the (2x &amp; 4x) zoom and instant replay

It can be easily programmed to control the volume on your receiver(lacks a mute button) as well as control your TV.It features hi-fi

multichannel SACD - though unfortunately only playable through the analog 5.1 outputs, would be MUCH better if it was playable through the superior digital outs instead.(Running one wire is also a much cleaner install than having to run 6 for audio to the machine's rear) I hope they someday get this right.It features a list of various play modes, including program play, shuffle(random) play, repeat play, A-B repeat play
CD/DVD text compatible(if available)

Built-in dolby digital/DTS decoding, great for people who don't already have decoding in a receiver, lacks pro logic II decoding I've seen others have


Of course, selectable progressive scan.It has BOTH optical &amp; coaxial digital outs
Superior 108MHz/12 bit video DAC! 192kHz/24 bit audio DAC! Sony's new precision drive 3 system
40 disc resume memory- very convenient feature and a lot more than others offer! region 1 or all region/NTSC only


Built-in screen saver(after 15 min.)
Energy star! It shuts off after 30 min

of inactivity
Great feature! Power consumption is 14w


S/N 115db
Distortion: .003% Dynamic range: DVD video &amp; SACD =103db/CD=99db.Just a couple cons: lacks(higher end)HDMI output, doesn't play WMA, DVD-RAM, DVD-ROM, CD-ROM(photo CD format)or DVD-audio discs


However, it is extremely hard to find a player that's compatible w/ every single format out there
What it will play: DVD, CD, SACD, VCD, JPEG, Kodak picture CD, MP3, CD-R/RW, DVD +/- R/RW, CD-ROM(music CD/video CD format).Also, a personal issue, I still wish DVD players had built-in digital clocks like VCRs did
I also wish you had a choice to rotate the open tray either way when exchanging discs


Keep in mind the 5 disc models are quite a bit larger/wider than the single disc models, but they do offer you more flexibility in return.One final piece of advice, please use component video for your video signal (if you can) and invest in quality set of wires, like monster cable
S-Video is the next best thing

Composite aka A/V cables should NEVER be used for a DVD player, even though they are usually thrown in the box for free

Composite: Good for VCRs, Horrible for DVDs

 Anyways, hope my review helps..
this is a great product so go get one!

$REVIEW.: As I prepared to write this review I realized I don't think I've ever not liked a Belkin product.  They seem to see a need and either solve it in a creative way (iPod and iPhone accessories come to mind) or solve it by having their own quality version of a cable or a charger or whatever the product is.  The reason I bring this up is because this cable is another example of "the Belkin way".  They've made a quality, sturdy, snugly fitting cable that delivers video and images from your phone to your big screen TV.  The price has come down on this and even if it hadn't - the old "you get what you pay for" is true to a certain extent in cables.  Super cheap will not hold up.  Cheap will be fine for a while and for most folks longer.  Mid-range will almost always suffice (I am considering this cable in this category).  Pricey is almost always a waste of money (unless you have an ear/eye/system that really distinguishes between great and super great).  That's my opinion anyway, and I didn't notice anything but a clear picture on the pictures and videos streamed to the TV.

$review_text.: The tablet has some nice pros going for it


It has a nice feel and it runs smoothly depending on what you do with yours


I use mine while waiting  - I ride with people sometimes and read and I sit in the bed and want to lounge - and thought it worked really well for that
I do have to say that I was really surprised by how thick it was when I first got it, then even more surprised by how well it handled considering how thick the item is


There's a light-weight quality to it that allowed me to use it easily, tilting it this way and that while goofing off - I mean testing it
I suppose that's what Lite means.I want to also note that I'm tech-savvy enough to utilize an item, but I'm not going to quote specifications

There are other reviewers doing that and they seem really knowledgeable, so they're a better option for that
I tried the item out and tested it in the real world, using it at the doctor or during breaks or on the go, if that helps any.I played a lot of applications for trial and the tablet ran smoothly, not having some of the hiccups I've noticed in other items when it comes to smaller games
There were a few issues when it came to some of the larger games I've purchased, with the requirements making me pause as it lagged it certain spots
I could adjust settings and control the issues, but there was still so lag

Playback on videos online was nice and movies played great as well, never once having an issue


To me this was a big plus

I also read comics on my tablets, and while a 7 &amp;#34; screen is not the most optimal setup for it, the tablet does a great job with fill and with colors


That's always been an issue for me when using something like a Kindle - perhaps it has been fixed by now, but there was always a framing issue that bothered me
With this, no framing

You can always zoom on frames if so inclined to make up for a smaller screen, which I do with this one
I read a book on it while goofing off; the read went well as expected, which I didn't really doubt
Android readers have always done right by me


 Online use is good, no problems noted, with everything from directions to the restaurant to looking up random trivial working out.Other reviewers have mentioned the price, and that is one issue the tablet has going against it


It will get cheaper as time goes on, so while it is an issue while writing this, it won't be for long


Another thing is the 8 GB internal memory, but with the ability to connect a mini-SD to almost every device these days, it wasn't too much for me to consider for myself but something I felt worth noting


 I'm not a video-chatter so the lack of one camera does not bother me
I honestly have never liked a camera pointed at my face while using a device, but that's something you might want to look into if that is a selling/buying point.

$review_summary.: Nice tablet

$REVIEW.: I love this little computer.  The netbook is half the size and weight of my laptop, making it extremely portable. I've been taking it on all my travels since I got it. It is really true that the battery keeps it running for up to 8 hours, which is more than enough time for cross-country airline trips. Also, because of its small size, it easily fits on the tray table of my shrinking airline seat in the economy class, even if the person in front of me reclines (this is not true of my laptop). But the best thing is that this netbook runs real Windows-7 (as opposed to Windows-Light which many brands of netbooks run.)  This means that I am able to load it with my favorite programs and apps and it works great.  In other words, this little computer is not just for checking your email and surfing the web, but you can do real work with it.  The only downside is that it's not as fast as a top-of-the-line laptop for CPU intense tasks.  But you should not worry about this unless you play chess on your computer or solve differential equations, or run place and route for CAD tools.  I do those things, but not when I am traveling, and not on this little computer.I bought this computer five months ago, and I liked it immediately, but I waited until now to write a review.  I wanted to make sure that it will not have any issues.  I also wanted to make sure that I can install my favorite software on it and run that stuff reasonably well.  Considering its price, this is a great value.
$review_summary.: Very light weight and inexpensive netbook which runs real Windows

$REVIEW.: We love our chromebooks &amp; this would be the perfect web surfing device if it just had a touchscreen like my Acer c720p.  This little chromebook looks much more expensive than it is &amp; makes a great 2nd computer. The IPS screen on it coupled with the outstanding keyboard &amp; good trackpad is a step above most other chromebooks I've tried. However, I prefer my Acer slightly to this one due to the lack of a touchscreen.  I use a smartphone &amp; am use to tablets so that may matter to me more than most people.  This is still a great device at the price.Update - I've had a lot of keyboard problems with the Acer c720p in the form of some keys not working or only working now &amp; then. This thing though,works great &amp; I love the ability to charge this thing with my smart phone charger. NICE. As soon as Acer fixes or replaces my C720p I plan to sell it. I now have a high end Chromebook Pixel as my primary Chrome device (it is world class), but because I like this thing so much, I plan to keep it as a backup. Great screen, great keyboard &amp; touchpad, &amp; really attractive form factor.  If only it were a little more powerful with a faster chip. Still it is a great device to have on your lap as you watch tv, movies or YouTube. Highly recommended.Update - May 2014 I've been using both Chromebooks a lot since my last update &amp; as a result of OS updates to Chrome all of my keyboard related issues with the Acer c720p have dissappeared. Why I don't know but they have. At the same time, I still love this thing for it's portability, looks, &amp; keyboard. I find it great for texting &amp; e-mails. However anything much beyond that &amp; this thing slows down quickly or stops. Watching movies or videos on-line is pretty much a no go on this device. I've never managed to watch a two hour movie on this but if I did, my guess is it would take 4-5 hours &amp; the battery would be long gone before that happened. The IPS screen is still great, the keyboard is pretty good, but I"m now finding the track pad pretty weak. If this thing had a Haswell processor &amp; a bit better touchpad, &amp; as long as I'm wishing, a touch screen, then it would be an Ideal Chromebook. But now that I've had time to use it for a while, I plan to sell it or downstream it to one of my kids.  The processor makes it's ongoing use just too frustrating. Get a Dell or a Acer c720p if you like a touchscreen as much as I do.  If you can, I might wait for the summer to see how the newer models turn out. Faster processors &amp; more ram have to help the Chrome OS experience.

$REVIEW.: I was a little skeptical about ordering this ring as it was so reasonable compared to the Cokin adapters.  But, the quality was just fine, it fit the camera lense perfectly and the Cokin adapter slips on easily.  Bottom line - why pay more when you can get good quality for way less.  Plus the seller is excellent with good follow through and fast shipping.  I will buy from him again - not doubt.

$review_text.: Had the opportunity to use this little device over the holiday.  It does a very decent job, the quality of the sound however over my stereo system is not at the same level as what the same music sounds like in the car.  Now that may be that the auto sound system is not as picky as the AV system in my home, but for general listening and background music it works just fine.  For the audiophile who is used to listening to music via a high quality player it will not be the same.  Nor will it be as good as wiring your ipod or phone directly to your system with an audio plug and RCA plugs. This item does require direct line of sight between the source and the NFC receiver.  Even with your body between the two it will cut out, so you can't really carry your phone all over the house and have this device pick up the signal.
$review_summary.: Near CD quality, I'm not really sure, but don't think so.

$REVIEW.: The Good:- Great sound- Surprisingly stylish- Slide in/out mouthpiece ensures you won't lose your mic piece ever again- Comfortable with a smart and flexible head band- Works well with iPhone 4, so that you can answer phone calls and get back to listening without taking off the headsetThe Bad:- A learning curve involving the tiny switch that controls calls and music controls- Music can be heard outside the headphonesThe Bottom Line:First let's talk compatibility of this headset:The remote and mic is supported by iPod Nano(4th gen and newer,) Ipod Classic (120GB and 160GB,) iPod Touch(2nd gen and newer,) Ipad, Iphone(3GS and newer.  The remote only, but not mic is supported by iPod Shuffle(3rd gen and newer.  However, Audio itself is supported by all iPod models.This is a great set for your music needs.  A slide in and out mic piece is great.  If you don't need it, just slide it in and don't worry about losing it.  The thin cord is about 3.5 feet in length.  Learning the remote may take some time as different combination of clicks do different functions(click once to Play or Pause and fast-forward requires two click and a hold.  Headband is flexible and very comfortable.  It also long hair-friendly and a flexible band can hold the hair back and not let it escape.  I also found that music can escape and be audible by whoever is around you.  While this could be a plus for some, it can certainly be annoying for the rest of us who are not interested to hear what you are listening to.  Overall a solid choice if you often find yourself using an iPod and computer equally.

Are you tired of blaring commercials and their volume's increasing over your program setting?  Is dialog unclear or does background noise/music interfere with your hearing a character's speech?  If so, you may want to do what we did and purchase a ZVOX 555.Delivery, even with "super saver shipping" was quick and the unit arrived in pristine shape


 Set-up took only 5 minutes - the majority of that time was spent placing the unit; all required cables are included with the ZVOX 555
 Clear, concise directions allowed us to program control, using our cable provider's remote, the ZVOX 555 - no multiple remotes needed here.As tone-deaf, non-audiophiles, we were amazed by the depth of tone and clarity of sound the ZVDOX 555 produced


 Our "mature" ears can now hear voices clearly - since receiving our ZVOX 555 we no longer have to ask "what did they say?"  (We set the unit on "SD1" which minimizes surround sound and emphasizes vocals


 Most individuals will prefer the "SD2" setting" as it provides a truer surround sound.)  Further, the conflict regarding the volumes which we individually prefer and set has disappeared; we now agree on that point
 The ZVOX 555's best feature may be the way it controls the volume on commercials so that their volume are no louder than the volume of the program you are watching.We like the ZVOX 555 so much that we plan on purchasing a second one
 Budget conscious individuals may want to purchase, as we did, a ZVOX refurbished unit on Amazon

 The savings is significant and ZVOX's customer service is as responsive as Amazon's.NOVEMBER 15 UPDATE:  We have had our second ZVOX 555 for a week and it is every bit as nice a unit as the first one

 We thought it was not working correctly and called ZVOX; they were extremely nice and very helpful
 We learned that you need to use your TV's remote to go to settings where you need to turn the TV speakers "off."  You will then get another option, such as "auxiliary," which will make the ZVOX your audio source


 The instructions do not tell you that tidbit; hopefully, this will help others who, like my spouse and me, do not use sound systems or are moving to the new technologies.

$REVIEW.: I bought these because somebodies at the company spent a lot of time, research and development creating this product if they were willing to charge that much for them originally. These are very well made, light but substantial. They fit nicely in your ear; look fine( c'mon they're just earbuds!). The sound you hear whether turned up or down is crystal clear. What you hear is what it would sound like if it was played live( thumpy if recorded that way, trebly if meant to sound that way). The music seems projected beyond you. I have had about 70 hours logged on them and, all I can say, is they are simply amazing.

So let me fill you in on some serious quality issues I have seen after owning a pair for about 6 years (in the order the events occured). Mind you I have always babied these things and kept them in the hard case, so thats why I find this particulary disturbing (well, that, and the fact that they cost $300).1. About 3 years ago, as I was adjusting the headband, I noticed that the plastic had broken where the two pieces slide into one another. It was bad enough that crazy glue was not an option. So I contacted Bose fully expecting to be able to get them repaired or replaced for a reasonable fee. No such luck. The Bose rep told me I could purchase another pair, period. He may have offered a discount, but it must not have been a very good discount because I recall ripping him a new one for such bad support. I was going to throw them away, but I took one more look at the damage and decided the try to fix the broken area with some tightly wound electrical tape. This worked well enough, so I kept them, determined to get a few more months out of them.2. About a year ago I noticed that the on/off switch was intermittant. You have to push extra hard to the right to get the red light to come on. Wierd, but I can live with that.3. This past weekend I placed the headphone earpieces down on my dads fine wood clothing bureau and when I picked them up a few hours later I noticed that some of the soft cushion had stuck to the wood! It appears that the cushion is deteriorating!! There were little black cushion bits everywhere. There was nothing on the wood surface to cause this, except possibly for some very light wood polish.Now, these things would be forgivable if this was a cheap pair of headphones, but this is BOSE for gosh sakes, and these cost $300! Whats up with that? You buy a brand like Bose precisely becuase you assume the quality after 6 years will be excellent, not just fair or good.So, yes, the sound quality is very good. And I am sure they have made some design changes in the past 6 years. But the overall quality of the pair that I have is  most certainly NOT good. Have they addressed all of these issues in the current model? I have no idea. The BOSE rep did not tell me about if they did. But based on my experience I am very dissapointed in BOSE and will never again waste my hard earned money on a pair of thier headphones again. There are plenty of other noise cancelling headphones out there that are just as good, for alot less $$. My advice is shop around and consider this review before you fork over big bucks for these headphones.

$review_text.: I wasnt sure if I should get this since my first Koss product was terrible. It was the cheapest Koss earbud, but they were terrible, even unbranded 3 or 4$ headphones give much better sound. But after I read the reviews for this one, I decided to give it a shot since they were quite cheap. They are really good. Now I know why Koss have such a big name. These are easily the best over the ear type headphones around, alteast within this price bracket. The sound is crisp, mids and highs are clear. Bass lacks punch, not ideal for hip hop or techno, but great for rock music. The headphones sit neatly over the ear. They are a bit bulky and the plastic clip seems slightly flimsy. But I've had it for a while and it hasnt broken yet, so maybe I am wrong. One thing though, these wont fit in jeans pockets, which I find quite annoying on several occasions, but otherwise these rock.

$review_text.: I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSandisk Ultra 32GB Class 10 Micro SD Card (SDSDQU-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of 12.6MB/s according to "CrystalDiskMark" (see my uploaded picture in `Customer Images' section for details). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using "Flash Memory Toolkit" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card is priced similar to other (slower) class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. TheLexar microSDHC 300x 32GB UHS-I(LSDMI32GBBNL300R) is faster , but it is priced nearly twice as much. So I consider this Sandisk card the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as "2 to the power 30", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.

I would have preferred the fancy kind which allows the tiny wires to pass right through the front of the connector in order to verify the colors (before being trimmed off), but those are significantly more expensive and may have required a much more costly crimping tool. These work reliably, though my water-resistant Cat-6 cable is so thick and tough that I had to carefully trim out the inner casing before the outer casing would fit into the connector for crimping; I suspect that would be true of most all standard RJ45 connectors.

I love it and use it more than I ever anticipated simply because it's so amazingly capable and portable. I have  other computers, Macs, PCs, laptops, etc. but use this gem almost as much as any of them.Most of the reviews below helped enormously in my choice of the Asus over Acer, HP, and the like. But, I came across some concerns or criticisms that gave me pause too so I wanted to comment on my experience with a couple of them.First, the sound quality. I use Koss portaPro headphones (~ $33 @ Amazon) and have to keep the system and browser volume levels at about 50% otherwise it's uncomfortably loud. The frequency response is excellent up and down the spectrum. No one would really purchase something the size of the Asus and expect the built-in speakers to sound exemplary, would they? Really? Seriously? Get good headphones. They're not expensive.Second, keyboard size. I have hands large enough that I can palm a basketball. They fit the keyboard nicely. You just have to be a bit careful. And practice. Small price to pay.Lastly, this didn't cause me concern but I find it bewildering and it comes up frequently below like it's important.Someone purchases a piece of technology like this. It has about a gazillion times more computing power than NASA had for the moon landing but its form factor is smaller than your average college textbook. To boot, it costs about the same as 11 tanks of gas. With all the technical capabilities contained in that package, at that price, you'd logically expect somebody to take issue with the fact that it shows fingerprints, right? That's like buying a Rolls Royce then complaining because its upholstery shows lint.Yup. Rest assured. The Asus shows fingerprints. My car shows water spots after I drive it in the rain too. Life ain't easy.

$review_text.: I bought this for my new HTC One V mobile phone from Virgin Mobile


 32GB is the max my phone is supposed to take, and this was the best price I found for a 32GB SD card
 You can get faster 32GB cards, but since my phone is set up for Class 2 or Class 4, why spend more money for a faster card than my phone can use?  I've had this card for a couple on months now, and I've had zero problems
 It works just fine, and it didn't cost that much, so it's another good deal on Amazon for me.Update 8 May 2014:  Amazon only lets you review a product one time, regardless of how many times you buy it


Fortunately, they let you buy it as much as you want, so I've now purchased 4 additional SanDisk 32GB microSD class 4 cards over the past 2 years


And each card has performed flawlessly


Two of them went into Nook HD and HD+ tablets, which allows my wife and me to run CyanogenMod Android as part of a dual boot system


(See [...] if you're looking for an excellent way to do this.) The others went into my wife's phone and our grandson's Chinese Android tablet


The Nook applications in particular are very demanding, and some other brands of memory cards simply don't work in Nooks -- but SanDisk cards have worked perfectly, and they have also worked perfectly in our phones and our grandson's tablet.Best card for the money

Buy it once, rely on it to work for a long time...and smile

It's as simple as that.

The mouse has weight. Its huge, its bulky. Some people may like it, but I don't. My previous mouse wasMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000and I felt that that mouse hit the sweet spot in terms of the weight strain I wanted to put on my hands.Back on topic, excluding that one con, the G700 is full of win. As with my previous mouse, the "Plug-in Nano Receiver" doesn't stick out of the USB port reducing the risk of accidentally clipping it. The scrolling wheel has two settings which can be changed at the press of a button, freespin and "notched" spin mode. The freespin mode allows you to scroll down a page without the worry of friction on the wheel (much beneficial in gaming mode). The "notched" mode adds some friction to the wheel and would better be suited when browsing through long pages.Moving on to the one thing Logitech advertises about the mouse the most, buttons. Yes, there are indeed a lot of buttons. Downside is that you will barely use them unless you play a lot of MMORPGS (which unfortunately, I don't). Anyways, I popped in a game of Crysis to observe the results and compare it with my older mouse. I can barely explain them in technical terms, but the response times were amazing, a lot better than my previous mouse. No missed hits, no blaming on the lag. The mouse is set at 500 reports/second right out of the box, but can go as high as 1000.Being a gaming mouse, this thing is designed for comfort, which I believe degrades the overall look. The battery is rechargeable and it comes with a cable to do so. The cable port is same as a HTC HD2's, so if you happen to lose it, you know what to look for. There is a button designed to change the speed of the mouse without having to go to the Control Panel every time. The box was enclosed in a frustration-free packaging, which is a big plus too.Overall, I would really recommend this mouse, but you will have to do some getting used to if your previous mouse is as small as mine.

$REVIEW.: I replaced all the office Pentium/CRT units with Atoms/LCD displays and saw our power consumption cut by 50%. But a recent client required us to work with several Excel sheets with a total or 300,000 rows and the Atom started to bog down and VLOOKUPs started freezing on me.I stumbled upon this great board in Amazon and promptly setup a test unit with a Core i3-520 and 4Gb RAM - the speed at which those Excel files loaded/worked blew me away.I'm using the on-board DVI output coupled with a low-profile Radeon 4350 video card for a dual-monitor setup. For applications that requires raw processing power, productivity is definitely way better than the Atoms without sacrificing power efficiency.The Core i3, on-chip HD graphics capability, HDMI port, and power-efficient design makes this a much better choice as a HTPC than the Atoms as it doesn't choke on 1080p or Blu-ray movies.A great compromise between power consumption, processing power, and price!

Taking the place of my JVC DVM70U, Canon S100 &amp;amp; Olympus Camedia 700 (all of which I like), the 2100 had a lot of big shoes to fill. First of all, I bought it for the 27x zoom, which from the sidelines is absolutely necessary to get into the action, and for its built-in stabilization system, the lack of which made long range zoom shots frequently blurry in the JVC &amp;amp; Camedia 700. I bought an extra set of batteries, a nice, leather Olympus case and a 128 meg SmartMedia card.I spent about 2 hours with the fairly complicated and not too well written manual before gametime. I pretty much had decided to leave the camera in its 'sports setting&amp;quot; for my first night,  which is accessible easily through the thumbwheel control knob atop the camera body (though this requires a little time in the setup menu, which I found pretty intuitive).Well, 48 plus minutes later I had shot 83 pics at a medium resolution (1024 x 768), and about 12 30 second QuickTime movies at low resolution (320 x 240). There was still a ton of room left on the 128 meg card, and the batteries were still juiced!The camera was easy to operate, easy to hold and the new electronic viewfinder is about as nice as it gets. The zoom was fine as frog's hair.When I got home, I installed the nice software package and connected the camera via the USB cable (supplied). Downloading took about 5 minutes (BTW, I ordered a SmartMedia FlashPath reader, but you-know-who didn't get it here on time, despite the overnight shipping charge...but I digress) and playback was a cinch. All in all, the photo quality was very good, though I think I can do better at freezing the action than the so-called &amp;quot;sports program&amp;quot; did. The QuickTime movies, even at the lower of the two resolutions available, were magnificent; they were better than the JVC digital camcorder and the sound was really high quality.Now this is no point and shoot, but if you have a little time and interest, I think the 2100 represents a great multipurpose digicam.

$REVIEW.: I have had this Oppo unit for almost a year

I think there are tons of other reviews covering the great aspects of the unit: easy to use, great image quality, excellent sound, and so on


In this case, I would like to add some words about Customer Service.As most of the professional BD players, manufacturers, Oppo distributes firmware updates via the Internet for feature enhancements and bug fixes


With the last update, there was something wrong with my unit and it basically started to have a faulty operation
I send an email to Oppo and in matter of hours they respond with additional diagnostic questions and suggestions
After some other emails, they realized the problem was a serious one
There is where their excellent service started

I'm outside USA and most of the manufacturers have limitations in the service that they provide to international customers if they don't have local branches
Oppo don't change their standards with me

They send me a UPS label to send my unit free of charge; they even take care of the customs paperwork

My duties were reduced to pack and drop the unit on an UPS office near home
Once they received the unit, they fix it in ONE DAY and the next day the unit was on the road to my home
They documented what the fix and provide me with some extra goodies that may be of nominal value but a very nice touch.Why consider this an excellent service? I quoted the cost of sending the unit via the same services Oppo provided me for free

It represented to Oppo about the 50% of the selling price! I'm sure they lost money with me! Did they try to charge me for the shipping, partially or completely? NEVER.Tech issues always happened
What you do to correct these is what makes the difference
For me, Oppo not creates excellent players; they also cover their international customers with the same level of support as domestic customers


That said a lot of a company

I had a complain with my Bose HT system six months ago..

I'm still waiting for a decent response from them.My next BluRay will be Oppo..


OF COURSE!

$review_text.: I wanted a low-bulk cover for my four-year old Canon SX10 superzoom camera.  This one is a great value.  I already do well with a neoprene cover for my much more precious DSLR, so there was no reason not to get one for my aged-but-trusty compact.  This case allows me to pack the camera into a backpack or just keep it ready when I'm traveling or biking.  It probably won't protect the camera from the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; drop, but I'm pretty careful.The one drawback is that the lens doesn't really &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; of the case, so it's &amp;#34;floppy.&amp;#34;  You'll also have to pack extra batteries somewhere else, but I'm OK with that, too.Others have dinged this product because the case is &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34; for the camera.  I'm used to neoprene cases in which you have to stretch the case around the camera.My case also came with a handy velcro &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; piece around one of the fasteners so you can make it &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; handed or &amp;#34;left&amp;#34; handed.  I didn't expect that feature, and I like it, mostly for when I reverse the case inside out.  That way, the fastener stays on the side I want it.

I'm also able to have zippered pockets for various SD cards, usb sticks, converters etc. My only gripe about this case is the pocked on the outside. I wish they would've put a zipper on it because it feels very loose and things my fall out of the pocket easily. Aside from that this case gives me a lower profile than the timbuk2 flexito accessory bag. This meant even though it was larger it didn't puff up my backpack the way the timbuk2 one did.

anywhere and everywhere


Case Logic's case is sturdy, well-made, classy looking, and easy to clean, and I'll definitely be using it anytime I'm packing my Kindle Fire in preparation for a serious beating
But it doesn't provide the kind of instant, easy access to my Kindle that I like for everyday use
Not only does it require two hands and a concerted effort to get the Kindle out of the case, but the Velcro flap is really loud


That Velcro opening sound was really cool on my 80's Trapper Keeper, but not so much now when I want to sneak my Kindle out at the back of a too-long meeting and instead end up causing every head in the room to turn.Anyway, while I recommend this case for frequent travelers and other folks who are rough on their Kindles, it has limited use for me

For everyday storage, I much prefer the soft-sidedBUILT Kindle Fire Slim Neoprene Sleeve Case, Lush Flower, which I've owned for a couple of months and absolutely love

It's cute, protects my screen from scratches and dirt, and, most importantly, lets me get at my Fire quickly and easily

$REVIEW.: I bought this case due to recommendation by my brother in law, who's an IT guy. Not sure what so many are complaining about, look at what you get for the price. I didn't even realize it came with its own power supply. I used it as a test PSU for the following configuration and it powered the MB just fine.I'm using the case for my home server, which houses my micro ATX AMD A55M P33 motherboard, AMD A8 3850 FM1 Fusion 2.9 GHz quad core APU w Raedon HD6550D DX11, Logisys 550w power supply unit, 4 Western Digital 3.5" SATA Green drives, and an ASUS BD optical drive.It came with one of the power leads detached, but that was an easy fix. The case was not damaged in any way. The metal is thin and very light. Have to kind of work it a bit to get the side access panels to sit properly but that's no big deal, either. Motherboard fit perfectly out of the box. Had no issues replacing the rear panel connection cutouts with the ones that came with my MB. The two front USB ports are 3.0.Looks very good sitting as a headless server in our home network. I like the LED light, also.

$review_text.: I posted my inital review for the right product under a different supplier.  My bad sorry, but I did purcase this card as you can see with the verified purchaser tag.I have an Nikon D90. I purchased the 8G San Disc Extreme III card 30MB/S and a Transcend 16G class 6 card at the same time. The San Disc Extreme 3 card is incredibly fast. I get 100 pictures (4.5 frames per second) at fine resolution before the camera stops to buffer in 24 seconds. The Transcend card gets 17 photos on the same settings then pauses to buffer. If you have the camera that can take full advantage of this write speed this fast card is worth the investment. No more cringing while I wait for my camera to clear its buffer so I can take more pictures.I like to shoot at 4.5 frames. It gives me a lot to pick through when I edit, but a lot can happen in a fraction of a second that can make a photo good or bad. Having the capability to hold down the shutter release and rattle off large bursts of photos is important to me.I have found that 8G is a good size for SLR Photography. In my opinion bigger cards are putting a lot of eggs in one basket.I posted a video test demonstrating this products incredible write speed.  You can find it by clicking on my name and searching for this product.  I'd repost it here but I deleted from my computer.I have been using the card for several months.  I have about 10 different cards that I use and I can honestly say that this is my favorite.  In addition to writing fast it emptys a lot faster which comes in handy when I'm in a hurry to leave the house with my fastest card and it's full of pictures.  I have not had any write/read errors.  I'd get another one, but I know the price on this model will continue to fall.

$review_text.: Just out of curiosity I took out a nikon 17-55mm F2.8 and a tokina 11-16mm F2.8 for a test comparison because of the hype about this tokina lens.I tested nikon at 17mm vs 16mm for tokina both at F2.8 and the rest of the settings otherwise the same. Nikon just blew Tokina in terms of sharpness.When I compared Nikon 12-24mm F4 vs Tokina 11-16mm F2.8 both set at F4 and all the other parameters being the same...the sharpness results of the two lenses were comparable although on visual evaluation nikon lens was a tad sharper vs tokina.....there goes my first hand experience of the lens......

$REVIEW.: This card is just what I've been looking for.  I've been using the Gmyle card for a while, but after updating to 10.9, that card would no longer work, even after installing the USB3 drivers from Multibeast.  I could have searched around for more drivers, but honestly, all the hassle that came with that card just wasn't worth it.  In order to recognize a new drive plugged in, the old card would need you to shut down (or sleep) your laptop, then wake it up, THEN you could use your new drive.With this card, I can simply plug in the USB DC power cable, then pop in the expresscard itself with my USB3 hard drive plugged in, and it shows up instantly on my desktop.  I love when things just work!  The Fresco chipset is to thank for that, since OSX has native support for Fresco.I'm even getting faster speeds with this card than I was with the Gmyle card, likely due to the USB power assistance, and the native support.  You'll experience the best results with a laptop with ExpressCard 2.0, since it has a single PCIe 1.0 2.5Gbps land AND a USB3 5Gbps link.Anyhow, if you have a 2011 MacBook Pro with ExpressCard, this card pretty much eradicates the need for a laptop upgrade.  My 2.3GHz Sandy Bridge quad-i7 puts out almost as much horsepower as the current lineup, and even more than Haswell in some situations, so with USB3, my antiglare 17&amp;#34; MBP is the ultimate machine.

$review_text.: 1. Do not use the drivers supplied on the CD, they do not work.2. If you are running ZoneAlarm you MUST uninstall ZoneAlarm first!!!3. Search the Alfa website for the latest drivers for this model.4. Download and install drivers.5. Test internet access and if successful, re-install ZoneAlarm.In short, there are waaay more user friendly USB wireless adapters out there, I don't recommend this one.Finally, it does do a decent job of picking up our AP in the basement from the upstairs.  But, you can get the same results with other adapters and an upgraded 5-9 dBi &amp;#34;rubber ducky&amp;#34; antenna.

Even with the player's volume and the headphone volume switch all the way up, it is not loud enough for me


That's probably due to the on-ear rather than in-ear design that I'm used to with buds


Also, if you're hoping for something to drown out noise, this is not for you
I hope they work for me on the airplane to drown out white noise, but I'm skeptical that they will
Also, those around you can easily hear what you are listening to
I wouldn't buy them again

$REVIEW.: I'm a proud owner of a few Canon digital SLRs, and the biggest gripe is that with the HD video, my shaky hands produces virtually unusable video. I've been eying up a shoulder rig for quite some time, but I couldn't get over the sticker shock of Zacuto products and was too lazy to go down the DIY road.The Cinevate Simplis Solo is a nice little simple shoulder rig. Getting it to fit me and my Canon 5dm2 was rather easy, despite the instructions being pretty disappointing. After a bit, there was an initial discomfort with the rig that I just chalked up to not having used a shoulder rig before.The rig did offer a decent improvement with filming but it wasn't as silky smooth as I had imagined they would be. It definitely helps, and for "run and gun" shooting, this would be nice. Since I do travel a lot, the rig was fairly easy to break down and put in my bag but it took up a decent amount of room in my bag.I do appreciate the modularity of the Cinevate system. Eventually, I could expand my rig to accommodate a larger camera, a viewfinder and other accessories. Granted, this will start to add up pricewise, but serious amateurs and budding filmmakers would like this system. I'm pleased with my Simplis Solo, something I really didn't plan on thinking. 4 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty cool basic dSLR rig for video

$REVIEW.: Interestingly, the earpads are much smaller than I was expecting based on the photo which is good I guess. They seem comfortable, but the sound is so lackluster that I have not bothered wearing them for more than a few minutes.  I would say that the sound quality is better then a telephone speaker, but not by much.  They are adequate for listening to talking, but I would not consider them for music at all.

$REVIEW.: I have owned a Canon 10D for about 3 yeas now and in that time have shot over 12,000 pictures at NASCAR Races, Railroad Photography, Other Sports and Waterfalls.  I only used 1 Memory Card in that camera the entire time, the 1GB Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash card.  I have never once lost a photo, or had an error to write to the card.  I do a lot of rugged hiking and my camera (while in the bag) has fell a few times and all the data was still there when I got home to put the pictures onto my computer.  When I shoot Multiple Shots...it takes 9 to fill up my Camera Buffer...the thing doesn't hesitate to write.  I can fire em all off, and then start shooting again seconds later with a completely clear buffer (they are decently fast cards).  The card can hold roughly 400 High/Fine JPEG on the 10D (pending ISO and other settings).  I am buying a 5D soon so will probably upgrade to a 2.0GB Sandisk Ultra II CF because when I travel I take loads of Photos.  And 1GB won't hold quite that many at 12.8MP...and I may start shooting RAW too.  I recommend Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash cards over anything else.  They are priced right, and work.

$review_text.: Even though the build is flimsy and it feels awkward when using it, I still wanted to give this a shot. So I got it when on sale for cheap. The killer for me is the pointer's accuracy. It seems to have the mind of its own and roams and jumps around the screen as it pleases. Even when you are not even touching the mouse, the pointer jiggles around. not good at all.Didn't worth the cost of the return shipping. I just bought another small size regular Bluetooth mouse to replace it.

The Kindle 3, when paired with the standard cover with light, weighs about the same amount as the much larger, heavier Kindle DX (albeit with no cover on the DX, but still). It seems odd to me that the standard Kindle cover would be so heavy when they did such a remarkable job shrinking the Kindle itself and making it so light.So, not being satisfied with the standard cover, I purchased this Built sleeve. It seems to be the perfect Kindle 3 cover. It is extremely lightweight (significantly lighter than the standard cover), seems to be well made, and provides adequate protection. The inside is lined with what feels like soft microfiber fur that protects the screen from scratches etc.There's not much else to be said. If you're looking for a fancy leather cover that looks fancy and weighs a ton, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an extremely lightweight sleeve that happens to look nice and provide adequate protection, look no further. The only con I can think of is it's a little on the expensive side for what it is, but by no means do I regret buying it, and I would buy one again at the standard price in a heartbeat.

I held my breath and put in the first floppy. I opened the floppy from &amp;#34;My Computer,&amp;#34; and there were all of my old documents -- which I was actually able to open and convert to a modern format.I only needed to use this drive once, so I didn't want to spend much money, but on the other hand, I needed something that would work, and preferably without having to deal with installing new drivers for it.

$review_text.: This product works great.  Prior to testing I connected it up to Ethernet and ran its built in Software Update.  After installing the latest firmware I began testing.  It played back every disc I tried with no problems.  The quality of the display is excellent.  The only things I can find wrong with this unit is the mechanism is slightly loud and so the volume has to be turned up to cover it.  The case of the unit and the remote control look a little out of date in that they resemble some product designs that came out of Sony way back in the nineties.  But so what.

$REVIEW.: The ONLY relative negative to this tripod is that it's rather expensive for a tiny tripod. Roughly double to triple the trivial price tripods in the tiny genre demand. This, however, isn't much of a concern if you're more than just a casual hobbyist. In all honesty, I use this tripod more than I do my other tripods, and that includes my $500 carbon Manfrotto. It is easily my least expensive tripod and I use it the most by far.This, in my opinion, is a professional's secret weapon for backpacking/camping/travel/difficult-to-get-to locations without a crew. If you must pack light, really light, this tripod is a lifesaver for light to medium-weight gear as you otherwise wouldn't be packing ANY tripod.My main initial concern with this pod was how well the tiny ballhead would do with a medium SLR on it. Um, REALLY WELL, that's how! :O I even put my D700 with 28-300 on it and it holds like a champ at all angles and is SMOOTH. Now, this has got to clearly be right at the limit of what this little pod is rated or limited at, but who is really going to load such a tiny pod up with such heavy gear? My D7000 with 18-200 (yes, different rig from D700 with 28-300 but still of heft) is held just fine on it. When using full-size SLRs though, a more stable tripod would be preferred. For point and shoots, this head is way overkill.The leg quick-release levers are strong and smooth and work great. All other controls hold very well though the neck's screw never really seems tight and this could lead to overtightening. Moderate screw tightness combined with the neck's barrel tightener provide solid neck locking.You have to understand that such a light tripod will by physical nature not be real steady and fall victim to breezes. This will be true of every tiny/lightweight tripod, not just this one. If you're shooting with the legs extended, you will want to use your self-timer so that you don't cause vibration by pressing the shutter button with your finger. If your camera can take a cable release or  has a remote control release, USE IT. Hanging a little weight on the tripod (camera and hanging weight combined should TOTAL about 5 pounds) or gently pressing down on the base would help also.Now, it does not get very tall. I assume you know this since you're looking at tiny tripods and that this is okay with you. You'll be shooting from around waist-level without extension or chest level with full extension. As long as this does not limit you, you'll love this tripod. If you need a full-height tripod, none of this tripod's virtues will matter.My criteria for this (my casual hiking/travel) tripod was that with head it be under 2 pounds and not more than 18 inches when compacted. This tripod met that criteria coming in 1/4 pound lighter and 4 full inches more compact than my very exclusive criteria. It is the ONLY tripod of any quality to meet that criteria and though I was ready make a lot of sacrifices to meet such stringent criteria, I really got GREAT quality and respectable stability! This tiny ballhead holds tilt positions stronger than my $150 Manfrotto 327RC2 grip head. I'm not exaggerating at all. The 327RC2, relying on spring pressure to grip the ball, actually will slip with heavier gear that the Slik Mini II clamp ballhead will hold. My D700 with 28-300 is the perfect example. That rig is really too much for the 327RC2 at tilt angles but this little clamp ballhead will hold the position.I permanently leave mine in my light hiking/travel backpack with my waterproof point and shoot (Lumix TS2)... because you never know when that once-in-a-lifetime rainbow or flower shot or great background for a self-portrait will present itself. 80 bucks for lots of photos you otherwise wouldn't get. Money well-spent. :)Seriously, if you need a tiny tripod, you're not going to do better than this one. You're not. I truly have to repeat this: you will NOT find a better tiny tripod than this one. Period. Even if you spend more. More expensive alternatives come in bigger and heavier. This is the tiniest and lightest with such impressive capabilities. It is an ideal travel tripod that you can actually take around with you because of its size and weight. Anything bigger/heavier becomes burdensome. Anything smaller is a TOTAL joke and doesn't even do a good job holding tiny point and shoots and keep your fingers crossed that it doesn't break after first use. Even other tripods around this size are total garbage that don't function well and break in no time. This is a SMART, very well-designed purposeful tripod designed to be used and used and used by photographers! Its tiny size, its greatest attribute, means that you actually WILL be packing a tripod when you otherwise wouldn't be. Like I said, mine's in my backpack taking up next to no space and I don't even know it's there... until I need it. ;)

$REVIEW.: Do you want thrills?  Excitement?  An experience beyond all others that you will take with you for the rest of your life that you will tell your grandchildren about with baited breath?Well you're out of luck, this is a small leather belt carrying case for a camera or ipod.  It provides none of those things, just basic functionality.  You put things in it, the Velcro snaps, they stay there and it holds.I can't say it's much better or worse than any other I've seen, Yeah it's a case, yeah it does the job, it looks ok, black goes with everything.So it's not all that exciting, but it holds the camera.  Then again you could take the camera ON a great adventure and this would hold it while you record those thrills and adventures.  So maybe it's more exciting than I thought.

When I originally wrote a review I was still waiting for the 200-400mm lens.  I now have the 200-400mm VR lens.  It is huge, but fits perfectly in the Vertex 300 AW.  I also have carried a Nikon 17-55mm F2.8 lens, Kenko 1.4 teleconverter, Nikon 12-24mm F4 and many accessories.  The Nikon 200-400mm lens comes with a pretty extravagant case that holds only the lens.  I really needed a backpack that would accommodate the lens mounted on my Nikon D200 camera and an additional camera with lens mounted and accessories.This case is huge, but I probably will not use it if I am not carrying the 200-400mm lens.  In that case I would continue to use my Lowepro AW Mini Trekker which works just fine for the rest of my lens and camera combinations.

 It is a hotspot, not exclusive to IPODs, although the 2nd and 3rd gen will fit in the device the 4 gen will not fit
 The 4 gen will still connect just like it would to any hotspot
 Most hotspots connect more than two devices, but at the same time are much more expensive
 I think this device is a great idea, but a little ahead of the hardware available to it.Cons: Set up is awkward
Needs a new model to fit gen 4


 Needs better on/off/standby switch
 Charge does not last very long, but most mobile hotspots don't last more than a few hours

Needs a removable sync port cover so IPOD's can dock or use sync cable
More data plan options needed


1gig is good for web browsing and email, but that's it


Overuse charges are insane, maybe tracking app/software should be included.Suggestion: Needs better integrated way to charge so you don't need yet another cable to charge the peel as well as the ipod(maybe have a connector in the peel for the ipod sync port that will allow you to use the peel charger to charge the peel and the ipod while installed at the same time).

The microphone I am reviewing does NOT look like the image on the product listing.  It has an additional red LED that indicates transmit power when you key it down.I have owned Ham Radio gear since 1992, probably numbering in the tens of thousands of dollars.  I've used everything from an original HW-101 to the Icom ID-800H and everything in between, including thousands of dollars worth of HTs and accessories.This is the first time I have purchased an accessory and shipped it back IMMEDIATELY.PROS:  The transmit audio from this microphone is &amp;#34;average.&amp;#34;  It is a little warm for my taste, but it is &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;  It is not punchy, it is not anything to write home about in the clarity department.  The receive audio is &amp;#34;average.&amp;#34;  When compared to my Pryme SM-101 (an aftermarket mini mic I bought a few years ago for my Kenwood TH-F6A), it is neither as loud nor as clear as the Pryme.  It is &amp;#34;durable enough,&amp;#34; with a case that is neither stronger than nor weaker than any other aftermarket &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; mic I've ever purchased.CONS:  BUT...  The biggest flaw of this mic is the after-release CLICK you can hear on the transmitted audio.  If you release the button juuuuust right you release the carrier before the click kicks in.  But if you release the button the way most people would - just let 'er go - you hear a LOUD &amp;#34;CHIRP!&amp;#34; on the receiving end of the signal.  In an EmComm or public service situation, that would get monotonous REALLY quickly.Until they figure out how to kill the transmit audio BEFORE the mechanical &amp;#34;CLICK!&amp;#34; kicks in, I would NOT recommend buying this microphone.

The volume buttons are not hard to press and they click

If you try to get a click from it, then you will need to push hard, but it is better to accept that without the click it works fine! This is not a drawback at all! I am actually starting to feel the click on the iPhone 3G a bit odd.

$REVIEW.: I got this product with the hope that I can use it with the SD cards and make a bootable CF card for HTPCs, as the combination is much cheaper than the native CF cards.I quickly found out that for some BIOS, the adapter is not seen by the system (Intel Atom based), thus deems unusable. For the systems that recognize the card (AMD based), it shows up as SD/CF adapter which is fine; I then proceeded with software installation which takes about 45 minutes. The card worked fine to start with, but toward the end, the installation stopped. I rebooted the system and the card was no longer seen. Powered everything off, I switched in a native CF, and everything worked again. After couple of tries, I realized that once the card got heated up, it ceased to operate. This is in a fanless system, and the CPU temperature is only 50C. At first I thought my SD card is not suitable for hot environment, but the spec of the SD card is for -25C to 85C, and the fact that a native CF card functions fine in the slot led me to believe that the adapter is not fit for the embedded environment where temperature may get above 50C.Other than the embedded PCs, I used it is a reader of a PC as a storage device, and it functions fine there.

$review_text.: We were using the little Channel Master Metro and getting solid green bars on all the major channels, but the low-power stations were just shy of green
With this antenna, up a little higher and pointed in exactly the same direction, we lost green on one of the majors and saw several of the other local stations lose green as well.Besides that, there was also a missing thumb screw in the box and IMO, at more than 2X the price of an antenna by the same manufacturer that works better, this one is a loser.

$review_text.: Dare I confess? I do not have a home theater. What I do have is tons of computer equipment--processor, laser printer, inkjet printer, scanner, and more. Even an electric typewriter. Therefore, I'm happy to now have all this equipment plugged into one power strip (a more obvious everyday use than surge protection, my need for which is hopefully infrequent but certainly vital) rather than two. Frankly, it's hard to improve on the manufacturer's description--there's nothing this surge protector lacks. It's a nice sturdy unit--it does not fall over when those two tiers are full of plugs, even plugs with adaptors. I don't need the labels (grouping components by usage) but for people who do, the labels are printed on and so will never peel off. It's a win!

$review_text.: If you're looking at the Lowepro SlingShot camera bags for the first time, I will start by telling you a bit about how they are meant to be worn.  This is a backpack with a single shoulder strap.  The strap sits on your right shoulder, diagonally crosses the front of your body, and attaches to the bag again at your left side.  The idea is that you can "sling" (pull) the bag around from your back to your front without ever having to take it off.  The bag is designed in such a way that when you do this, the side of the bag becomes the top, and the main compartment and zippers are facing you for quick access to you gear.  Because of the single "across the body" strap design, the backpack will never sit perfectly straight on your back, rather at a slight angle.  To compensate this, there is a padded waist belt, which helps straighten the pack and distribute the load.The 302AW is divided into two sections; the main compartment (measuring 11.4w x 5.9d x 10.6h") being for your SLR camera (or other gear), and a smaller, top compartment for personal items.  There is also a third pouch pocket on the front for things like your wallet, keys, pens, cellphone.  In addition, there are plenty of  elasticized straps, loops, netted and zippered areas all your smaller items (like flash cards, lens filters), all designed to keep everything organized and easily accessible.  The built-in lens cleaning cloth has a use, but it cannot be removed for laundering.  Same goes for the built-in rain cover, which is a bit of a double-edged sword.  If you're caught in a sudden rainstorm, it's great that you can pull it out of the bottom of the bag, and stretch it over to protect your gear, but you will likewise have to leave it hang out, flapping in the breeze, to dry because it's stitched in.The SlingShot 302AW has ample padding in all the right places to make it comfortable to wear and to protect your gear.  Although built for photographers and intended primarily as a camera bag, on another day this versatile backpack could be used for anything, by anyone after a backpack that you don't have to remove to access.  The modular Velco spacers in the main compartment can be easily reconfigured any way you like.  I reconfigured mine to carry a 10.1" netbook, compact camera, iPod, and all the associated power and USB cables, and  still have room to spare.  It's carry-on compatible (according to the tag) so it makes a great way to organize all your essential gear for your next flight.Premium camera bag or versatile backpack, the SlingShot 320AW is an all-round winner in my book.

$REVIEW.: Usually many people place their router in their office, but in most cases this limits wi-fi range since to does not provide adequate coverage to the entire home, especially when working with multi-floor environments.  In my case I used this mount to place my Time Capsule above on the second story of my home against the wall of my stairwell to the first floor.  This allows me to get good coverage throughout my entire home without the need for a range extender.  In addition, installation is clean and simple (it provides the necessary screws and template to properly install) and looks great too.  Simple item that will work wonders for your wi-fi!

A few notes:1. Although many Windows computers will automatically download the drivers for this tuner, those drivers will often be out of date. Be sure to download the latest drivers from the Hauppauge website. (If you're using Windows Media Center, it'll hang while trying to find signals if you're using an outdated driver.)2. If you have a computer with Windows Media Center, you won't need the software that comes with this tuner; Windows Media Center automatically detected the card and TV signals (after I updated the drivers), and it's an intuitive, robust program that works like a charm.3. The antenna that comes with this tuner will only suffice if you live in a metropolitan area where all of the broadcast signals generate within a 10-mile radius; the rest of us will need a heftier antenna. The Mohu Leaf is a good option, although I use the ChannelMaster DB8 since many of our local broadcasts generate from 30+ miles away.4. I don't know if the included remote will work with Windows Media Center, but I use theLogitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad. It's inexpensive, lightweight, small, easy to use, and has a wireless range of 33 feet.With all of that said, this is a good product if you've ditched cable but still want to be able to record your favorite programs. And for the record, my computer is connected to a 720 HDTV via a VGA cable and male-to-male stereo cable. The picture isn't as good as when the coax was plugged directly into the TV, but it's still quite good. If you have the option of connecting your computer and TV via HDMI, the picture should be excellent.

$REVIEW.: Got this as a stocking stuffer for my teen (17) boys who have an interest in computers and programming.  They have been very busy wiring and programming projects since they received them.  They are sure to learn a great deal from making projects with these.  I'm hoping they will prime their interest to pursue more electronics and programming knowledge in the future.

$REVIEW.: The printer is great, makes beautiful pictures, and is so easy to use I gave one to my mother to use for the few pics she takes during the year. The question is, where do you find Ink Cassettes for this thing. I'm finding that to be a problem. Check that first and if you have Ink by this thing in a flash it works great.

$REVIEW.: Ok the price is right but its no harmony remote at all. You can't simply go from watch tv to watch DVD as you have to first turn it all off then turn on play dvd. Also inputs are not correct 100 percent of the time.  Harmony you can easily go from one activity to another so Id say save the money and get even the Monster remote with Omni link it has Harmony software and hardware a bit dated design but it works...

E-mail tech support said call telephone tech support. Telephone tech support is American, not outsourced--hurray. Telephone tech support then said "If your printer is not on the supported printer list I can't assist you, you're on your own".  Canon claims to have a Silex print server that supports all Canon PIXMA printers--we'll see.  Follow up: the Silex print server works as promised - took several calls to effective(American)tech support but it works.This printer / print server problem is disgusting; they sell hundreds of thousands of products, should have accurate, reliable, up to date info on compatibility.

$review_text.: I bought this to help my see the keys better.  Some of the colors (Fully configurable) work better than others, but that maybe due to my vision also.The programmable G1-G18 keys are great for just about any command conceivable.  Plus there's three different memory settings, which is great for a keyboard with multiple users, so they may their own G1-G18 key setups.  Or like me, 3 different aspects of computing (Web / Media / Desktop-explorer).The display is limited to what programs Logitech has decided to support (&amp; program authors including code for the KB to access).I find it misses a keystroke about once every two or three sentences. Not sure why, I'm not a speed typist by far. The keys are mostly silent, and require a near full depression to register.* Power button - (turns on/off  lighting) is nice. Although the KB defaults to ON after reboots.* Volume wheel - REALLY sensitive!* Mute key - easier than using the task bar volume control.* Media keys - Play/Pause, Stop, Next &amp; Previous. Again, easier.Overall, I like it for my specific use. As for gaming? I can see where others have complained (especially about missing keystrokes).

 It will also accept SD cards up to 64 GB which is very convenient, especially if it is used for different purposes (personal, business) or by different people


 This also reduces the amount of time spent re-transferring the same files.The apps work okay but I prefer to transfer the file and then use the native video playback software on the portable devices
 The Android app is available on Amazon here:SanDisk Connect Wireless Media Drive App.This drive is especially handy for traveling

$review_text.: Great sound and Nice looking and small footprint. It's not apparent from the picture but the speakers are separate and can be placed apart. I'd give it five stars but the mp3 player doesn't retain it's memory. Every time that I turn it on I have to hit the shuffle button twice. That alone is not enough to bring it down a star but it also neither displays artist nor song on the LED panel, just track 666 or whichever song is playing.The USB hub works great and I put all my songs on a 16 GB flash drive.I really do enjoy this stereo... it sure can fill up the house with great sounding rock and roll!

I'm a TV addict and have had cable or satellite TV for as long as I can remember

I wanted to put a TV in the guest room though, and this one was just going to pick up OTA


I wasn't going to pay for another tuner box for a room we just don't use.I hadn't seen any OTA HD yet, but I had heard that it was better than I'm getting with DirecTV, plus I was excited to hear that my neighbors were picking up 15 channels.I live about 30 miles from the main towers
the ABC channel here is in the Hi-VHF band

The TV is on the 2nd floor, there is just plastic siding on the house, and I'm not down in a valley, so I had high hopes that I could get away with an indoor antenna

$review_text.: This product works well for its intended purpose, but you really have to think about if this is the right solution for your needs before purchasing such an expensive product
 Chances are if you are considering a product at this price, you've already thought of the "how am I going to control my source components?" question, or it doesn't apply to you because you'll be using this unit in the same room as your components
 Yes, it sends PERFECT quality HD video wirelessly without dropouts or interference
 But if you are planning on using this product to send A/V wirelessly from one room to another, think about how you are going to control your components first.If your source components and the TV (or other target device) are in the same room, no problem
 If your components will be in another room, you won't be able to control them unless they use BlueTooth (like the PS3) or you have an IR repeater/blaster.That being said, the product is impressive

 I do not notice any difference between the quality at the source or the target when sending the signal wirelessly with this product


 I have this unit connected to my Onkyo A/V unit in my living room and using an HDMI splitter, I have the output connected to both this product and my TV


 The receiver part of this product is attached to my TV in another room

 This allows me to play PS3 games and watch Blu-Ray movies in this second room which I couldn't do without this product (props to SONY for their BlueTooth remote and controllers)
 The only thing I can't do is change channels or anything else on my DirecTV DVR since the remote is IR and I don't have anything to blast the signal from the second room to the receiver yet.This unit comes with two HDMI inputs and two component inputs


 I don't understand why they even bother with the two component inputs
 Anyone looking at this technology and willing to spend some bucks on it most likely isn't using component A/V anymore


 Maybe ONE component input would be ok, but TWO?  I haven't tried the component output on this
 I'd imagine the signal received is identical to the output like it is on the HDMI side.This is a great product if it fits your needs

 If everything will be in the same room, and you just want to avoid the sight of wires or running wires through the wall, then you can't go wrong

 If your components are in a separate room, just make sure you have a way to control them before thinking about a product like this.

$review_text.: I really like these

 The original foam ear cushions that came with my Plantronics headset tore and generally wore down within a year or so


 I've been using these leatherette cushions for a few months, and I can say they're showing no signs of wear at all
 They're perfectly comfortable, they look pretty cool, and I think they'll last years
 For 8 bucks, something that does what it's supposed to do for years gets 5 stars.

$review_text.: I filled the backpack with a camera body, 4 lenses, and a flash

 There was still room for a small lens.Pros:Comfortable, good layout, a lot of versatility.Cons:On the first day of carrying it the seam started to pull out at the top of the straps then later at the top of the second pocket

 This was on the first day of a 10 day vacation so I had to be extra careful the rest of the trip to make sure it would not come completely undone.

$review_text.: The set up was a breeze and so far no problems.  I say so far because I intend to use this in a new desk which hasn't arrived yet.  The CPU will be hidden away and I'm wondering if I will have to have the sensor out on the desk top or not.  I hope not but if so, it's small and the cord that plugs it into the USB port is a decent length so it wouldn't be a big issue. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  Worth every penny.  Logitech can't go wrong in my book.

$REVIEW.: The first thing I want to say is that the difference in quality you get out of this cam is very evident depending on what IM program you use.  I used Yahoo for a while with family and we were all about ready to toss the thing in the garbage.  However, since Logitech recommends MSN messenger we thought we'd give it a shot.  Huge difference.  The images were more clear, the sound was better and there were fewer "freezes".However, it was still hardly outstanding and you must be prepared to spend quite a bit of time with your family and friends tweaking the distance of the cam from their face, the sound levels, the volume on their speakers, etc.  And if they change any of that the next time you videoconference you'll need to start over.  This thing is NOT plug and play for most people.Face tracking is utterly useless.  I don't know what miracle people are using to get it to work but for me all it does is make the cam jump all over the place.  If you're impossibly frustrated with it try switching to MSN Messenger, go through the sound setup, see if that does the trick, if not then move the cam closer to your face and then turn down the volume on your speakers.

This works like a charm, with no problems.The adapter has an extension cable that makes it easy to use on a desktop computer so I can put the unit in the best position for wireless signal.  Also, you only have to reach behind the computer once to install the extension cable for the adapter, and can keep it in a handy spot if you'd like to unplug it and take it along for a laptop, etc.  I was unable to install it on my desktop PC, as there is no Windows 8 support included on the CD, and none of the website at this time.  I would expect that to change, as the driver selection on the website was reasonably comprehensive, but check before purchasing if this is a critical item for you.To manage the wireless connections, I tried both Windows built-in support for wireless devices, and the included utility.  I still prefer Windows' built-in support, but the included utility worked fine and was easy enough to use for most people.You will get the best experience if you also have a router that supports dual-band wireless, though it will work fine with older units that have only single band (the vast majority of routers/WAPs in use today fall into this category).This would get 5 stars if it supported Windows 8.

$REVIEW.: works.  plays dvds without any issue.  like that I can use for netflix, hulu plus and amazon prime so that I can have one box doing everything.  have a roku box that I did use. problem is my tv has only 2 hdmi ports and one is used by the satellite receiver which leaves just one port left. with this player I do not need an external switch box or do the old cable swap to have everything.

The shoulder strap has no padding
It is entirely too large for my SONY SLT-A65VM, and defeats the whole idea of a holster (travel light) camera bag

The bottom partition with velcro attachments seems useless for an SLR equipped with a zoom lens

I thought one of the reviewers wrote that a point and shoot camera was stored in the space, completely hidden in the bottom of the holster

I cannot imagine this to be of very much interest to the general holster consumer
Unfortunately, it had to go back


The Ape Case ACPRO650 is a perfect match for me and it is of equal quality for less cost!

The keyboard worked fine, the mouse worked, but turned off or went into some kind of sleep mode after about 3 to 5 seconds. The mouse didn't stop working, it just went into a sleep type mode and you would have to scroll the wheel or click a button to get the mouse to move on screen. This was not just a operating system problem as I tested it in a protected mode program and it happened inside that program as well. This kept happening after a reboot, though no reboot was needed. Checked online for software for it as none came with it, nothing found. Checked manufacturers website, no drivers needed or supplied through support page.The keyboard and mouse worked, just not like any other wireless mouse I have owned. I personally would never buy this product again. If your current wireless mouse performs this way, it might be just what you're looking for, as the keyboard and mouse look and feel great.

$REVIEW.: I have Garmin 660 and 765T GPS devices.  I had purchased a genuine Garmin case for the Nuvi 660 unit, but the Nuvi 765T was always just tossed in the center console compartment in my car when not in use.  Wanting something to protect the 765T, I decided to give the AmazonBasics Portable GPS carrying case a try.  It arrived in Amazon's famous "Frustration Free Packaging," which provided proper protection for shipping yet was extremely easy to open.  The Amazon case is soft and flexible, with durable elastic on each side, allowing the case to expand for different GPS models.  My Garmin Nuvi 765T slid into the case with little effort, although pulling the device back out took a little more work.  The fit was snug at first, but after using the case for a couple of weeks the case loosened its grip just enough to allow easy retrieval of the GPS unit.  But it is still plenty snug enough to prevent the GPS from falling out of the case accidentally.The inside of the case has a soft padding, which prevents scratching of the LCD display screen and also offers a decent amount of protection against bumps and short drops.  Because my Nuvi 765T GPS device has a slider type on/off switch on the top of the device, I find it necessary to slide the switch in the lock position before inserting into the case.  This isn't a problem with the case, but rather an unavoidable issue with the design of the GPS as well.  I have the same problem with the Garmin case, if I slide my 765T in it.  My Nuvi 660 has a push button type on/off switch, which isn't affected by sliding the unit in and out of the case.I am extremely pleased with this AmazonBasics GPS carrying case.  It is soft, well padded, looks stylish, and provides the right amount of protection for my GPS investment.  While it's not genuine leather, it looks like it is, and it is soft and supple enough that I am sure it will stand up to many years of use and abuse.  I definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a protective case for their GPS.  Please remember, this case has exterior dimensions of 4.92 x 3.07 x 0.78 inches, and was designed specifically for Garmin Nuvi series GPS devices, although I'm sure a few other manufacturer's GPS devices could fit in this case as well.  The case is inexpensive but is made of quality materials.  It is definitely a great, cheaper alternative to buying a Garmin branded case.  I actually find the Amazon case to be better than the Garmin case, but that is just my opinion.
$review_summary.: Excellent GPS Case For The Money

$review_text.: I'm crying uncle on this one, friends. The delay/echo problem that surfaced in Windows Vista is far worse with Windows 7. Also, according to the DirectX diagnostic program, their drivers are not signed. No wonder they're messing with everything else on the sound card.If you want to use this device strictly to listen to music through your digital entertainment center's speakers using the optical digital connection, you will be quite pleased. However, don't expect Dolby 5.1. This device does not provide Dolby technology.If, however, you want to listen through the earphone output on the device, you will hear all sorts of pops and cracks.Also if you want to use the device to record music on your computer hard drive and need to listen to the monitor, the monitor switch is hidden in the device volume panel (it is a recent software upgrade), in the Mixer function window. There is a small box to the right of the field that says Mic-in/Line-in. Click that box. However, you will notice a horrible delay between what you say and what you hear back through the monitor. This is an absolutely unacceptable engineering flaw.I've communicated with Creative about the problem, and their attitude is "so sad, too bad, get a refund."To summarize, this is great for simply listening to music through your stereo. It is horrible for listening through headphones or when using the microphone/line-in monitor.

Having a long history of success with Logitech products, I went straight to Amazon and searched for &amp;#34;Logitech keyboard mac&amp;#34; and after browsing results I went with this one. I ran into one correctable problem and one nuisance that I'll simply have to live with...Pros:-All of the keys work perfectly, and the layout is great for someone who's used to using Windows.-No battery-changing to worry about-Little flip-down legs let you tilt the rear up at an angle-Quiet buttons-Setup takes five seconds*Cons:-The surface (other than the keys) is glossy/shiny and displays fingerprints and dust magnificently. I'm guessing they went with this to avoid having to use two different surface materials (the solar panels are necessarily transparent).-The surface is _also_ very &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; and wiping dust off with the included microfiber cloth resulted in scuff/scratch marks... from the cloth, not the dust.-The Fn key is in an odd place IF you're used to the placement on a regular Mac keyboard--I personally like it this way.-Construction seems a but cheap--there is a bulge at the top to the left of the Logitech logo; because of the shiny surface, this sticks out like a sore thumb.*The function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) on a Mac are, by default, used for things like screen brightness, sound volume, and playback controls. To use them as function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) you have to hold down the Fn key. OSX offers an option to switch this behavior so that the function keys are function keys, and to use the other system controls (volume, brightness, etc.) you have to hold down the Fn key. As one accustomed to Windows, I turned this option on. Unfortunately, the Logitech solar keyboard does not honor this setting, and you are left with the default behavior regardless of what you set in System Preferences. Logitech's website has a Control Center program available that remedies this--and only this. Since the program does nothing else specific to this product, I can only conclude that this was an afterthought bugfix. While it's not a huge deal, I do like to install as few extra little programs as possible.Overall, I like the keyboard. It's comfortable and works well, but I think it could have been executed a lot better. If Logitech were to release a version with a matte surface, I would sell this thing and buy the new one in a heartbeat. The Fn key issue is minor and fixable. I have a great distaste, however, for glossy devices (especially in black), and the fact that I have scuffmarks after two days of ownership really does irritate me.

$review_text.: Anyone who agrees that today's gadgets are likely to become obsolete in 2-3 years and therefore not subject to a lot of wear and tear before they get replaced by the 'next generation' may agree that an iPad creen protector isn't exactly a 'must have' accessory. Especially when the protected 'touch screen' is touched mostly with by fingers or generally soft objects.I was able to verify the claim that the cover will protect the screen from scratches. On the other hand, the claim that placing this on top of iPad's screen 'improves clarity' is clearly inaccurate. Placing an extra layer on top of the original screen can only reduce clarity even so slightly and it simply can't improve it. I can't express an opinion concerning the 'glare reduction' claim because I didn't have a sunny day to verify it during my testing. My subjective impression was that the iPad was slightly less responsive to touch while the screen was on, especially when using a stylus.This screen protector is delivered as kit, complete with instructions, a soft cloth for prepping the iPad's screen prior to applying the protector, the protector itself delivered in a pristine state between its own 2 protective layers and a little squeegee used to push any bubbles on the side. It is possible to install this and only have a few bubbles but doing it well is a learned skill and, at this price, it would have been nice if a 'practice' item came with the package.Considering that I personally dispute the need of any screen protector for an iPad, the difficult to justify (high) price, the imperfect outcome (bubbles) of my one attempt at installation and my subjective impression that the screen was slightly less responsive to touch post-installation, the fair rating for this product should be '3 stars'. I am not going to keep it on my iPad but I'm not going to have any screen protectors on mine. On the other hand, I respect the fact that some may want some protection for their gadget and, for anyone who needs one, this specific product is probably 'Okay' even though a little on the expensive side. Mitigating the high price is the Amazon-backed one-year warranty and my personal experience is that Amazon is very serious when it comes to honoring their commitments to customer satisfaction.

I am very satisfied with the case and will definitely recommend it to my family and friends who are all turning to iPads and Apple products.  Right after I received the case I decided I wanted a keyboard case and I ordered that as well.  I plan to use this case when I visit my family and won't be doing any typing.

$review_text.: Been using this for about 6 or 7 months with no problems. I work in IT, and as soon as I heard that there was a monthly equipment rental fee for the Comcast modem, I thought &amp;#34;...Why? How is it any different from any other modem?&amp;#34; When I asked Comcast if I could just buy my own, they said no. I looked online and saw a lot of people did though. I ordered this one, figuring I could return it if they truly wouldn't let me use it. I hooked it up and called them, told them I bought my own, and they activated everything on their side for me. Later on, I found a page on their website that lists compatible modems. So, moral of this story, if someone from Comcast says you can't get your own modem... they're wrong. Do it anyhow and save some cash. It seems like they 100% allow it, but just don't like to admit it at first. After all, they make a lot more money if you rent the equipment from them.

$REVIEW.: I got this camera to remotely monitor my condo.  I have an app for my iPhone/iPad that allows me to log in and check anytime of day.  Plus the  camera is setup to turn on when motion is detected and send a series of email pictures to me.  It's a nice feature but BEWARE since the camera has a tendency to false alarm when light levels change.  Despite sensitivity adjustments in the software I have yet to be able to resolve this issue.  It's a common complaint on the Foscam support forum.

$REVIEW.: I travel often to Europe, and in the past have always had hard time finding a proper power converter to help me use my electronic devices over there. However, I've finally figured out two things: 1. All those cheap power converters that you come across really don't work. A true power converter would be too bulky and too heavy to carry around, especially on a plane. 2. Most of the modern electronic devices don't need power/voltage conversion. They work perfectly well with both the US and European voltages. So what you really need is a plug adapter.This Satechi adapter seems to work reasonably well. It can adapt to the plugs and devices from the US, UK, Europe, and Australia. In that respect it's pretty universal. It also has a USB charger plug, which is an additional bonus since we are increasingly reliant on all of our small USB-charging devices.The adapter is very well designed and built. It seems sturdy enough to withstand repeated handling and vicissitudes of international travel. It is fairly compact, and its cubic shape makes it very easy to store.The most distinguishing feature of this adapter is, of course, the fact that it houses a fully functioning WiFi router. The router enables you to connect to an Ethernet cable and convert the wired Internet connection to a wireless one. This is particularly convenient when you are traveling and don't have an access to a readily available wireless networking. The router is easy to setup and use, even for people with limited networking skills. It is still a very powerful and highly customizable router, and it offers a wide variety of networking functionality. It can, for instance, be used to setup a private ad-hoc intranet, which may come in handy when privacy concerns are important for a small working group. I also wish that it enabled a networked storage access, something that could in principle be easy to setup with the available USB port. This feature would probably of use to power users, but could also be utilized as a family media server.Overall, this is a very thoughtfully designed voltage adapter/travel router that could really be of use to frequent international travelers.

$review_text.: I'm nonplussed at reviews mentioning how it's being used as a full-time connector for a SATA or IDE drive


 It's clearly not aimed at that market at all

 This is a kit designed for rescue/ recovery operations of someone else's HDD

 Case in point: me.I wrecked the partition table of my primary work HDD


 All in-situ attempts failed, so I brought the laptop home, mounted the HDD to my SATA cable kit, and ran the excellent TestDisk tool from Christophe Grenier
 My partition table recovered, I wrote it to disk and bright the HDD back into the laptop
 I'm back up and writing this from the work laptop now (don't say anything).I would never look at this complex jumble of wires and adapters and think "well, I'll just hook it up and let it go for a few years"


 No, sorry, incorrect application, despite the instruction manual showing you how to do it
 This is a stripped-down kit designed to travel with your rescue ops laptop when making a house call, like to Grandma's PC

 I find it's easier to run virus scanning, defrag, etc when the HDD is controlled by my known-good laptop.I withheld a fifth star because it's a complex mess of wires
 I don't know how one could make it look elegant and preserve its functionality, but whoever can do it merits the fifth star

 Wholly recommended product for rescue operations.-Fred

While my LCD does have the monitor input I felt more inclined to use the HDMI from the laptop, after all, why not use the HD set as intended?Since the laptop is mostly used in our living room, where our home theater is, I needed a cable not too long so 6.5 feet was perfect, I do not need to be right in front of the TV and I don't have the cable all across the room.Video and audio quality is great and since I started using these I have had no issues whatsoever (I once owned a Sony HDMI cable that gave a me a 'Video Input not recognized' error message from time to time, I switched it to an Amazon Basics cable and problem solved!)The frustration free box contains a pair of 6.5 feet cables

 For the price and quality, you can't go wrong with these!

Also, I work as a photographer for a local newspaper and we constantly use high-end Canon SLRs and G series compact canons. Let me tell you that the quality of this little guy (the first Elph I've had) is impressive. Actually, I would say this is on top with the "G" and SLR series picture quality, if you know how to make a few adjustments.I've had the powershot SD1000 for 6 months, I've taken it to a few trips, parties, work events, and I carry it in my pocket every day. The features it has (like face detection, digital macro, time-lapse video, color accent, etc.), for the price, are fantastic. However, the best thing this camera offers, IMHO, is a quick operation. It takes VERY FAST pictures, and if you set the color to vivid, with a proper white balance, the images you get will surprise you. I recently had a trip to Cancun and took the camera with me. When I came back I wrote an article about my trip for the Sunday Magazine at my newspaper, and they used my pictures, as they looked very professional.If you're a casual photographer, you can't beat this price,  get it now.There's ONE thing, however, I still hope canon introduces in the future: a more practical video mode format.I'm not saying the video quality is bad. Actually it is the best I've seen in ultra-compacts. The thing is, that after having owned a Pentax Optio s5z for a year (before this one), which used good quality divx compression (much smaller files), I found myself taking many videos without worrying about remaining space in the memory card. The "video thing" started growing a lot on me. However, canon uses almost no compression in the AVI files and so, for each 1GB of memory, you can only record 8 minutes of video (2GB = only 16 minutes!).About the image stabilization: I don't miss it. If your hands are not very shaky and you use the proper ISO, you can overcome this. However, if you're using 1600 ISO, you will see "grains" unless you keep the picture to "web sharing" size. It's normal with compact cameras.My next camera will be (if it's still on sale) the SD750, because I recently found it has a 3 inch LCD, and I don't really use the viewfinder in SD1000 (a personal choice).Bottom line: for vacations, every day use, social snapshots, pets, the occasional "artistic" inspiration, fantastic response and pro-quality images at a very affordable price, you can't go wrong with this camera.

$review_text.: I received this in the mail yesterday and am typing this review on it.  Overall it's a great little addition to your Nexus 7-great for productivity. The case is sturdy and the stand is an added bonus. The keyboard is removable-held by Velcro very firmly-so you can use it independent of the case. Of course it adds bulk to your tablet, the thickness of a small hardcover book. For some people the keys might be too small, but since I've been doing most of my writing on an Asus eee PC,I like the size. Speaking of keyboard, some buttons like the apostrophe are in a different place and the Caps Lock tends to stick if every so often, but I chalk that up to being brand new.  My only issue thus far is that there were no instructions inside of the box, which means spending a little extra time in setting it up. Be very careful to select English as the language default or you will end up typing your essays in Serbo-Croatian. Overall, it's worth the purchase.
$review_summary.: Great keyboard but a bit of a learning curve

 I have used dozens and there are few that I like (1 or 2)

 This is the best zoom lens I have used, IMHO it is heads, shoulders and knees above the performance of the 18-70mm kit lens (which I used for about 1 month) and the 18-200mm vr (which I rented for a weekend and thought it was garbage, it could have been a bad copy I suppose)
 Speaking of sharpness..


I have the 50 f/1.4 and the Tamron macro 90mm f/2.8 which I consider to be my 2 sharpest lenses

 If you are as picky as I am about softness then this lens is for you
 It is as sharp as the fixed fifty (1.4) and the macro and both of those are known for being RAZOR sharp
 I typically shot between 30 and 55mm with this lens and I am rarely disappointed

 I suggest renting it for a weekend, that is what I did, shot a few hundred exposures, if you do not like it, don't buy it

 Consequently if you get mugged while holding this lens it could be used to defend yourself, it is ridiculously well built and solid

In my opinion this is the best zoom lens for the nikon D series, good choice for those who are picky about sharpness.

$REVIEW.: I got this quickly and for the money I spent on it, it has GREAT sound. I bought something similar a while back (but I do not think it was Bluetooth capable) that sounds like garbage compared to this. The blue light is VERY bright, so this might not be good for bedtime music, but I am very happy with it overall. I had a little trouble figuring out how to get it paired with my phone, but I am sure that had more to do with my lack of technical expertise than it had to do with the system in any way. The only thing that would make it even better for me would be if it came with a remote control... I have it in a small cubicle shelf, so it is a little inconvenient to access the buttons on top since the shelf is only about an inch and a half above it. Anyway, I like it a lot... will be getting one for my kitchen and probably another for my living room (and just throw that other one I have in the trash where it belongs!)

I had to install the software several times because for some reason the computer would not take it


Later I found that you have to disable your firewall to allow Eye-Fi access to your modem not your computer


What bugged me the most is that you have to login to their website and type your IP address AND password for your internet modem

I am always very cautious about internet security and these issues did not reassured me at all.I installed the software just to be able to see how it worked and it runs almost at the same speed it would as if I just inserted the card on the computer.The difference is that I had to disclose IP address and password and disable my firewall every time I use Eye Fi
To me, it is not worth it to sacrifice security for "convenience"Unistalling it is a pain because the uninstall function does not run as smoothly as it should so I had to basically erase ALL the files manually.If you are not a "computer geek" I would not recommend this product.

Wanted something to augment my 19 inch HPw1907 monitor that still works great even though it is over six years old. It works great but, but not my eyes and was getting tired of squinting. After searching all over for a monitor that would help out I found the ASUS VE258Q. It has made a world of difference on my reading since I can really expand the size of the screen. The speakers or so-so but they do work. I've been using the monitor for several months now and have no dead pixels or any other problems with the monitor it self, the documentation could have been a little clearer in set up but since I didn't break anything I think that it went okay. I didn't find there is any stand wobble as other reviewers have stated, so maybe trying to put it together more than once really did help.

My existing stereo system has two large BIC speakers for the normal Left-Right service connected to to a Yamaha 5.1 receiver. I connected this center channel speaker connected to the Yamaha and now I send my TV's audio to Yamaha receiver. My main reason was to get better clarity in the dialog. This center channel speaker seems to have provided that. Am happy wit it.

$review_text.: I am a guy who is really into gadgets and gizmos


 I also appreciate quality electronics and good value

 This receiver is probably the best value you will find although I wish it had a few more HDMI inputs


 Everything else does exactly as it says it does.OK, here is a comment of 0.1% of people out there, the amp in this - while adequate - has trouble producing midrange and there is the slightest interference from the transformer


 You will have to really be an audiophile to notice any of this - and then probably only with fairly high end speakers

 I only noticed it with headphones.Oh, and don't forget that this thing is HUGE


 Make sure to measure twice, order once.

$REVIEW.: I got this TV for under $300 as a Black Friday deal and am very pleased with it. Color looks very good using the vivid setting. The base is a little wobbly given the size of the TV. I would not put this TV within reach of small children without some type of additional mounting (probably the case for any flat screen TV this size).
$review_summary.: Excellent TV for the price.

$review_text.: This is my second RavPower product and I am quite impressed with the quality and performance of their items. The first item I got from them was a 5500mAH powerbank (a portable battery to charge phones/ipod etc) which is still going strong.This battery (HP12B-RB, 12 Cells, 10.8v) was used and tested in a HP DV4-2145dx laptop. The original battery for this laptop wasn't holding a charge, pretty much dead. I got the 12-Cell battery which is quite larger then the 6 cell, but also lasts longer which is great for me for those long flights.  The 12-Cell battery raises the back of the laptop off the surface which has the added benefit for increased air flow and tilting the keyboard up.  I like the keyboard being tilted up on the laptop and pretty much prefer it that way now.  The angle is similar to a desktop keyboard with the clips put down. It is in the middle price range for replacement batteries but looks to be a quality product. The packaging is attractive and the battery came in a electrostatic bag.Below is a timetable just to give an indication of how long the battery lasted and an indication of how long it took to charge.  The laptop was being used in full performance/operation when these times were taken, if the laptop was off the battery no doubt would have charged faster. Note: the instructions state that it will take 5 full charging cycles (charge/drain) before reaching full capacity, my test was done after 1 charge cycle.6:10  full charge6:38  84% charged6:49  77% charged7:05  69% charged7:56  46% charged8:32  32% charged8:43  29% charged9:15  8% charged, system goes into hibernation mode9:36  15% recharged9:46  20% recharged10:20 35% recharged10:42 46% rechargedAfter the first use the battery lasted roughly 3 hours.  Once the battery has reached full capacity I expect the battery to last even longer.Specifications:Model: HP12B-RBCondition: Brand NewCell Type: Samsung Li-ion 12-CellVoltage: 10.8vCapacity: 8800 mAH 95wWeight: 3 pounds12-Month manufacture warranty.One quirk: Make sure when you put the battery in that it clicks into place or else when you move your laptop the battery may loose contact and your machine will shutdown if you don't have the AC adapter plugged in.  This happened to me twice until I figured out that the battery needs to click in place.  It was somewhat difficult to get the battery to click in place but it does.But overall this is a great product, and I would highly recommend it.I was provided a free sample by the distributor for testing and evaluation to write a fair and honest review.Note: Read the instructions prior to use. The instructions state to charge overnight before first using.  The battery I received was 42% charged.RavPower Webpage with information on compatible part numbers and laptops, which is really a lot.[...]I was provided a free sample by the distributor for testing and evaluation to write a fair and honest review.

The contrast is much better than the Thunderbolt display but more than anything it is an anti-glare display compared to the extremely high gloss than the Thunderbolt display


In addition the dell monitor adjust to more angles and heights.While this monitor may not be as sleek at the Apple monitor, it is more affordable and offers more features with better tech specs
I would highly recommend this monitor.The only regret I have is that I didn't purchase the 30in version of this monitor!

$review_text.: The other reviews tell you pretty much everything good you need to know about this system.  I used to own the Onkyo SKS-HT500 speaker system with a TX-SR600 receiver, and this system outdoes that one by a mile, on sound alone, let alone the new HDMI connectivity, THX rating, and numerous other state-of-the-art features.  Great sound and fairly easy setup, especially with the Audyssey calibration system.  I'd say this is the best sound you can buy for less than $1,000.Two caveats:-- The box is huge and heavy (136 lbs.) and will very likely arrive quite beat up at your door. Mine was so bad it was scary, but Amazon is offering to replace the subwoofer which got damaged. Luckily everything was else okay.-- Get your own speaker wiring, at least 16 gauge for the surrounds and 14 for the front/mains. The included speaker wires are barely suitable for your bedside alarm clock speaker.

This does the job by connecting wirelessly through bluetooth with the PC and it also has a port to use an AUX cable with non bluetooth devices.Pros:-Great sound quality-Versatile connectivity-Light weight-Comes with a case and all needed cables-True to battery duration (10-12 hours)-Great price!Cons:-On and off switch works weirdly, you have to press it for 4 secs to turn off and 5 secs if you want to turn it on and pair it via bluetooth so turning it off is kind of hard, you have to be very exact!-Volume buttons don't work when connected via AUX port, you will have to adjust the volume on the device it's connected to.-It leaks a lot of sound so it will definitely disturb others around you (this can be a deal breaker to those who use these sort of headphones in public, not my case though, however do consider that sound leak proof headphones will be very expensive).Highly recommended product for it's quality, versatility and price!

 Instrument separation is present, and of course the nuances that can't be heard on less expensive earbuds are there, as well
 I have been sampling earbuds and headphones all summer to present
 In no particular order:  BD T770, Ath-M50, sure se 215, rockit sounds R-50, Bose...ugh...lol, Ultrasone Pro 550, 750, UE 700, thinksound ms-1, ClarityOne, Sony EX310, Ath MKII??...All of these I have either returned, exchanged, or sold

 I honestly could not tell the difference between the Ultrasone PRO 550 or 750...over the ear headphones are a different review...lol...My latest over the ear that I am waiting to hear is the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 Limited Edition


 Hopefull the last pair of over the ear I will have to buy...I listen to vast arrays of music, from: Alterbridge, Esperanza Spalding, Harry Connick Jr., Seal, Metallica, Joe Pass, Coltrane, Sade, Maxwell, Motley Crue, Faure, Ravel, Miles...yada yada...Quality sonic reproduction is what I was searching for...and these babies pleasantly deliver.

I'm on Amazon right now to purchase a Roku 3. The remote on this is horrible. The laggy UI is downright painful. It's just cheap. Cheap crap. If you're in the market for one of these, a very frivolous commodity, then you have the money to purchase something that's not, flat out, just a piece of cheap crap. Get a Roku 3 or some other device that may cost more, but won't make you want to toss the remote through your TV.And since I didn't discuss it in my initial review, the android app that controls the device as a remote? Worse than the actual device. I'm talking 15 second lag. If you're lucky.Initial Review:The UI on this thing is atrocious. I say that not because I'm a snob that thinks all UIs should look alike, but because it's horribly, horribly, horribly laggy. You hit a directional to move the cursor and there's always between a 1sec-3sec delay. Going from the home screen to being inside of a stream on Netflix takes upwards of 2 minutes between the loading screens -- and no, I'm not including the buffering.Now, that said, it does exactly what I want it to do. It acts as a near perfect XBMC extender (through DLNA). It plays everything from my DivX to my mkv just fine. Once Netflix is loaded, it streams it in perfect HD as well. (Which is why the lag is so frustrating, if it has the power to decode 1080p files, it can handle a simple UI -- it's just sloppy, unmotivated coding causing the lag).So four stars. It's cheap. Cheaper than a Chromecast, and can do much more (DLNA). If you're looking for a very low cost device to act as an extender to your main XBMC HTPC, this will do exactly what you're looking for. Just go in to it knowing the UI is a nightmare.

Keyboard works great and I use it with my Coby Kyros.  Great product for the price.Updated review - December 25,2011 - I purchased a second case as a gift but received one that did not have a spring-loaded top clip as the first one did.  The first one was sold be Lan Zheng and the second one came from JK Games.  Now I see the shipper is DigitalMic.  I bought it for my Coby MID7022 7' Tablet.  The MID7022 is approximately 4 3/4" wide so you have to make sure the top clip is spring-loaded if you are buying it for this tablet.

I used to have dropped connections about once a week..  with the new one they are almost daily.  The distance is actually shorter than the old as well.  Just goes to show that the latest isn't always the best.  I have tried different settings and have only noticed moderate improvement.

The only thing about this is that the it should of came with a MCX male to Female connector, and a MCX male to BNC adapter.  The software that came with it via download has FM broadcasts in stereo and some RDS decoding.  I am planning on buying a better antenna and maybe a low gain preamp for this.  The remote control that came with it is useless, ended up in the junk drawer until there is a way to use it for some TV app in the future.  This is my first device that take MCX connectors, now I have to start collecting those and you cannot simply find them at a R. Shack.  Sometimes the dongle runs hot, but not so bad and the software needs updating. I will plan on getting another one soon.  I just want to remind you that this device is not compatible with Windows 8.

$review_text.: So that you don't misunderstand the title of this review, this thing weighs a ton. But if you are bringing your huge flat screen TV, and your surround system, and assorted AV equipment with you overseas, add this to the list.Note: it gets warm. But it's a power transformer, so that's to be expected. I just don't leave it on because I don't want to waste the electricity that is keeping it warm. We have all of our AV equipment plugged into power strips (also purchased in the US) which are plugged into the front of this unit. Whenever we want an AV experience, we flip the blue switch and give the systems a minute to boot up. When we're done, we flip the whole setup off via the blue switch on the transformer. Since the transformer also has a 220V plug on the face, we hook up our locally purchased 220V AV equipment to it as well.It does hum a little sometime, but it isn't a bother. After daily use for more than 1 year, we have no complaints.Note 2: This transformer will NOT work well with AC motors. No transformer will. It transforms the voltage to 120V, but it does not change the frequency. A motor designed for 60Hz will not be happy on 50Hz (everywhere outside of the US &amp; Canada).

Wifi networks are notoriously tricky, so your mileage may vary (as the reviews here show)


I suspect at least half the time it's user error


So if you have trouble, do make sure you're doing everything right before blaming D-Link's extender

I found it easy to use, and if you're technically competent, you should too.

$review_text.: Overall I liked this mount. It has a cool gripping mechanism for the phone (GPS), but this was also it's downfall. It's hard to explain, but see those arms that look like backwards capital "D"'s? Those slide apart (creating backward capital "C"'s) to accommodate and support longer devices. The way they slide is on small plastic rails. Well, somehow one of the thin plastic rails broke and I was unable to repair. Too thin and brittle? Did I bump in to it? I don't know. But now, I have a broken GPS/phone mount.The design is cool, useful and very adaptable but the longevity and durability is in question for me. One additional plus; it looks like they've updated the mounting bracket. The old one (mine) was a cumbersome 2 piece "hook here, screw there" type of design. Functional, adaptable to different sizes but a pain in the neck as well as having loose parts that are easy to misplace. The new design in the picture looks very user friendly as long as it's steady and sturdy.

But the truck has a small alternator and when combining powering the lights for a trailer, AC in the summer, radio, and the laptop, the voltage on the battery started to drop (I was taking more juice out than putting into the battery).When I turn the inverter off and use this instead, that problem goes away. While a laptop doesn't use much power, once you pay for the DC to AC conversion in an inverter and then the AC to DC conversion in the standard laptop adapter, it takes almost double from the car battery as it uses in the actual laptop. I only needed a few 10's of watts to solve the problem and this did it. And for far less than putting LED lights into the trailer would have been.

$review_text.: I've had these headphones for 2 years now and just had to write a review and give credit to Sony for these great headphones. I stopped by the local BB store and compared the new popular brands Bose and Beats. I plugged in my iPhone to each of the latest headphones that this store had available and the Sony's are way better. Not only offering sound cancelling but with the added power from the battery, the bass is amazing, rich deep sound, great mids and highs. Excellent for all music, just a really great all around headphone set. Again, I've had these for two years, and I noticed Sony had released a new version of these also with battery power, I wasn't able to test those. If they are as comfertable and great sounding as this model, they should be a great set.

I like that it can charge the phone but I prefer to use the Bluetooth technology so I can control it from a distance. For essentially the same price, you can get the Jambox by Jawbone -- which is Bluetooth compatible with any nearly device (Android, iPhone, Blackberry, PC, Mac, etc.) There is no future-proofing w/this purchase unless you will be strictly Android person for the rest of your life. The Jambox is smaller and yet provides better sound. It's also sure to have better re-sale value if you decide to pick a different option in the future. This product operates as it should, it just isn't the best way to spend your money on this type of product (unless you really love Androids and really must have your phone be able to charge while jamming out to your music).

$review_text.: This is one of the most advanced routers in the market for home users

Lots of features, easy to set up (~20min) and a very cool texture on top of it
The antennas have several positions if you want to put those


As far as i can see a great coverage area, having in mind that i live in a 2 story house with concrete walls

Runs warmer than most of the routers but in an acceptable range, nothing serious
One thing to keep in mind is the brightness of the different led's (lan1,2,3,4, etc) they are very very bright,1.2 meters above the ground they lit up the ceiling pretty good (~2.8 meters total)
Some features are not working correctly but i just need to sit down and figure those out myself (i.e
IP reservation on the DHCP)

I will give it 5 stars because 20 minutes can't be taken to get the full view of the capabilities of this puppy


I will update if anything goes wrong

Oh, BTW some users was reporting the ongoing "There's a new firmware update" message and nothing happened, seems to be fixed cause I did look for new firmware and now it says "Your firmware is up-to-date".

$REVIEW.: Overall a great product.  I don't think it is worth more than $150.  No where does bose metion that these headphones need to be powered in order for them to work; I actually thaught I had a defective product, then I decided to call Bose to enquire.  Also turns out you cannot control wether to on/off the noise cancelling while listening to music--noise cancelling is alway on.Pros:-Comfortable on the ears and head (but not sitting around the neck).-NIce looking brown color goes well with me brown/gold Samsung galaxy Tablet.-Best noise cancelling i've experienced-Good goundCons:-Not able to control Android devices-Not able to daisy chain with another headphone or device-Cannot play music unless the noise cancelling is on and unless the headphones have power.--THIS IS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINMENT FOR ME

$review_text.: I was looking to upgrade from my old 32" Samsung high definition television to a 40" smart tv (since I'm thinking cutting the cord and going to streaming and antenna).  My nephew has a 55" Samsung smart tv, and it is so sharp that it sometimes makes movies looks as though they were shot on a daytime television set-- sort of a shabby lighting setup. My old Samsung was a lower definition, and never looked like that, so I thought it might be a condition of the 1080 resolution.I am a fan of Samsung, but I saw this Vizio on display at Costco for a bit less than Amazon, so I thought I'd take a chance on it-- since I bought it locally it would be easy to take back if I didn't like it.No worries about that, however, I love this set.  I used most of the settings suggested by another reviewer here, and the result is a beautiful, sharp picture with wonderful tones.  The setup for my internet connection took maybe 30 seconds, and pairing it with the 32" Vizio soundbar (bought at Amazon) gives me great sound with no changing inputs when I switch from satellite, to streaming to DVD.Some people have complained about the remote, but mine seems to be very responsive.A very nice television that will likely suit me for many years to come.

$review_text.: Bought this Blu-ray drive for use on my late-2012 27" iMac


With the appropriate software (MacGo Blu-Ray Player, DVDFab Blu-ray Copy) it works well for playing and backing-up Blu-ray discs


The drive without a hitch whether connected directly to the iMac or to myPlugable 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub


My iMac reads Blu-ray discs at around 9MB/s so the USB 3.0 interface really isn't necessary
DVD read speeds consistently a bit slower than with myAmazonBasics USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer, which is a bit disappointing given the price of this drive
The brushed aluminum case is a good, but not perfect, match for most Mac hardware


All in all a decent, if slightly expensive, drive.

In the end it just didn't work with our Macs, not to mention isn't supported. So I found out which router Apple sells and figured that was a safe bet!

$review_text.: I held off purchasing these screen protectors due to some of the reviews indicating that they were either very, very difficult to apply, did not offer any glare protection, or did not help hide finger prints.  When I finally did order it and install it, I was relieved to find that none of that is actually the case.I'm sure some people had some issues applying them, and perhaps there are others out there that might hide glare and fingerprints a little better than this one, but in general for the price, they are very good screen protectors.I was able to apply it without much problem in about 20 minutes - something I was really concerned about when reading previous reviews.  The glare from the screen is considerably reduced, and fingerprints are not nearly as noticable - although they are still present to some minor degree.I really like the fact that they are a totally static-contact product - no adhesives or liquids to deal with at all.  In my experiences, liquids and electonics don't mix so asking me to spray something onto a tablets screen to apply a screen protector is just an accident waiting to happen.I also watched the installation video that they ask you to on YouTube, but found the procedure they demonstrate to be somewhat cumbersome when trying to align the camera and light sensor holes at the top of the screen.  My solution to this was to lift up the left and right sides of the protector as I aligned the two holes at the top center of the screen.  Once I had those two holes lined up, I layed the center of the protector on the screen and slowly let each "wing" of the protector down onto the surface of the screen.  This not only made it easier to align the holes, but also produced almost NO bubbles.  I only had to push out 3 or 4 near the edges and that was it.Hope this helps anyone who is trying to decide what to do about keep thier ASUS TF300T screen in pristine condition.

$review_text.: What can I say? This tunes in digital TV. I like that it has options for changing aspect ratios depending on the programming and what kind of TV it's connected to.My biggest problem is that it will turn itself off after a couple of hours of not touching it. Say you're leaving it on the same channel all day (for sports or something). Be sure to adjust the volume or change the channel once in a while. If not, it'll turn itself off after a few hours. It takes a while, but it's still a quirky little issue.

$REVIEW.: I've bought this set a while ago so I thought I would leave my views on how it held up.First, unfortunately I lost the AC adapter so I can't say much about it.The Zune cable itself worked but it never set correctly into the base port, I could even insert it upside down if I'm not careful


 I'd recommend using it with a Zune dock so any risk of damage is reduced.The car adapter was extremely flimsy and fell apart after being left in the glove box when not used.Overall if you need a quick fix and a spare Zune cable it's not to bad in that regard

 But I also say spend the extra money and get something that is built better.

$REVIEW.: Way too much static.  At first I thought it might work for pod casts of radio shows.  And, it sorta was ok but every time the car turns a corner or you drive near a wire or do anything, the static gets too strong to hear anything.  It definitely won't work for music.Reception is better if you hold device in hand but that isn't very practical for driving.  I tried setting it in cup holder, on passenger seat, hung from rear view mirror, sitting on dash board - all of these resting places caused more static.  I tried a variety of station settings - it's the same on all of them.

$REVIEW.: I travel about 40 weeks a year, so this adapter saves me from needing a separate keyboard and mouse to drive remote presentations from the Surface Pro, as well as allows me to have a nice Bluetooth remote in the evening by attaching the Surface Pro to the hotel TV. Works perfectly, small and light, plus it recharges using the same charger as my phone, so nothing extra to carry in the bag.
$review_summary.: This is a great travel adapter

$REVIEW.: This is by far the most beautiful and functional TV I have ever owned. Set up was as simple as assembling the stand (5 minutes) and getting an extra hand to help me lift the TV onto the stand and then onto the entertainment center. After agonizing over the ST50, I ultimately ended up choosing the GT50 for the 4th HDMI slot and the built-in THX modes. I did not want the hassle of calibrating and I had read other reviews that stated the THX modes were great out of the box, and indeed they are. It was wonderful to be able to use it immediately without the hassle of calibration. Built-in wifi is also a huge plus and was a cinch to set up. It is in the same room as my router and is pulling 35-38mbps which is plenty for HD streaming. Aside from a few tweaks in the settings, such as removing the channels I don't utilize and removing the ads, I was ready to go.I am utilizing all 4 of the HDMI slots for my PS3, Xbox 360, Apple TV and a spare cable for my HD laptop for PC gaming on the big screen. Everything I have thrown at this TV has looked spectacular. I have been re-watching some of my favorite wildlife documentaries just to experience them in the beautiful HD. Panasonic provides a nifty little adapter for your composite cables as well so that's where the Wii ended up. All of the games and movies we have tried look simply gorgeous. My kiddo is a big Cars fan so we've logged quite a few hours playing Cars 2 on the Xbox and watching Cars and Cars 2 in Blu-Ray and with the 2D-&gt;3D conversion on, I feel like I can reach out and touch McQueen!I had an older Panasonic which was one of the first Smart TVs and didn't have as many useful features as this one. I love the built-in Netflix with the dedicated Netflix button on the remote. It's true that every single device I have plugged into the TV is capable of Netflix as well, but it's so much more convenient to just push the Netflix button and be there with one remote. The Hulu channel is also great and I was very happy to see Amazon Instant Video here as well. Having the ability to rent movies right from the remote is fantastic. You truly get a full suite of video entertainment built right in with the streaming movies, TV shows and movie rentals at your finger tips. Set up for these channels was a breeze and we were up and running with all of them in minutes.Among the other channels is a Skype channel (can't say I'd use this often, if ever) and an internet browser. I glanced right past the browser initially, automatically assuming it would be plagued by the same issues as all other add-on device browsers, namely slow, clunky interface and lack of flash support. This browser, however, has a speedy interface and working flash!! It's not as good as just plugging in my laptop and using my mouse and keyboard to navigate, but for those times when I just want to check something without having to get up and plug in the laptop, this browser is pretty decent. I was able to load up Hulu.com and start streaming The Office in seconds. I read the top review here on Amazon, however, and noted that he claimed he had to download the browser and enter his credit card info. I did not have to do any of this. When I first went to the Internet section (where the browser and other apps are located) it prompted me to update the software, which I did. It took a few minutes and that was it. I was able to use the browser (which was already present without a separate download) and was not prompted to enter any info of any kind. Just wanted to clear that up!There is a game/app channel as well, and aside from a brief peek inside, I haven't bothered with it. I am already too invested in other gaming systems to dump more money into another gaming ecosystem. It's nice for those who just want a few casual games, but I would rather buy something off Xbox Marketplace or Steam with my hard-earned money. That's just my opinion! All the other popular apps you would get with the Roku or Apple TV are available for download from the Viera connect store as well. Pandora, Tune In, Ustream and YouTube are my favorites, but I noticed a number of sports and specialty TV apps as well, including anime and adult content (which thankfully can be disabled via settings). Most of these require a paid subscription, but there was one really cute app designed specifically for kids that has a fairly good-sized library of completely kid-appropriate cartoons and is totally free. You won't find Spongebob or anything Disney here as these all appear to be "indie" style and many are only a few minutes long. However, not all of them were unknown as we found several that Nick Jr. airs between shows, such as Danny &amp; Daddy. The interface is super simple so my kiddo really enjoys exploring this channel for new things to watch. All the apps we've used so far are superb. We are planning for an upcoming trip to Disneyland so one of my son's favorite activities is watching videos of the rides on YouTube. The app is really easy to navigate and I really like the auto-play feature that automatically goes to the next related video. The Netflix app also has this feature if you are watching a video from a series. Nifty!I was skeptical about the 2D-&gt;3D conversion upon ordering and assumed I'd probably not use it, opting to only view true 3D content. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually works quite well. Clearly it's not going to be as impressive as content that was designed for 3D, but for being an on-the-fly conversion, it's actually pretty great. Everything we have watched or played with the 3D conversion has been really nice. Via our Apple TV, we're even able to play our iOS games in 3D!! My 7-year-old absolutely loves this, as do I. Switching between 2D and 3D is as simple as pushing a button on the remote. Awesomely simple.My only complaint regarding the 3D is that I can't figure out how to activate it when viewing Panasonic's built-in apps, such as Netflix or Hulu. When you are "in" one of these apps, it disables the 3D button on the remote. I can only imagine that this was by design, but I can't figure out why. So if we want to watch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, etc, in 3D, we have to utilize our Apple TV which will then let me activate the 3D button on the remote once again. If I'm missing something, please let me know! I can't access the 3D button or the Viera tools button when in one of the native apps. Not a huge deal for me as I have access to these via my other devices, but for someone hoping to watch Netflix in 3D right out of the box, they may be disappointed.It's also worth mentioning that the TV does not come with 3D glasses. I realize that the Samsung TVs do, but the Samsung glasses are also far cheaper than the Panasonic glasses, so it's not really an issue for me. I picked up a pair of the Samsung 3D glasses and they work flawlessly with the GT50. They synced up immediately upon turning them on, no set up required. Very nice. However, if you are planning to use the 3D more than a couple hours a week, I recommend picking up the Panasonic glasses for one reason: batteries! The Samsungs have about a 6 hour battery life, after which you have to throw down </review_text><review_summary>Just purchased.</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="AU95SR6CO9YXO"><latest_review_date>04/10/2013</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B008AJNF78</product_id><review_date>04/10/2013</review_date><review_helpful /><review_text /><review_summary>Very nice product</review_summary></review></reviews></user><user id="AU9X0FKGKPC1K"><latest_review_date>10/09/2011</latest_review_date><reviews><review><product_id>B002WE0QN8</product_id><review_date>10/09/2011</review_date><review_helpful>[0, 0]</review_helpful><review_text>I have been searching for a replacement to theMicrosoft Trackball Explorer.  The Explorer is probably one of the most ergonomic, comfortable, and precise trackballs I have ever used.  I have 2 left that are functional, but they are approaching 8 years old.My search had brought me through Logitech's trackballs, but they were not as comfortable and lacked the scrollwheel.I was turned on to the Kensington Expert Mouse this last year and found it to be very precise, easy to use, but not as comfortable or natural feeling.I overlooked this 'mouse' for a year.  Recently I looked again.  I watched a video.  It dawned on me:  This could be what I was looking for!For the last couple days I have been using it non-stop.  For gaming, I missed having additional buttons to program.  This one only has two.  (This cost the product 1 star).  But, playing on it for nearly 2 hours with no pain had me sold.It is ergonomic.  Your hand rests naturally on top of the mouse and the buttons are at your thumb and ring or pinky finger.  The scroll-wheel is responsive and I do think it needs a little tweaking in the settings and some getting used to, but it is much more comfortable than the ribbed scroll-wheel of the Expert Mouse (which I am also fond of).I would like to see the return of theMicrosoft Trackball Explorer-- it is still champion.  But for travel and as a plausible alternative, this one is the only thing that has come close.  I am pleased with this purchase.Regards.

I wanted a 1.4X teleconverter to recover some of the loss of effective lens length that comes from making that jump.Since the two lenses I wanted to use with this TC the most are Sigma lenses (the 70-200 f2.8 EX DG OS HSM and the 150-500 f5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM), I first purchased the Sigma 1.4X EX APO DG teleconverter.  I had that TC for two days, and found the loss of sharpness to be unacceptable.  Since I'd bought that from Amazon, I was able to return it.On one of my flickr groups, I came across a few stunning images taken with the same 150-500 lens as I have, and this Kenko 1.4x TX.  I decided to give it a try, and so I bought it (again, from Amazon).So far, I've taken about 400 pictures with this TC, using not only my two Sigma lenses, but also my Canon 70-300 f4-5.6L.  And a couple hundred more using my wife's 60D.  So far, I'm very impressed at how well it works.  I'm sure that there probably IS some loss of IQ, but it's very small.  Much much less than the Sigma TC, and certainly not enough to tell until you start looking at 100% crops.  I got a picture of one of my beagles with my big Sigma lens and this TC, and it's probably the sharpest picture I've taken to date with that lens.  And while the Sigma TC didn't work on the Canon 70-300L lens, this Kenko didn't have any problems at all.Autofocus works OK with this TC, both on my 5Kmkiii and on my wife's 60D.  It does focus a little slower than without the TC, and sometimes it hunts a bit in low light...but you knew that going in!  My camera correctly adds an f-stop, and correctly reports the total effective FL (lens length X 1.4) in the exif data.Bottom line, I'm happy with this purchase. If I lost this TC, I'd buy another one.

$review_text.: Great case i use daily. Originally bought for my 558's which fit perfectly, i use this case primarily for my ATH's. The case is attached to my backpack so it bumps into things on a regular basis but my headphones are still in flawless condition and work perfectly.Only complaint that i have which is stopping this from being a 5-star item is the clip/lanyard that attach the case. It is a little longer than i would like to be, which makes the case swing back and forth more than i would like. Wish the length was adjustable or just shorter.

$REVIEW.: When I got my D100, I bought it used, and it came with this equivalent hand grip

 When I upgraded to a D200, I initially thought I didn't need this handgrip..


but wow did I miss it.First, if you take portrait-oriented photos at all, this is a hand grip with a control dial and shutter button exactly where you expect them

 You can take portrait orientation without sticking your arm out like a chicken wing.Second, with the D200, even with the cool battery management capabilities, battery life seems shorter than the similar setup did on the D100..


probably because of the bigger screen, faster sustained picture rate, etc

 The ability to stick two batteries in this really extends battery life.Those two things combined make the investment in the D200 so much more useful.On the D100 version of this, the handset adds a small microphone so you can annotate individual photos

 I used that feature exactly once, when I wanted to figure out how it worked


 This handset does noe include that feature, and I'm thankful - this handset is *much* more inexpensive than the D100 handset, probably because of smart design decisions like this
 The courage to cut a feature rather than add more useless stuff is refreshing - and what earned this the last start to push it into the '5 star' category.

$review_text.: I am ABSOLUTELY thrilled I purchased them. They were professionally installed to my factory NAV stereo system. They produce "live-studio" quality sound with clear separation between notes and a powerful response. You will hear all of the instruments. It impressed the pros to ask me where to get them. And, they told me about the top-grade materials/workmanship used in manufacturing. There's zero distortion when I crank-up the volume (3/4 max) before my ears bleed. I will need a remote and some serious distance to go to max volume.  I am not an audiophile but I have paid the money for (Denon, Yamaha, Onkyo, Nakamichi, Bose, B&amp;O;, etc.) stereo equipment. It's truly high-end audio-quality sound without spending all that money.Like others, I heard the cautious "don't buy MB Quart because" they were bought by Maxxsonics and are (1). No longer a German company (2). The quality is not good. But FIRST, No one that said this to me ever heard or installed them. SECOND, Maxxsonics is an American (California) company and if I am going to take a chance on quality then why not American? THIRD, the speakers are still manufactured in Germany. FOURTH, the Premium-Series is 3 levels above their "factory-installed" speaker replacement recommendation.Lastly, I called Maxxsonics because I got a lot of conflicting installation advice. Also, I needed one extra measurement that I could not find anywhere else. Not only did they answer the phone but they quickly pulled the speaker out of the box to get the information I needed. We talked about configurations and sorted thru all the stuff I was told. They knew I was buying the speakers from someone else and they sent a follow-up email afterwards. That translates to excellent customer service.Here's my setup: a Jeep Liberty (2002-2006) with factory-installed NAV stereo system. The factory amps found in the front doors were connected to the MBs. The speaker openings are larger than 6.5 inches so adaptive brackets were used. The tweeters fit perfectly. Forget what anyone says - you do not have to buy shallow-mount speakers for the rear doors. The factory-speakers we pulled out were full-sized. The MB crossovers have 4 settings (0, -1, -3 and -5). I chose zero because I usually set treble at +2. To test the speakers I burned a cd with songs that had lots of transitions, deep-deep bass lows and really-high end notes. The MBs played it like I was sitting in front of a live band. There's no other stereo equipment in my car. Anybody can spend $5k and get great sound - but do it for less than $500.I think one reviewer said it best " BUY THEM."

$REVIEW.: I like it very much the only thing I think was wrong with it is that it seamed to b put together the wrong way.  The sleeves seemed to b in upside down cuz the case has a pouch in it, and the way it was assembled the pouch would have been useless.  It is easy enough to fix cuz the sleeves r snapped in with clips in sections.  If u decide 2 get this item and change them around b very carefull cuz they can pull out of the fabric.

$REVIEW.: I bought this a few weeks ago to record several series that are broadcast in digital

 I didn't want to spend tons on DVR service, renting equipment and all that just to be able to record now and then.Setup was easy but the supplied antenna would not do the trick on most of the channels

 After connecting to our attic antenna, all stations come in 100%.I'm using mine in a relatively new quad-core running Vista 64


 Media center recognizes the device and I'm able to record, play, watch live tv and burn DVD's through Media Center


 I found the Pinnacle software to have a few sound issues so I only use MC

 Recorded Rudolph in HD and burned a DVD last night for my daughter and the quality was amazing.The only issue I have is the FM Radio is not recognized in Media Center and has issues in the Pinnacle software


 I only subtracted a star since I bought this for over-the-air Digital Broadcasts and I'll never use the FM option.

$REVIEW.: The Cosmos leather case is an ideal cover for the unusually-shaped Sony NEX5 digital camera, offering thorough protection when the camera is not in use. It need not be removed when downloading images onto a computer, as the uncovered yet unobtrusive cable slot permits transfer without removing the memory card and thus the entire case. The reduced price offered by Amazon for this well-designed and high-quality leather case makes it a real bargain.

$review_text.: I was looking for a higher quality in-the-ear headphone solution, and a set of Sennheiser CX-680-i's were on sale over at Newegg. They were competitively priced (or so I thought, until I came over to Amazon). A couple of my co-workers are big fans of Sennheiser, so I thought I'd give 'em a try. I found the CX-880-I's to be in my price range, read the customer reviews, and hit the 'ol "TAKE MY MONEY" button.A week later, they arrived, along with my Creative X-Fi Go! USB Sound card. Set everything up, and played with the three different seal options that came with the headphones. I found the medium set to be perfect (I must be average, ear-wise). As other reviewers stated, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT FIT! I then proceeded to play multiple songs of differing qualities, and noticed a low-level whine. Turning up Windows 7's bit-rate, and using the "Optimize for Headphone" options available fixed this.The good stuff:They sound amazing, with terrific clarity. You will hear things in your songs that you didn't know were there, if you were using crap-quality headphones before.The construction is sturdy, with no quality defects or imperfections that I can notice so far. The placement of all features seems to be in an optimal position.The packaging came with a considerately optional clip for mounting these bad boys to your shirt or shorts or whatever your thing is.The bad:Not really anything to mention here, other than I was inattentive and got the i-Device compatible version, even though I own no Apple products.

$REVIEW.: This is a replacement for the factory battery that comes with a panasonic FX35. It must also be compatible with other models (check on the amazon or panasonic website). I use it as an extra battery - it's just the same as the one that comes with the camera and it's a cheap accessory for the extra convenience. What else to say about a simple battery? Well... it's cheap - so go for the genuine panasonic instead of messing around with a generic battery that might work as well if lucky... or just be really bad.

$REVIEW.: Extremely quiet even when the fan speed is high (compared to the 4870X2 it replaced it is silent).  Easy installation and it handles all the games I own without breaking a sweat.  I will give it a true test when Skyrim comes down in price, but Diablo III doesn't even cause it to elevate settings and Arkham City at maximum with full DX11 effects only stuttered once in 3 hours.  My first Nvidia card and I am impressed.The OC software is simple to use and monitoring temps and fan speed is easy to do.  A little spendy, but warranty protection for an OC'd card and the superior cooling are worth it.  When the price drops I may likely add a second card in SLI mode.

Two issues I have noticed so far:1) the gel material tends to attract dust and dirt particles and pet hair.  It's not a big deal but it is noticeable.2) the edges tend to bow outward and don't fit flush across the front face of the iPad.  Others have noticed this on other colors so I don't think it matters which color you buy -- you'll have the same issue with all of them.So, the good news is that it looks like it will protect the iPad but as mentioned above, there are a couple of design issues to consider.  I should mention that this is a replacement for a plastic cover that I was previously using.  The plastic cover developed stress cracks and eventually failed which is why I went with the more flexible gel material.  So, the tradeoff is basically a little more dirt and hair and a slightly ill fitting cover for a pretty decent amount of protection.

$REVIEW.: Just got this 1050 watt PSU from Corsair to replace a burned out Thermaltake 1200 watt PSU.Great investment even though it's not the top of the line, it is still a rock solid reliable, cool and quiet PSU for overclocking, gaming, or general PC use.Cool is the main adjective that comes to mind. Air expelled from the rear of the unit feels about like room temperature. Also very quiet,my case fans are all I hear.Update:After about a month and a half of use, my original 1050 quit. it took out an SSD with it too i fear. RMAed it to Corsair and received a replacement that is still running. Hopefully this one lasts, so far so good. At this point i would have to take off 1 star of my rating due to the initial failure.Still a decent PSU though, and warrantied for 7 years.

$REVIEW.: The Good: The buttons work in an intuitive way
The cost is reasonable, compared to typically way overpriced official MS XBOX productsThe Bad: The IR signal is pathetically weak

 I am sitting approximately 8 feet from the XBOX, and unless it pointed at exactly the correct angle it does not work


For me this is next to useless, it is a near total FAIL

 I would only buy this if sit close to the XBOX with a somewhat perpendicular angle, or if you intend to use an IR Repeater etc


 I'll give it to my wife, who's XBOX is only 6 feet away from her couch.UPDATE: The problem seems to be that the IR Signal does not like to go through glass
 If the front of the XBOX is not covered by glass, and is fairly well exposed, it seems to work OK

 The signal seems a little weak, and the buttons sporadically don't seem to respond unless you press them very hard and deliberately


 Updated rating to 3-Stars.

 I needed to be able to stream HD video from my NAS upstairs to my living room downstairs and didn't want to run network cable.After getting it setup, I could only get about 24 Mbps throughput out of these and my house is only 2700 sq ft


 That's not even 5% of the ADVERTISED SPEED!  A complete joke

 I couldn't get a single HD video stream to go over these.Needless to say, I returned this joke of a toy and decided to convert my telephone lines into gigabit LAN since my house phone lines where wired with CAT5e and I don't have telephone service
 Even though I am only using a 100 Mbps switch, I can still handle 2 full HD 1080p video streams on just 100 Mbps

 This further illustrates the point that this junk hardware cannot even live up to a 16 year old network technology rated at 1/5 of it's own advertised speed.

$review_text.: Used this for an iPod Touch 4th Generation.PROS- Fairly solid construction- Like that it's all self-contained, no extra cables or anything else needed- Seems to have pretty decent volume- Good bracket system feels solid, easy to use, and holds the iPod really wellCONS- May NOT charge your iPod Touch 4th Generation; it keeps popping up a message that my device isn't supported for charging- 3 out of 5 for reliable signal/sound quality; I've had better- Flex system a good idea, but they don't seem to have done much practical testing; from a front mounted lighter socket in my '04 Subaru there isn't really a very handy position for it. It's not completely unmanageable, but any position is a bit awkwardOVERALLI've tried three different car kits for my iPod. The other two had better signal/reception quality, but their construction gave out within a matter of weeks or months. I'd like to have something that makes access and control much easier. The awkward of this one definitely is a safety issue since it requires too much attention to engage with it to do anything. All the cons considered, though, I've been more satisfied with this one than any of the other products I tried.

And cheap


Good value.

$review_text.: Incredibly useful little devices. I keep on adding one of these to pretty much every Amazon order -- I'm always finding something that "needs" surge protection, and at this low price, it's pretty much a no-brainer. The Surgecube was a little bigger than I expected it to be, but it is by no means bulky. The green lights, however, seem to be brighter than necessary to indicate that the device is functioning properly. It might be annoying out in the open in your bedroom, for example.The Amazon description says the Surgecube protect up to 885 Joules and 45,000 maximum spike amperage. The product packaging, however, indicates 1080 Joules and 72,000 amps... which I guess is some order of magnitude better? (Hey, I'm not an electrician.) That's also twice as many Joules than the similarTripp Lite SPIKECUBE. I guess you might not *need* this much protection, but if you're going to go, you might as well go big, right?The Surgecube is, unsurprisingly, made in China.

$REVIEW.: Didn't buy this at Amazon, but ended up returning 3 bad copies in a row before giving up.  The first had severe softness at 75mm.  The 2nd had severe BF at 28mm.  The 3rd had slight BF at 28mm and softness at 75mm.While testing I saw flashes of super sharpness (75mm on 2nd lens and 50mm on 3rd lens).  If Tamron could figure out what's wrong w/ their design so it can be more consistently manufactured, they'd have a real winner.I did wish the range were 24-70 instead of 28-75 though...the Sigma 24-70 uses a ridiculous 82mm filter (they should stop at 77mm or the filter prices get ridiculous).

$review_text.: I bought mine a little over a year ago.  It worked great then, and still does, but as always happens with electronics it has been out-classed by the current generation of video cards.  Still, if you want a decent card at a good price, this is it.One issue I had with this thing is installing it:  I had to use tin-snips and cut a section of my tower case in order to make it fit because it takes up TWO back slots even though it only uses one slot on the motherboard.Another issue that was easily fixed:  the wiring for the fans is long and loose, so it was getting caught in the fan blades and the thing would stop spinning and overheat.  So, I took the loose cables and taped them up out of the way against the inside of my tower case.  No more tangles.
$review_summary.: It was great when I bought it.

$REVIEW.: Installed on an Intel i7 2600K socket 1155 CPU.  The installation guide does not mention socket 1155 even though the sales literature lists 1155 compatibility.  Installation guide covers AMD AM2/AM3 and Intel sockets 1156, 1366, 775.  (Manufacturer's web site had same guide as received with the product so it provided no information on socket 1155 installation.)  Guessed that 1155 would be same as 1156 and this was a correct guess.Installation is actually easy but the lack of detail in the supplied guide can cause installation delays.  Step 1, prep of metal retention ring, provides horizontal clip orientation but not vertical orientation (refer to image on step 7 or 9 to get vertical orientation).  Step 2 (backplate prep) image shows socket information on 1 of 4 corners for mounting the tension clips.  If you use this orientation on each of the 4 corners, the backplate won't fit when you get to step 4.  The clip position for each corner is different.  The socket information for each corner is molded into the backplate in a small font and probably won't be seen until you realize the backplate doesn't fit.  In bright light with 20/20 vision, you can read the molded numbers and execute step 2 properly.  The remainder of the installation is sufficiently intuitive to execute properly with the minimal detail provided in the installation guide.Once installed, the performance is great.  System is OCed to 4.4 GHz.  Stock Intel cooling provided less than 5 minutes at 100% CPU utilization before the CPU temp exceeded 85 C.  This cooler keeps the temp below 70 C under all load conditions.  Using a BOINC project to achieve continuous 100% CPU utilization, CPU temp was typically 62-64 C at nominal GPU utilization.  Max temp was 67 C when both CPU and GPU were at 100% for an extended (&gt;1 hr) period.  Computer cooling problem solved!

Suffice it to say that I'd gladly spend 2-3 times as much for another Panasonic personal player with onboard speakers than have to settle on a JWin.  But unlike the other JWin I tried out (along with a GPX and Colby), this one plays even when it's moved and turned upside down. 4 stars is admittedly overly generous, but given the skip-and-stick action of other cheap models and the lack of competing product (an "ordinary" CD player with speakers in the cover), I'm determined to make myself like it.The pluses (from my perspective): 1. "Dedicated" CD player (no MP3's, compression ratio options, and other annoying complications).  2. It pops open and boots up your CD in a jiffy.  3. The onboard speakers allow for quick and efficient searching of the content of CDs and testing of their playability. 4. It's just loud enough for the user to hear it.  5. The 60-second memory makes the anti-shock system effective.The minuses: 1. The audacity or absurdity of the manufacturer to market this as a "stereo player" (the speakers are less than an inch apart!) and the marginal loudness of the speakers (the Panasonic's onboard speakers, though on a smaller surface, put out twice the volume). 2. The quickly tossed-in AM-FM radio (FM reception is totally absent without plugging in the headphones to serve as an antenna, though the tuning dial is too stiff to bother with even if the radio had decent reception).  3. Tiny, dark display (keep a penlight handy).  4. Teeny tiny buttons (pimples) for operating stop, go, pause, skip (the Panasonic's were twice the size despite the smaller size of the player).  5. The inclusion in the battery compartment of a little folded-up piece of paper with instructions telling the user to hang on to and employ an included, loose, tiny metal cap when using rechargeable batteries.As for the headphones, I simply tossed them--have too many from previous players as it is.  It does have one feature lacking on the Panasonic: a prominent yellow&amp;black; sticker on the back of the player helpfully advising the user to charge only rechargeable batteries, followed by the fragment--"May cause explosion."  Sounds exciting--just don't misplace that tiny metal cap.

$REVIEW.: I never could understand why they ship monitors and such with such short cables. I mean even a few more inches probablyIsn't going to break the company!Thanks to Amazon and the Cables Unlimited 10' DVI D I can now place my monitor anywhere on my desktop with no problem!I looked at the computer shop here in my town and the cables they sold were alot lighter and cheaper made. I don't knowif it helped getting a better quality cable but the price at Amazon was less then the shop was asking so I'm happy!So if like me your desk is made where the monitor has its own place and the cord is too short to put it there, you can find the answer at Amazon!

Window 7 recognized it immediately, and using my existing non-Hitachi backup software, it was reading and writing data without problems right away.PROS:-nice sleek appearance.-USB bus powered, so no external power adapter or cord.-small form factor; slightly larger and thicker than a smart phone.-Quiet operation.CONS:-Bundled backup software didn't work, and is equally dedicated to to selling Hitachi cloud storage services as it is to backing up your data.  Excruciating details are addressed separately below.After a short period of ownership, I can't address the long term reliability, but Hitachi drives enjoy a good reputation. This one has a two-year warranty, which is hard to find in these days when the industry standard is one year.Now, about that software, which is flawed enough to cost this drive a star...mostly for the hubris of Hitachi in considering this anything other than a beta release:Hitachi's backup utility ("Hitachi Backup"...the boys in marketing didn't waste much creative juice thinking of this name) was included on this drive. Many external hard drive vendors do the same thing;  I haven't found one worth keeping yet, and Hitachi has not changed my mind with theirs. Even worse than offering limited user options ("Automatic" and "Scheduled"...with the latter being selectable only in 15 minute increments, and no apparent manual/on-demand option) are these other two glaring faults:(1) after setting a backup time under the "Scheduled" option, the user interface backup status indicator switched from "ON" to "OFF"...and would not switch back. And it most certainly did NOT start copying any files when the designated time arrived. This was accompanied by a yellow warning sign indicating that backup was disabled. In the words of Tina Fey on "30 Rock": "what the what?" Apparently the software also has a "restore" function as an adjunct to "backup"...but of course, I couldn't try it without backed up data.-half of the backup user interface is devoted to upselling Hitachi cloud storage services. You get 3GB at no charge by registering; after that, you can buy upgrades at $49/year for 250GB. I didn't register to test this, but hope it works better than the local backup utility. You can register a domain name from many web hosts and get unlimited storage (or nearly so, depending on their terms of service) for about the same price. It's not a competitive price, and I'm not sure it would work given the issues with the software managing a local backup.Do yourself a favor: delete these files from the drive the first time you connect it, and stick with your current back-up method (or use the one bundled with your operating system...or just do a copy/paste when you get paranoid about data loss...any of these approaches will work better than this software).

$REVIEW.: This  splitter did not do what I needed


 Maybe it is my fault
 I should have ordered a HDMI switch I guess


 Wanted to be able to  run the TV or the Blu Ray Player
 You can not have both plugged into the splitter at the same time


 Neither one will work when both are plugged in

 I have a older TV that has only one HDMI receptacle and I thought that I could feed both  receiver for TV and Blu Ray Player into the splitter and then into the TV

 The splitter does not work that way


 Still will use the splitter because it gives me a better condition to get at the back of TV
 But must have only one cable plugged into it


 You plug in the cable from either the receiver or the Blu Ray Player depending on what you are watching and unplug the other.

$REVIEW.: I was planning to use this antenna as an upgrade from another Antennas Direct UHF antenna, the DB8:Antennas Direct DB8 Multidirectional HDTV AntennaAccording to the specs the 91XG should have had significantly better distance reception and be more directional
The UHF stations I wanted are all mounted on the John Hancock building in Chicago


The antenna was snapped together exactly as described in the instruction sheet
The balun was OK and reception was OK with the 91XG.I was surprised when in side by side swap-out tests the DB8 8-bay UHF got better reception and signal strength numbers at the receiver than the 91XG
Note that this was in an attic above the 2nd floor of a house with a pretty clear ~50 mile line of sight to Chicago

The antennas were on the other side of a 1920s wood frame with a solid brick veneer.I used the same cable (RG6U) feeding directly to the TV and the antennas took turns at the same spot in the attic aimed at the tower site
Not a perfect scientific test, but still reasonable
Since the antennas were planned to be installed on the roof in the spring the added wind load of the 91XG meant there was nothing it its favor.

The speed supported was superior to the router I was currently using so I began the quick installation to start up. I went though the standard quick start steps three times and it came up with an error each and every time. I eventually just went into my computer's network settings and did it my own way and it now works great. There was an improvement in the loading time for online games and videos, but that of course had partially to do with the fact that my old router did not support the speed that this one does. I would recommend this for someone to buy, but you might need to know enough about setting these up to not follow the directions and override it yourself.

$review_text.: Normally I purchase the Apple brand Matte Screen Protector in the Apple store near my home, but the price is pretty high and you only get two screen protectors instead of three. When I saw that Belkin offered an alternative I thought I'd give it a try because I normally am extremely pleased with their products. Unfortunately this simply didn't live up to my expectations.My major concerns:- Smudged easily- Lacked the touch sensitivity I'm used to- Needed to be replaced oftenAs I said, this didn't really live up to my expectations, but it does do the job when necessary. If you don't mind replacing your screen protector every month or so and would like to try something a little less expensive than "name brand" I'd say give it a try. You may just like it more than I did, but unfortunately my expectations were perhaps set a little too high.
$review_summary.: Okay for Matte Screen Protector, but Not the Best.

$review_text.: This is an very nice and compact telephoto lens, especially on DX bodies like the D300; nice and sharp even wide open and by f/4, performance is approaching world class. This lens produces sharp, high-contrast images on the D300 and bokeh is excellent, with a soft and pleasing out of focus area rendition.The lens starts to show it's age on full frame cameras however, including the D700 and especially with the D800.  Pixel level acuity is marginal on the 36MP sensor of the D800 and while downsampled images look great, the 180mm f/2.8D just can't keep up with the demands of the newer high resolution camera.  Purple fringing is on an extreme level with high contrast subjects and extends out from the edges of transition areas for 5-8 or more pixels.  I found this to be unacceptable and very distracting and therefore will no longer attempt to use the lens on the D800.  On the D700, the situation is better, though still not perfect as there is softness that never quite goes away outside the central image area, even when stopped down.Others have complained about the M/A focus mode switch, but in my opinion, the lens is a mechanical marvel considering the older design and lack of a built in focus motor. The lens is very solid and has a wonderful manual focus action - the best manual focus of any autofocus lens I own, with a very precise and positive action. Build quality is exceptionally high.  Autofocus is slower than a modern AF-S or shorter focal length AF-D lens, but totally acceptable for most shooting situations. Internal focus keeps the length consistent.Another great `feature' of this lens is its relatively small size and light weight. It is much less obtrusive (and sharper IMHO) than the 80-200 f/2.8 AF-D, making it a great high-quality carry-around telephoto. For perspective, it's about as long as the 18-200 DX VR (with hood attached) and so fits nicely in a medium sized bag.On the down side, it's a little expensive, but if you want to own a classic, and especially if you shoot a higher end DX Body (with the required built-in autofocus motor), this is it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the SC101 as a filestore for my friends lawfirm and set it up about a year ago. Boy was it the worst thing I ever did for his business. I remember the install being a rather unfriendly process. A few days ago his Admin calls me to say they are having some sync trouble, but the files are still there. So I go in yesterday and upgrade the firmware and PC software as per the instructions on [...] .The damn thing set the drive size to 0 MB and killed the partition. Tech support told me the device was defective and outside warranty even though just prior to upgrading the files were there. Now the law firm has lost all of its client files that were on there.Do yourself favor and dont get this thing. If you want to throw money away paypal it to me!

$review_text.: I bought a Pentax K-30 for my more rugged outdoor photography sessions.  I don't typically need a flash, so I leave the GPS unit attached all the time.  My camera still fits into my LowePro 100 Slingbag (with no extended camera battery attached).  HEre is a quick review of the O-GPS1COMPATIBILITYI use it on a Pentax K-30.  The K-30 does in fact support the Astrotracer feature on the GPS.  The GPS menu on the K-30 is easy to access and use.FORM FACTOR and AESTHETICSThe O-GPS1 has a fairly tight form factor.  It adds about 2" to the top of the camera.  It does take over your hot shoe and will block the built-in flash. The GPS unit itself is about 2"x2" square.  It looks great on the camera. And has not been getting in my way at all.FUNCTIONALITYAs I mentioned, the Astrotracer feature does indeed work on the K-30.  I have used this feature a couple of times and it has been great.  This feature allows you to manually focus on a celestial object (not planets, though) and the mirror will adjust so that the exposure follows the star, etc.  The main reason I bought the O=GPS1, though, is so that I can remember where in the world I took a shot.  The location comes over in the metadata and has worked with both Lightroom and Aperture without any hiccups.  The GPS on average has required a 3D satellite signal within about 90 seconds or less.  Location info has been very accurate.  You will need to recalibrate the GPS each time it dismounted (you do this by carefully turning the camera on each axis).  The metadata even indicates which direction you were facing when you took the shot.There is a built in compass as well as a trekking tool.  You could conceivably store the location of your car when you park if you are going for a photo shoot on a trail, but you would be better off with a dedicated GPS for that.  Still, it's an added feature and I'll take it!DURABILITYI haven't managed to drop the GPS (yet), but it has been subjected to dust, dew, wipe outs on the ski slope, and a sudden, brief downpour.  It will need to stand up to this and more based on my intended use of the K-30 its mounted on.  So far it has stood up to all of these tests, the biggest of which was my wipe out on the slopes where my camera and the GPS were totally covered in snow.RECOMMENDATIONReally, at this price point, I think the O-GPS1 is a great deal if you want location info included with your photos.  Accuracy and reception inside or in an urban area with tall buildings might be touchy, but if you're an outdoor shooter, the O-GPS1 is a great device.  And it seems to be a perfect match for the weather-sealed K-30.
$review_summary.: Works extremely well.  A definite value-add at this price.

$REVIEW.: This is the first time I have used a SSD on a personal system. When putting together my last upgrade for my computer, I was between getting one of these or getting 8 more gigs of RAM.I am so happy I chose the SSD.I did some research about SSDs and found that for its price, the Samsung EVO series was delivering quite an outstanding performance. I decided to give it a try and use it as my operating system drive, which obviously mean it is the drive which the computer uses to boot up.The difference from my old HDD is simply impressive. It takes but just a few seconds to have all my programs running. After the Windows logo, the screen goes from black to being completely populated by my 3 desktops (I am using 3 screens at the time) and all programs running in just a moment.I wished I could provide the difference in actual seconds, but it is simply impressive.I am extremely satisfied with this SSD and I am actually thinking on investing on another one for my most regular games and programs.I am sure I will never go back to a HDD for booting, it is just too big a difference.So, if you are like me, a person who is annoyed at having to wait for the computer to complete booting up, this is what you have been looking for.

$REVIEW.: These are nice little units.  Worked perfect for my use, wedding photography.  These units operate the flash in manual mode only, so don't expect ETTL functions with your flash, but for wedding photography they worked great, set the powers of my flashes (used 4 flash units, 4 receivers and the 1 transmitter.  They have great distance and would recommend them.  They have 10 channels so you can set your transmitter to what ever channel you have your flash set up to.  I used two channels and two flashes on each channel.  Worked great as I moved around and set the appropriate flash units for my shot.

$review_text.: I started to review this product and give it an awesome score based on what it does for a PC but Targus has also clearly stated that it works for a Mac as well. So my score is really an amalgamation of the two. This did not cool my Macbook Pro at all. It still ran hot. But I sort of knew that going in. Macs are notorious for it. But there is a solution. Latosta makes a great metal riser/notebook stand that works and I have been faithful to that product since the day I picked it up. It even angles the laptop, adjustable, to offer nice positioning for your hands while you type. And the best part is that it's less than 20 bucks. What bugged me most about Targus is that the fans just sit underneath the Mac doesn't have any openings so the air flow just becomes useless.On a PC this thing works great. My Toshiba constantly overheats and turns off, placing this underneath it saved me from murdering it. You can hear a clear hissing sound from the fans but it's not distracting. Luckily, I only needed one USB slot to power it, when I used to try it out the noise became a distraction then. The low hum turned into a whir that was annoying. And that was on top of the laptop's fans going.So there ya having, works great for PCs and sucks for Mac users.

$review_text.: I bought this to get me by until I can afford something better. Given some of the reviews here, I did not expect much. Nevertheless, I have 3 case fans in my PC.One of them is fairly quiet on it's own. It's one of those with a 3-position speed switch and it's very quiet on it's lowest setting.The other two fans are much noisier. I don't mind a little noise. It's really a tradeoff for good cooling, which is a must. But those fans were starting to wear me down. I bought this to tame them a bit.Worked better than I expected. I think there is a significant gap in the settings where you can turn the knobs and not much happens but the level of adjustment is adequate for my needs. My PC is much quieter now and the temps don't seem to have gone up much.Unfortunately, I kind of had to improvise on placing this in my case. It is made to fit a 3.5" drive bay. A fact I did not notice until after I'd placed the order and the item was already on it's way.All of my 3.5" bays are internal. This is not unusual. Most people only have 5.25" external slots so in order to mount this the way it is (apparently) meant to be designed, you'd need a 3.5 to 5.25 converter. I don't have one and buying one would cost more than this controller cost.Pros -1. Works pretty good. Actually reduces fan noise2. Cheap.3. If I go crazy, it won't be because my PC sounds like a vacuum cleanerCons -1. There's not a word of English on the box and there's no instructions. Though I guess it's not a big deal if you know what you're doing enough to order this to begin with.2. The only "extra" feature this thing has is also a con for many people. The LED lights on the front of it are bright and you can't turn them off. Since I'm actually putting this inside my case (where I will hopefully rarely have to have access to it) and I don't have any kind of windows or anything on my case, I guess I can live with it. If I ever do buy an adapter to put this in my 5.25" bay, I'll have to try and take it apart and kill the LEDs without killing the fan controller portion. Excessive light coming from my PC is almost as bad as excessive noise coming from my PC. Maybe worse.3. It's probably not really possible to get a fan controller with this kind of functionality without a lot of wires but if you like the inside of your case to be pretty, you will be doing some serious cable management to hide the mess of wires this thing creates. Personally, my case is just a black box with a power button and I don't care what it looks like inside so I'm just lucky.4. As cheap as it is, obviously, I kind of worry about reliability. I'd hate to think something might go wrong and I'd be sitting here thinking my fans were doing their job and they aren't even spinning. I'll obviously have to monitor the basic functionality for a few weeks before I trust it.Conclusion -If you like a quiet computer, buy a fan controller. If you can afford it (which you probably can't if you're considering this one), buy a better one than this one. NZXT appears to make some of the better ones.EDIT January 07 2014 - Since I wrote this review, I have not experienced any unforeseen issues with this product. It does what I expected it to do and since I put it inside my case where I can't see the lights, I forget it's even there. I have not adjusted the controls very often since I got them set where I wanted them. That might be a factor to consider if you buy this. If you adjust your fan speeds frequently, you might want to consider a higher quality product.

$REVIEW.: I tried connecting this cable to both my receiver and than straight to my TV, using my Iphone 4s and a Ipod 3 - No video.The audio came through and the screen on the apple devices indicated video was being sent out but no go. I had to break down and buy the expensive apple cable which did work.

The standard picture setting preset is near flawless when compared to calibration patterns and even standard def TV becomes tolerable when watching in the wide-fit picture mode.When using HDMI be sure to adjust the HDMI black level setting to avoid overly dark images but otherwise near perfect. The just-scan picture mode is great for high def sources like bluray, gaming or even HD broadcast; be sure to use game mode for gaming as this set introduces a lot of lag otherwise.The 120 frame auto-motion is fairly useless however and the TV looks its best when this feature is turned off. The one time it may have been useful, gaming, becomes a moot point since you can't have the auto motion on while in game mode. Bluray 1080p/24fps is awesome though and the 120 frames per second makes this possible so it is still worth it to have.The only real complaint I have is that the plastic bezel, the touch of color border around the edge of the screen, came with some factory defects in it; a noticeable dimple near the buttons and many many scratches that are clearly visible in some lighting situations. In direct sunlight the bezel also shows its transparency which can be distracting and make the TV look like a cheap plastic set.Overall though I don't have any regret in buying this set as it oozes quality from almost every aspect; little things like the blue filter and auto disabling of inputs that aren't powered on to make switching sources easier really give the impression that time was taken when designing the set. I just wish I could make it ignore the standard analog coax input because I will never, EVER use that. Period. This isn't a complaint against this TV though as EVERY HD TV I've used does this for some reason.Until new technology becomes mainstream, maybe OLED TVs, I can't see LCDs getting a whole lot better than this so buy with confidence.

$review_text.: Getting the right monitor is a balancing act. My own monitor is a 27 inch 2560x1440Apple Thunderbolt Displaywhich I love but know is not for everyone due to cost and Thunderbolt requirement. I also have a 27 inch 1920x1080HP 2711xwhich is cheap but has a poor picture and horrible viewing angles. In the middle, price wise, I bought this 24 inch 1920x1200 monitor for my wife, mainly because that is the maximum resolution supported by her 4 year old Mac Mini, and I have been pleased with the choice.At a higher resolution and smaller size than the 2711x, text is smooth and clear, while the IPS panel gives great viewing angles, and the colors have fine saturation without being cartoonlike.  It's comparable in picture quality and brightness to the more expensive Thunderbolt display and leaves the cheaper monitor in the dust.On the negative side, USB power management is too aggressive. I really don't want to power down my USB devices if I turn off the monitor. I ended up not using the built in USB hub, this contrasts with the Thunderbolt which has USB, FireWire, Ethernet, a camera, a microphone, Thunderbolt out, speakers, a MacBook charging cable, and a subwoofer, most of which I use daily.  So, this monitor is mainly about its excellent display and not accessories. I am happy it has a DisplayPort, in addition to DVI, so there is some future proofing there.The buttons and display LEDs are attractive, easy to find, and the configuration menu is easy to navigate.In general, if you want a real computer monitor, don't have special requirements and are willing to pay for quality, I think you will be more than happy with this beautiful device.
$review_summary.: Excellent Mid-Range Monitor

By that, I mean they don't seem to wear out but they must be replaced if you scratch it (or a curious grandchild peals the corners up!).

 The L100 was the right price and seemed simple enough for me to try.First, what I don't like:  No viewfinder, so if you break the LCD the camera is useless
 However, it was a chance I was willing to take since the price was low enough

 Second, it will only take movies for 25 minutes, then you will need to start up a new movie


 Usually my movies are less than that time anyway, but still I don't see a reason to limit the movie time if your SD card can handle a longer movie time
 Your battery life will be VERY low, once again because of the only LCD option, and you are not supposed to use rechargeable batteries


 so get used to buying a lot of double A's.Now what I do like:  It takes wonderful pictures, very warm, and is by far the simplest camera to use


 If you want a camera that lets you to adjust speed/light/etc then buy THAT type of camera, don't buy the simple ones for people that just want to take pictures


 This, is set up so even a child can take a good picture

 Back Light option takes great pictures of people in front of windows, Macro takes great close up, etc
 Zoom is awesome, although it doesn't work nearly as well when you are shooting a movie.So, for the money, definately a good purchase


 For a bit more money I would have liked a viewfinder, more movie time and more zoom capability while shooting in movie mode, other than that it's a wonderful camera.

(instead of attached to speaker with the rca plug)  This makes adding more length very easy, and allows you to use standard speaker wire.very nicely packaged, even included batteries for the remote.Cons?These are expensive especially for computer speakers.  Takes a pretty hard core pc guy to dish out nearly 400 dollars for speakers.  But its something you can use for years to come, that is if you take care of them.  This is probably the last of its kind, high end quality 5.1 system for a pc, especially one that has optical out, either on the pc motherboard/sound card, or speaker system that accepts it.I am impressed, excellent speakers.

The original CyberShot was much smaller and didn't have any zoom capability - but I would have purchased that camera over DSCS40.* Size - the DSCS40 is larger than previous CyberShots - I am assuming to house the zoom lens.* Battery Life - pretty good - even when using a flash* Shutter speed - I disagree with most of the reviews here - If you are outside with sunlight this is a great camera with good shutter speed


If you are inside and the flash is needed, you are going to be waiting 3 seconds for the camera to focus


Once the flash goes off, start counting to 5 before you can take another picture


If your subject moves, add another 3 secoonds to refocus
Again, my old 2MP CyberShot performed better...* VISIBAL LASER BEAM - No one else wrote about this


This is the first digital camera I've seen that has a visial laser that shoots out to determine lighting and the focus
Pointing lasers at people's eyes is always a bad idea


The camera's manual says that the laser is "safe" but it recommends not aiming at people's eyes (interesting)

If you have children, do not buy this camera because this laser is not a good idea


My previsous CyberShot and most other digital cameras (high and low cost) do not have this visial laser - why this camera does I'll never know.* Zoom lense - nice feature to have - glad its there
However, if you use the zoom, you have to be extra stable before taking the picture or it will result in a blurry picture.* Picture Stability - The camera has no automatic picture stabilization - make sure you are solid before taking the picture - I have many shots that I deleted because I moved just alittle bit


This occurs even when not using the zoom.* Memory - I've gone with the 3MP setting because the aspect ratio matches a 4x6 photo.* Flash - As stated above, it takes 5 seconds to recharge

Also, using the flash usually maeans the color will be whited-out (i.e., not great quality).* Picture Quality - Excellent when the lighting is good* Video - I haven't used it much - I pull out the digital video camera for that.* Price - Average camera for the price - This is a much better camera when outside in good lighting

However, it gets 2 stars because I expect more from Sony and for the price, there were better digital cameras I could have purchased.* Summary - My previous 2MP Cybershot left me with a great opinion of Sony's cameras
The DSCS40 Cybershot has damaged that reputation


I will definitely check Sony out for my next camera, but the usually reliable Amazon reviews really missed the boat on this one


People giving this 4-5 stars must have had really bad experiences with previous cameras to give the DSCS40 such a high rating
I don't know else how to explain it


I will be sure to test the camera and not just go off of reviews before purchasing in the future.

$REVIEW.: I have been throwing a 15 inch laptop in and out of this for about a month now and this is a nice durable solution for protecting your valuable PC or mac in transit.  The interior shed a little bit of its orange lining intially but that went away and I am left with a nicely designed sleeve that serves its function.  The 16" size is a nice fit even for a 15" system and I use excess as a kind of handle.  The zipper is high quality never snagging with a super durable feel to its handle and action.  A well made handsome solution to scratches and bumps.

As I am traveling a lot in US, Canada &amp; Europe, I tried to install Bell Canada SIM Card in my tablet, it did not work. I contacted Lenovo Canada, they did not have a clue why this card is not working, after this a called Lenovo USA and they told me something that I still do not believe: This Card ( that is obviously  locked to US providers) will work just in USA! And when I asked them to provide me with software to unlock card, they did not have answer. Tablet is nice product, but by my experience, stay away from them! Support is even to zero!

$REVIEW.: The Roadmate 5230T-LM is one of the newest GPS models that Magellan has to offer at the time of this writing. Although Magellan is the least popular of the big three GPS manufacturers with Tom-Tom and Garmin leading the way, let's see what it's got.Included in the box is the GPS itself, a suction cup windshield mount, a vehicle power cable that plugs into the lighter socket, and a USB cable for map updates and charging the battery off of a computer. It can also be charged off any standard USB charger like those used for a cell phone, so you don't need to leave a computer on. There is also a User Handbook, which just gives basic information to get you started.Although I know all of the manufacturers use the suction cup mounts for their GPS's, I dislike them. For some reason, they just seem to get in the way, are a pain to get off the window, and leave the tell-tale circle to let thieves know there could be a GPS in the vehicle. I prefer a non-slip dash mount instead, like this one:ME-USDM: i.Trek Universal Dashboard Mount with built-in holder for LG Nitro HD, Thrill 4G, Marquee, myTouch T, myTouch Ql, which I am going to order soon.This style of the GPS is quite nice, it feels slightly larger than a smart phone, and a little bit thicker. The case is made of black plastic, on the back is a small speaker, on the left side is the power outlet, and on the top right is the power switch. Besides the pinhole reset switch - that is the extent of connections on the unit. There is no audio out jack if you want to run it through you car's audio system. This unit does not have Bluetooth pairing, voice commands, or even an SD card slot for memory expansion.What is included with the Magellan Roadmate 5230T-LM is Lifetime Map Updates, and Lifetime Traffic Alerts. In order to get traffic alerts, the vehicle power cord must be plugged into the lighter/accessory socket in the car. I'm not sure if this is where the receiver is, or just the antenna, but be prepared to always use the cord when operating this unit. The battery does not last long, the manual indicates only 30 minutes when fully charged - and that takes about four hours.Before using the GPS, it is suggested to update the maps and firmware prior to using it. In order to do this, it is necessary to download the "Content Manager" software on a computer from the Magellan website. The software is available for both Mac and PC. The software installs quite easily, however when I connected the GPS to my MacBook Pro, The Content Manger failed to see the GPS which properly mounted on my desktop. Even switching USB ports did not help. The GPS mounted to the computer, but the software did not see it. I did not have a problem when mounting it to a PC. The Content Manger is an unimpressive piece of software with a clunky 90's style interface that does not have much to it. There is an address book interface that does not allow any sort of importing or exporting option to or from any address book or contacts software like Outlook, Windows Live, etc. You can only sync between the GPS and the Content Manager software. Any addresses need to be manually input from either device. So, if you already have a massive address book on your computer, you cannot use it. Basically, the only other thing that can be done on Content Manager with this model is update the maps, or buy additional Phantom Alert options. No Thank You. There are no celebrity voices, or different vehicles that you can download to the GPS, because there are no options to change them. Magellan allows limited customization to this unit. On the Roadmate 5230T-LM you are stuck with an arrow that represents your car, and a single female American voice to guide you (sorry no English accents available).The large five inch display on the GPS is quite sharp. It is bright, but like any backlit display it will bleach out a little in direct sunlight. What is nice is that my polarized sunglasses do not mosaic the display like the ATM at my local bank. Using the RoadMate 5230T-LM is pretty straight forward, and works any other GPS unit. To enter the destination, hit Menu, then address, type in the city, street address, then hit "Go!". The lady's voice will guide you along the way, just be sure not be blasting your car stereo, the small speaker has its limitations, but it is clear, and the volume level is acceptable. Directions will be displayed at the top, while the ETA will be displayed in the bottom left corner, if this tapped, a window pops up showing the distance, direction, speed, and time remaining. This window only lasts for about ten seconds. The touch screen is typical for a GPS unit, there is always a slight delay, and it needs a little bit of pressure, unlike a smartphone. It is more like a bank's ATM touchscreen.The One Touch feature is nice. It allows you to program in frequently used destination or search like if you want to know where a Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks is nearby. You can actually have a "Dunkin' Donuts" or "Starbucks" button on the One Touch display with the logo. Of course you can also program any address you would like, as well.I have not had any problems with the RoadMate's routing. Every time I have used it, it has taken me the route I would have taken myself. The Junction view is nice, it greys out the route you don't want to take, and shows arrows where you should be going. The traffic alerts pop up in time to change the route, however, I found the alternate routes a little hard to read, they needed to be in a larger, darker font. The traffic alert symbol is a red triangle on the bottom left of the map and has a time below it, though I have yet to find any documentation as to what the time actually means. Even on the website, I can't find this information.I have yet to hear the GPS use "Landmark Guidance" which tells you to "turn right at the Exxon Gas Station" instead of just turning right. I also have not seen the visual warning I have set for going 5mph over the posted speed limit, when travelling on the Garden State Parkway.I know all of the GPS makers have a problem with Points of Interest. Magellan is no exception. One example is when I looked up Grocery Stores near my house. It listed an "Edwards Super Food Store", which has been gone for at least ten years, replaced by a "Shopper's World", which is listed, however is not a supermarket. The unit incorrectly lists many other places such as "Harley Davidson &amp; Buell of Edison" and "Supreme Manufacturing Co." as Grocery Stores? I don't think I will be going there for a gallon of milk! The obvious Shop-Rite, Pathmark, Stop &amp; Shop and Acme in town are NOT listed under "Grocery Stores". If only Magellan provided a way for users to update their database.Overall, despite the RoadMate's  5230T-LM's limitations, it is a pretty nice unit. It does not have the customization that other units have, and it seems kind of expensive for what you get compared to other ones with similar features. My advice would be to shop around and compare all of the newest units out there first.

Like others here I ordered and received a shipping notice.  When it hadn't arrived 2 weeks later, I emailed and they told me there was a mixup in their warehouse.  I received the unit 2 days later.  Not sure why I had to contact them first to find out what was going on.The case itself I like in a lot of ways.  I think it looks very classy, and I feel like it provides great protection for the tablet.  I like being able to take the tablet out of the folio portion and hold it without keeping the cover flap back behind it.  The back of the interior tablet case feels really nice to hold.It does quite a large amount of bulk to the unit.  It's nice that you can shed the outer layer, and it doesn't feel so bulky, but it's a number of extra layers.  I think this provides good protection and versatility, but it is bulky.  So far it hasn't bothered me too much, but we'll see as I travel with it in the coming months.I like the versatility of propping the tablet up landscape or portrait.  I don't have any problems doing either.  It is very important WHERE you place the table on the velcro height-wise, if you want it to stay propped up.  Just place it like in the photos and you'll be fine.  I have no problem whatsoever reaching the power and volume buttons.The velcro makes me nervous to some degree, don't know how long it will last.  I don't want it to fail and my tablet goes flying out of the outer folio one day when I pick it up.Overall, a mixed bag.  But I will use it for the next month or so and see how it holds up and how I like it in real life situations.

$review_text.: These are the real deal and fit perfect


My only complaint is that the headset seems to have these come off too easily

Wish they locked/grabbed on better


But that is a design problem, not this products problem
good thing its easy to buy replacements.


$review_summary.: Fit great, good price

$REVIEW.: This is really a great lens.  It's sharp, renders beautifully, and has amazing hand holdability in low light situations.  You can literally take pictures at night with this lens without using a flash.  If it's bright enough to see with the human eye, odds are you can get proper exposure with this lens without a flash.So as an available light lens for capturing candid moments indiscreetly, it is absolutely unparallelled. I mention this first because one might be confused as to how to properly utilize a 24mm F1.4 lens.  It's generally too short for portraits and won't generate a ton of background blur without getting uncomfortably close to your subject.  It generally won't be as useful to nearly as many people as a good 50/1.4 or 85/1.4 (or any classic portrait lens).However, as a photojournalistic tool it is an absolute gem.  I use it for weddings and the flexibility of this lens over the 16-35/2.8 II is pretty staggering.  The 16-35/2.8 zooms, but the 24/1.4 can take in FOUR TIMES as much light.  It's really hard to understate how valuable that can be.Technically the lens is very good.  Sharpness is very good over most of the frame at large apertures.  At small apertures, it's excellent across the frame on a full frame sensor. Focusing is very picky.  The combination of wide angle with fast aperture is difficult for most 5 series or lesser camera bodies to get right.  I have to be more careful with this lens than I do my 50/1.2 or 85/1.4 - even though the latter technically have less DOF.  Build quality of this lens is superb - fitting of it's price tag.This is an expensive lens, but for what it is, this lens is the best of it's kind.

$review_text.: Beware,This zip drive does not come blank.  In fact, it comes formatted as two partitions (drives), and a program called SanDisk Cruze is installed on the first partition - which takes up space that you could otherwise use.  The program also causes a Mac to crash, Win7 to crash, and Win XP to freeze.  You're essentially buying something that causes you grief rather than helps you.  2GB isn't a whole lot to start with, but after they install their UNREMOVABLE programs, you don't even have 2 GB left.  And yes, the preinstalled programs are unremovable. You can't even reformat the zip drive. You are stuck with games and other junk that just takes up space.  This drive wouldn't even be worth it if it sold for one dollar.

$review_text.: I have tried several keyboard, mouse, trackball stand-alones and combos and I have to say that this one from Logitech is one of the best I have used with my Windows OS home theater setup.Pros:-Small, lightweight, compact keyboard/touchpad combo package-Logitech quality, durability, and support-Logitech Unifying Receiver (allowing for multiple devices to by synced to one receiver)-Great for Windows-based Home Theater use-Windows button for easy Start Button (Win XP &amp; 7) and Start Screen (Win 8) access-Windows 8 gesture support-Excellent battery lifeCons:-Recessed touchpad SOMEWHAT difficult to use with Windows 8 - but not impossible-Non-dedicated Home and End buttons for more difficult word processing accessibility (but not being a full-sized keyboard, this is understandable and does has this capability using the FN and directional arrow keys)Of course, the best feature of this device is the integrated touch pad that works well with any Windows-based home theater setup. I will say that when used in conjunction with my Win 8 PC, the recessed nature of the trackpad doesn't allow for easy use of the top-down and left/right-swipe features integrated into the Win 8 OS, but it is manageable with practice. These Win 8 OS gesture features CAN be used on this device's touchpad, but not without being VERY deliberate with ensuring you are touching right at the very edge of the recessed touchpad.If you've used these features on a touch screen tablet or Logitech's Rechargeable Touchpad T650 with your PC, then you can appreciate the functionality and ease of using the top/left/right swipe to access the various menus the Win 8 OS offers, but the physically recessed touchpad on this keyboard/touchpad combo makes it a little more difficult to manipulate - but not impossibly so.There is also a nifty &amp;#34;left-mouse&amp;#34; button at the upper left corner of the unit that makes two-handed operation of this device easy and intuitive. Just grip the keyboard combo with both hands, one at the left side, the other at the right, and use your right thumb to navigate using the touchpad, and your left thumb to click on the desired icons, etc. using the &amp;#34;left mouse&amp;#34; button in the upper left corner of the keyboard. Easy as that!!Overall, this combo device is a great addition to any PC-based home theater system and the Logitech Unifying receiver makes the setup process a breeze. Also, battery life is outstanding and should last for many months with regular use.I hope that in future designs of this keyboard, Logitech should make the surface of the touchpad level with the surface of the keyboard body (like most modern laptops). This would make it more easy to use with the Win 8 gestures.Again, this makes for a great KB/mouse combo for any PC and/or home theater setup!

$REVIEW.: i mine cryptocurriences as a hobby, and as a result i run linux on most of my rigs. since it's easier to maintain the rigs if they are connected via ethernet, i needed a way to do so in areas of my home that were far from the router. this device will connect wireless-ly to your router, and then you can plug your computers into the ethernet ports and it will share the connection between all the connected devices.  my only complaint is that the signal strength seems very weak, and as a result my network speeds suffer. i have one of these in the garage and my router is in the room upstairs directly above it, so i had expected to get a better signal.

$review_text.: Both my wife and I own a GPS.  Hers is a Garmin Nuvi 250W and mine is the Magellan 1470.  Both units are mounted on a portable friction mounts, hers on theGarmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for n&amp;uuml;vi Series and StreetPilot C5XX Series GPS Navigators (C530, C550, and C580)and mine on the NAVGEAR universal dash mount.What I liked most about the NAVGEAR mount is that the 1470's mounting suction cup makes and maintains excellent contact with the mounting base so there is little risk of accidental release from the base.  When I want to release my GPS, the 1470 and the mounting base can be easily separated and then just as easily re-attached. They remain securely joined until I release them.What I don't like about the NAVGEAR mount is the lack of grip when using it on the dash. The lack of grip has resulted in constant risk of my GPS sliding across the dash or into my passenger's or my lap when making even a slightly hard turn and especially a sudden stop. I've had several experiences already where it literally flew across the dash and onto the floor. On the other hand, the grip on the Garmin friction mount has not once failed to hold in all but the most severe maneuvers and is by far superior to what the NAVGEAR offers.  The material used on the bottom of NAVGEAR feels less flexible/firmer and although slightly textured, somewhat smooth.  The material on the bottom of the Garmin mount feels somewhat softer and more pliable - almost slightly sticky.Bottom line - if you're considering the NAVGEAR ME201133 Universal Dash Mount for a Garmin Nuvi, spend the money on the Garmin friction mount noted above.  You will be much more satisfied.  For other GPS brands, the NAVGEAR mount may be a reasonable alternative although you will have to live with the constant risk of your GPS slipping and sliding across the dash and onto the floor unless you find a way to improve the grip.

 It fit my car perfectly, giving me a RAM Mount without scratching or damaging the interior in any way.Note that it will wobble a bit if you don't secure it

 In my case, a small piece of pipe insulation give it enough thickness to hold it against the center console.

The mounting style of this is quite different than the bullet camera's, but should present no problems at all by looking at the hardware. These seem to be intended for mounting under a soffit or on a ceiling primarily, where a bullet style is more flexible in where it can be mounted, in my opinion. Tamper proof? That's almost funny. No camera is whip cream proof, lol

Case and point.If it's still available it's probably the last of the Audigy chipset cards made. If you like them and need a PCI card, get it but be sure to use the drivers from the web site NOT on the disc. Just take the disc (unopened) and put it away for safe keeping. It will not work on anything above Windows XP.And this is from a lifetime Creative fan. I have given them SO MUCH money I should own part of the company... :)

$REVIEW.: It's not a bad little camera, but one big thing I found is it's hard to get a decent steady shot. Most any camcorder your going to need a tripod, and this one is no exception.  The image can become shaky even though the zoom is quite smooth. You can really notice the shakiness when at full zoom. The still pictures left a lot to be desired.It has not only an easy mode but the settings most wanna be pro videographers want as well. Most people will probably just set it on auto and go, which is probably best since playing with some of the settings manually didn't improve the video that much.I think given its size this is probably something that's great for the mom or dad that wants something offers a bit more than a Flip style video camera will give you.

Not a big hairy deal. And the result is pretty good, very good actually. But I could do without the bottom plate. It does nothing to add to the grip's usefulness.

It slid to the side of the box making direct contact with the cardboard thus no protection. I dont know if it was damaged but it makes a lot more noise than previous drive. I can hear the clicking as the drive is running. Those whom gave it a silent review can you hear the processing clicking?
