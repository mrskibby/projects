$review_text.: I am new to wireless triggers and this is my first ever purchase


I have been wanting to pick up something but did not want top spend Pocket Wizard kind of money

I have thought about picking up some Cybersyncs instead but still wanted to spend less


I have never owned anything made by Yongnuo and have heard varying reviews on their products

Starting with packaging, they did a great job

Nice box, well packed, easily setup

I am using these with a Canon 40d and some Yongnuo YN-560 speed lights that I purchased on this order

I bought 3 strobes and two sets of the RF-603's, enough for each strobe and one for my camera
Connections to camera and strobes was easy but there is no threads on them to screw to a light stand
You can hang them via a sync cable or use an adapter for your stands with a cold shoe foot


My stands have adapters with a thumb screw to tighten your strobes so they stay tight.Testing involved setting up two strobes on 7 foot light stands and one on a foot that came with the flash
Each had a RF-603 attached and were placed around the room
I attached another RF-603 to my camera and fired off several frames at various sync speeds.I was able to maintain a consistent sync speed of 1/250 and pushed it up to 1/320 with very little signs of the rear curtain
Could I get away with 1/320? Yes, so long as I frame the shot accordingly

I did attempt 1/400 but lost about 1/4 of the shot to the rear curtain
In my opinion, these will maintain sync speeds for most shooters.I also tested wirelessly triggering the camera using the included sync cable and it works perfectly


For this setup, I took a RF-603 off on of my strobes and set it to slave mode


I then fired off several shots remotely without any issues.I have not done any long range tests because it has been raining pretty bad here in Florida
I will update this review when I get more details.From the testing that I have done so far, I can say that I am VERY impressed with these
I would recommend them to anyone wanting to start shooting wirelessly

Build quality is top notch and they just work, period.

$REVIEW.: I upgraded to this motherboard from a Dell XPS 8500 and let me tell you, I see the difference.  I really enjoyed the ease of use with setting it up and connecting everything to it.  I've read some complaints that the sata positioning is weird (it doesn't come out perpendicular to the board (at you), but there are positioned where the plug runs parallel to the board (to the right).  It worked well for me because I ran the sata's around the back side of the case and was able to sneak them right in.  I actually prefer them that way.The board is labeled very clearly and has 2 CPU fan inputs and 3 system fan inputs.  I was able to get in a pretty big CPU heatsink and fan, the RAM, my two MSI GTX OC Power Edition 670s with plenty of room to spare.  Everything fit beautifully and I ran into no problems with connecting everything.If you're looking to SLI or Crossfire, this board does not come with the required bridge cables.  Make sure you have one or buy one when ordering this board.  It only supports 2-way SLI, but it does support 3-way Crossfire.  The PCI-e 2 and 5 slot have a large space in between them so there is plenty of room for two GPUs, but I would imagine if your GPU is very big and you're trying to Crossfire 3 AMD GPUs, the PCI-e slot 7 is pretty close to not only the PSU (if you're case has the PSU at the bottom), but to the connectors for the case, fan inputs, etc.  I didn't try to connect one of my 670s to that last one to test it, but it would be a tight fit for sure.Once I tinker with the Bios a bit more I'll update my review.  But for the first week, it's been silky smooth.

$REVIEW.: Love these headphones! I am not much of a headphone user other than when I exercise, but these puppies are AMAZING!Upon opening the box you know you've got a nice piece of electronics. The brown, white and gold-like colors are reminiscent of Gucci and as such, these headphones live up to that similarity.When I workout out I use the Jaybird Freedom wireless BT earphones, which themselves are pretty amazing, but I did not realize what I was missing until I tested the Polk phones - bass is deep, voices are clear and they do a good job of canceling the sounds around you which allows you to immerse yourself in your music.My gripe with these headphones are as follows:- the ear muffs themselves do not rotate, only move back and forth and makes me feel like if they did rotate, I would have a better fit (though I'm not sure if any of similar headphones muffs rotate).- The cord is on the right side instead of having the option to switch it to whichever side you want (has that been invented yet?)- Because these are a high end piece of equipment, I'm afraid of tearing or scuffing the ear muffs as the skin seems to be pretty thin.Other than that, I highly recommend these phones.
$SUMMARY.: Amazing piece of audio equipment!

$review_text.: I received one of these as a review sample and was pleased by how easy it was to install and configure. If you own a digital TV everything you need is in the box.This antenna is not going to pull signals out of thin air, but if you are getting any kind of reception of local channels it will make them come in clearly. The best way to determine if this will work for you in your specific area is to scan through your channels on your TV. If you are receiving any stations - however marginal - then this will probably work. I live within thirty miles of some stations that I could select, but the video and audio quality were so poor that there was no need to bother. This antenna brought them in crystal clear as though I were on cable (which I am not). More importantly, a scan right after I installed this revealed additional channels that I did not know about.One of the things that impressed me about this kit is the antenna itself. It's almost as though it's made from fabric and can be laid flat, attached to a window or on the included stand. Wiring is simple too. I would have loved it had the amplified that's included been powered by a USB port instead of the wall wart transformer. My TV has USB, which would have powered it a lot more easily than my having to use an extension cord to get power to the transformer, but that is a minor issue.If you can received HDTV over the air signals in your locale this will allow you to watch them as though you were receiving them over cable - most of the time. My area gets frequent thunderstorms and a lot of rain in the summer and those do interfere with the reception quality this provides. But on a clear day ... you can see forever. Definitely recommended as one way to get off cable.

$REVIEW.: This device is great, this is actually the second one of the GoGroove devices that I have purchased. There are some things people should know before buying.1. This device can't be turned off. Some other devices that are similar can be turned off but this one can not. If you have it plugged in it will connect to your phone.2. This device will auto play your music when it connects. This is either a good thing or a bad thing. If you always plan on using the device it's great, but if you only want to use it occasionally then you will need to unplug it. Else you will be playing music in the background without knowing it, potentially using data and wasting your battery.Other than those two items I love the device.

$review_text.: I have several of these for my SLR camera. They function as expected and have a faster save time when I am shooting repeating shots. It will almost keep up with the camera at 3 shots/sec. After about 30 shots in RAW format, the camera slows down. My buffer will only hold about 12 shots so the card is only slightly slower than my camera can feed the photos.

Partly because I have an XBox and like to install some games to run faster, but also because I find it a convenient way to transfer files from Mac to PC. This drive is very good and the write speeds are excellent. In my non scientific studies, transferring 1.5Gb took approximately 1 and a half minutes. This is very good for USB2 flash drives and beats most of my other drives.In another comparison, If I install a 7.8Gb game on the XBox, it takes approximately 30 minutes with a SanDisk Cruzer 16Gb and under 15 minutes with this drive.I had no problems with shipping or with Amazon and if you contact their customer support they are usually VERY responsive.

$review_text.: Note that this records in mp4 format. The video is fairly clear, in normal lighting. It has a macro mode that goes from 1 cm, and ISO up to 3200, with the usual caveats about noise. No 16:9 format, though.Sleek-looking and waterproof to five feet, it's sleekness and waterproofness has probably contributed to its couple of shortcomings, both in the usability department.First, in the name of waterproofing, the battery, memory and AV connection are locked behind a slim door under the control pad. This means when the door is open to accomodate the AV cable, it's hard to use the already mushy control pad - its hinge is just under the pad, so the open door gets in the way of the pad.The pad itself must be made of some rubbery membrane underneath, because, as mentioned, it feels loose and mushy, both the selection button and the directional pad around it.It has 5x optical zoom, and supposedly face detection to boost its anti-shake. However, at zoom, some jitteriness is still noticeable. The sound is pretty good, at least from recording our band practice.Its menus are easy enough to navigate. Battery life is iffy, don't expect more than about an hour's worth for video.The case is a weird, tight-fitting, half-open design, and there is no lens cover. I suppose since it's waterproof, the lens must be ruggedized anyway.

$REVIEW.: With the price that I paid, this was suitable for the 8 year old who received it as a Christmas gift. Not too long after a year, it had trouble reading some of the initial tracks of a cd, but with patience, it pulls through. It never leaves the house, and never gets dirty, so I couldn't blame it on misuse. It's a decent little radio for someone who is not an audiophile, and doesn't have complicated parts that can go bad, like an automated cd drawer. Really, it is a large awkward walkman cd player, with two speakers. I can't be too hard on it. Its price was fair, and it has totally served its purpose of providing our daughter with the ability of listening to her own cds in her room.

$review_text.: I've loved all of my Tivos. I've had several of them over the years. Most recently, our Tivo Series 3 has been great for recording over the air TV since we cut the cord a year ago. We've been using it with a rooftop antenna, and it's been working great. Then the hard drive died on the Series 3. It was nearly 7 years old, and a new Premiere is only $99. So I thought, why not get the new thing, and save the trouble of replacing the hard drive? So I got a Premiere. That was a mistake, because the OTA tuner for the Premiere is awful. Really and truly awful. Channels that we have no trouble getting on the Series 3, or on the regular TV, or on the other TV, just won't come in on the Premiere. Plugged in to the exact same antenna cable, a sea of pixelation and dropped channels. After some diagnostic work, it appears that the tuners on the Premiere don't handle multipath signals well, and this was my problem. It's apparently a common problem with the Premiere.Essentially, I have two options. I could spend a couple hundred dollars getting someone up onto my roof to improve an antenna system that works just fine for everything else, or I could return the Premiere, and just replace the hard drive in my old Series 3. I returned the Premiere and spent the afternoon getting the old Series 3 working again with a new hard drive, and all is well again. Except that now I have to go to the trouble of sending the Premiere back to Amazon, and calling Tivo to cancel the subscription.I did have a chance to try the new features of the Premiere before I returned it. There's not a single new feature on the Premiere that I don't have on the Series 3, except for the HD menu system, which I personally thought was cluttered and hard to navigate (just personal preference). I went back to the SD menus after about 20 minutes.All in all, not a good experience. I still love my Tivo, just not this one.

$REVIEW.: There was only one review that somebody used it in Panasonic GH2 camera, so I thought that I should add this one, just in case if the owners of this camera are searching for related reviews.After inserting the card into the camera I had to agree with a question for reformatting the card, which is normal. It seems that Panasonic GH2 has reformatted it with exFAT because Win7 is showing that. It is also showing that the capacity is at 61.8GB, which is also normal. Actually this space is more than I expected, since after formatting you usually lose almost 10% of the space.My Panasonic GH2 is estimating that this card would be enough to fit 6 hours and 22 minutes of HBR (24 Mbits/s) video. So far I've just taped 30 minutes and it is still working and hopefully will continue in the same manner. If there will be hiccups I'll immediately return to Amazon with an updated review and will take off some stars.Reading from the card, while copying to the PC, averaged at 19.6 MB/s. Writing to the card (the same data) has averaged 15.7 MB/s. See pictures and captions for details. I get the same performance from my SanDisk 32GB SDHC Extreme HD VideoSanDisk Extreme SD 32  GB SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDX-032Gcard that claims "up to 30 MB/s" transfer speeds. I don't use fancy tests. Instead, I use daily footage so it's all down to earth, without any illusions about performance.One will have difficult time believing that an unknown company, such as KomputerBay is able to deliver memory cards on the same level as SanDisk, Transcend, or Kingston. The only couple explanations that I can find are:a) a necessity of one of these companies to offload overproduction of a certain modelb) or some batches of the cards have not met strict quality requirements. Maybe this batch had 4 bad cards out of every 100 comparing to the expected 1 bad card for each 1,000?The card, that I've received, did not have the country of origin on it. Since my recent SanDisk 32GB SDHC Extreme HD Video (30 MB/s claimed) card was made in China, so I thought that by purchasing KomputerBay the risks would be similar.The Amazon listing stated "Lifetime warranty" but since the card has not arrived with any extensive packaging (except a white label, see a photo) it is not clear how the warranty can be claimed, if the card will stop working in a few months.One more note. Both of my recent cards (SanDisk and KomputerBay) have a strange nuance. If the video files have been written by the camera, then the average reading speed is at 19.6 MB/s. But if the same files were written by the PC, the reading speed, while copying these files back to the PC, averages at 150 MB/s. It seems that there is a substantial difference between how Win7 and Panasonic GH2 write data to both cards, hence a jump in the reading speed. By the way, defragmenting data, written by the camera, does not improve the reading speed.Hopefully other reviewers will provide more details about the cameras and devices where they use this card, so there is less anxiety. It is especially appreciated when people post reviews and updates after a few months of using memory cards. Thank you!UPDATE from April 7th, 2012:During last few days the cards started to act up. Five days ago, GH2 during the same video session, stated (suddenly, after four-five video clips) something about the insufficient speed of the card and stopped videotaping. I had to reinsert the card in order to continue. Then, today, while watching footage on Panasonic BD45 Blu-ray player, the playing suddenly stopped. I've been copying the files after each video session, but at the same time not moving them, in order to make sure that the entire capacity of the card is usable. Well, only half the card (38GB) is filled so far and these problems are already apparent. Also, after the problem in the player, I continued using the card in the camera, and again, after a few clips, the camera reported "insufficient speed of the card" and stopped recording the video. Re-inserting the card eventually helped.If one compares this card with similar cards from SanDisk and Kingston, one can notice that this card is THINNER and the contacts are sitting DEEPER in the plastic. After scrutinizing the appearance of the contacts it is possible to notice that they are shiny/glossy and have less scratches on them from insertion/reinsertion than the cards from the above mentioned brands. I am not an expert, but logic tells me that such contacts will have less chance to stay tight to the contacts of the digital devices, hence more chance for a trouble.This card got my five stars when I've purchased it and tested six weeks ago. Now I am downgrading it to one star for being UNRELIABLE and forcing consumers to spend money again for purchasing something that can hold in the field. No wonder why the price has dropped by 10% during last few weeks! With more time on the market, more consumers will discover the long-term non-lasting quality of the card and the more the company will be interested to get rid of the current stock as fast as possible.The card has not failed completely yet and I will continue filling it (while making backup copies of the content on regular basis) with videos up to its maximum. However, if you are looking for a card for traveling, where you will not be able to copy to the computer on regular basis, consider SanDisk or something else. Yes, they are priced 150% higher than this card, but sometimes you can catch them on sale for almost the same price as this card. Just be patient.UPDATE from April 8th, 2012:In the middle of the video recording the camera again showed a message about insufficient speed. After reinserting the card, the GH2 could not recognize the card at all. And, of course, the return window has expired a week ago, but I was still able to get 80% refund. I love you Amazon! Will shop again, but not for this brand. I guess I'll stick with SanDisk, Kingston, and Transcend, unless they will develop as many problems as KomputerBay.UPDATE from April 23rd, 2012:One more thing... I've recalled that after having more than half the card filled with videos, the startup time of the camera and the recording time after stopping video recording has noticeable increased. I am not sure whether it was happening due to the quality of the card or due to the volume of the recorded data, or due to the capacity of the card... When I had to switch back to 8GB Transcend and 32GB SanDisk, it seems that the startup and and the "finish recording" lag quite noticeably shortened. However, I don't have 64GB SDXC from another brand (yet) in order to compare objectively.
$SUMMARY.: Using it in Panasonic GH2

$REVIEW.: I received the product on time and the packaging was great but upon opening and inspection I found 17 of the cases broken. The parts don't fit together well either but they still serve their purpose so I don't care because the price was right and you get what you pay for. I think that this item is worth purchasing if you don't mind imperfection. They aren't the same as the case you would get when you buy your favorite music but they will do.

$review_text.: I love this remote so much I bought a second one. I have Windows 7 Media Center and bought a used remote for it and it worked fine. I also have a Ceton to play my MCE on another TV and the remote that comes with it is terrible. Buttons are too close and small and very unresponsive. I decided to look for a replacement remote and came across this one and based on reviews I bought one and out of the box it worked great, no setup needed. Just point and use. I liked it so much I bought one to replace my one that worked just fine on the MCE computer itself mainly so my wife can have the same remote on both TV's and she is very happy. For that one I had to plug in the USB receiver but it setup very easy and by using the supplied USB extension cable I was able to place it where I can use the remote from two positions I pivot the TV for viewing. My one wish is that the remote had a built in &#34;back&#34; or &#34;previous channel&#34; button. But I will not give a lower rating for that, just would be nice. I read a blog that I can reprogram the MCE via computer but don't want to make it different from the other remote I have that I cannot program.

$REVIEW.: Pay more and get a Logitech or other name brand. There's no identification on the mouse I have saying what brand it is other than specifications and that it's made in China. The batteries keep coming out of position in the one I have. The cursor doesn't move every time I move the mouse, it doesn't sync up. No documentation or disc came with the mouse so I have no idea if this would be a warranty issue or the mouse is just picky about what surface it needs to be used on. The mouse supposedly has a warranty but since nothing came in the box saying who would replace the mouse, I wouldn't buy it with that thought in mind. I did find that the mouse seems to work better on a magazine than a mouse pad if that helps anyone else.

$review_text.: I am very pleased to have purchased these glasses. I dropped a pair of the ones that came with the T.V. they only came with a nylon type draw string bag offering no protection from a 12 inch fall from a lower cabinet.I discovered the broken glass's after I handed a pair to my wife. I put mine on and we were going to watch Green Lantern in 3D  since we only saw the 2D version in the theatre knowing the 3D quality is better on our T.V.My Wife exclaimed hey these are not working what do you see? I replied 3D of course did you turn them on? She replied yes and handed them to me I saw immediately what had happened the cheaply made glass's from Samsung had cracked in such a way that the lens material had separated. This is the best way to describe it unless you have ever seen a calculator screen broken it is hard to imagine. No cracks just layer seperation.Either way the glass's were broken and unusable we watched the Show in 2D I was upset to say the least. A 12 inch drop to a tile floor I mean crap what lousy luck. It took me a while to get over that bit of clumsiness on my part. They should still be tougher than that 12 inches for that drop and no more, maybe even less.Time has passed and more and more of the movies we like are being released to 3D so I bit the bullet and bought these glass's. I am glad I did.1. The lenses are lighter in color than the Samsung originals but produce the same and possibly better quality 3D effects.2. The frames are a little larger not by much but comfortable to wear3. Charging by mini usb using a computer is not something I like but not a deal breaker I would prefer coin batteries.4.The case they come in is truly protective I like that, that pesky thing called gravity has a way of pulling things to the floor.All in all a good purchase I would buy again with no regret lets just hope I don't have to.

$review_text.: I bought this case for my GF's Touchpad (I have the HP folio case on mine) as she prefers leather cases. Upon receiving the item, I noticed it was a well made item that fit the Touchpad well. However, there were some issues:1) The TP uses gestures to close apps or webpages. This gesture is a swipe from the bezel towards to center of the screen. With this case on, I found it difficult to perform this gesture because only about 1/8" of the screen is exposed and the rest of the bezel is covered by the case.2) There is a flap that folds under the TP to keep it in place. However, since this flap is at the bottom (when TP is held in landscape mode with home button to your right), I noticed the TP slides down a bit making the swiping from the bezel towards the center of the screen practically impossible. I found myself constantly pushing the TP up so the bottom of the screen/bezel can be exposed. They should've used some kind of velcro type closure to prevent the sliding.I fixed the second issue by using small strips of velcro tape. I put a piece on the flap and the inside of the case so when you fold the flap in, the velcro keeps the flap from loosening. This made the TP stay in place and made the swiping easier (still not idea as you kind of have to stick your finger between the case and screen to do it right).Overall, I would not recommend this case as it makes the gestures somewhat difficult to perform. But the case is well made and seem very durable and stylish. If you can live with a little difficulty in swiping, then this may work for you. My GF ended up keeping the case because she liked the build and look of the case.

$review_text.: The 3M screens comes pre-cut for standard sized laptop screens -- mine is a wide format 12.1" screen, but just about all the other standard sizes are available.  It attaches easily with five stick-on tabs, and you can remove it easily, although I don't bother to do that.  You can see the screen perfectly head-on and maybe 10 degrees to either side, with a very slight loss of brightness. Someone sitting next to you on a plane or at Starbucks sees a black screen.  They may wonder what the heck you're doing typing into a laptop that appears to be turned off.  (If they're sitting directly behind you, your screen will still be visible.) The value really registered on me last week when I sat next to a guy on a trans-Atlantic flight who didn't have one of these.  He spend many hours working on a PowerPoint presentation that was completely visible to me, and which included financial information that was confidential.  If you use your laptop to work on private things in a public place, get one of these screens and charge it to your employer.

$review_text.: I hate zoom lenses, I always feel they are soft

 I have used dozens and there are few that I like (1 or 2)

 This is the best zoom lens I have used, IMHO it is heads, shoulders and knees above the performance of the 18-70mm kit lens (which I used for about 1 month) and the 18-200mm vr (which I rented for a weekend and thought it was garbage, it could have been a bad copy I suppose)
 Speaking of sharpness..


I have the 50 f/1.4 and the Tamron macro 90mm f/2.8 which I consider to be my 2 sharpest lenses

 If you are as picky as I am about softness then this lens is for you
 It is as sharp as the fixed fifty (1.4) and the macro and both of those are known for being RAZOR sharp
 I typically shot between 30 and 55mm with this lens and I am rarely disappointed

 I suggest renting it for a weekend, that is what I did, shot a few hundred exposures, if you do not like it, don't buy it

 Consequently if you get mugged while holding this lens it could be used to defend yourself, it is ridiculously well built and solid

In my opinion this is the best zoom lens for the nikon D series, good choice for those who are picky about sharpness.

I am using this for camera lenses and can't put a lens in the bottom two compartments.  I figured out a 'work-round' using two compartment dividers to pad the wheel housings, but then I lose two compartments.2)  The dividers are not good for camera equipment.  the compartments are too large for lenses and too small for a camera with lens mounted.  Other cases that I have include velcro on the sides of the dividers so you can divide the compartments in half again.  These dividers do not.Pelican is supposed to be outstanding.

Impalas 00'-05 have a large dashboard lip just above the stereo. so where this will technically fit in the double-din slot, it wont function properly as it prevents the screen from extending to an angle that is reasonable. It was tilted down towards the cup holder.Luckily, unlike some other customers, all of my equipment arrived in great condition. It wired up just fine, although took a little longer than the more popular brands of stereos. Keep in mind you'll need to purchase the appropriate wiring harness for your car as well as any safety adapters.For this price range, you cant really do much better, But throwing a few more dollars at a piece of equipment you will be using for quite sometime is totally worth it.

There are a bunch of tabs around it to mate up with different vehicles, and you have to cut of the ones that don't belong there for your application. A dremel tool with a cut off wheel would be handy. I managed with a  hack saw and being careful.The 1.5 DIN space is a pain to deal with. I like the small pocket space better than the alternative which is a flat piece of plastic that centers the 1 DIN radio in the middle. The small crevice is good for stuffing a map, directions, or the cord to your mp3 player.I'd prefer it was built a little stronger, but it was the best option out there for a Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ, and I'm happy with it so far.

$REVIEW.: After blowing hard-earned cash on a variety of uncomfortable and poorly designed "heat shields" "lap desks" and so forth, I decided to give this simple shield a go.I absolutely love it.  I've had my first one for two years, and I just bought a 2nd for my 2nd laptop (yes, i am a computer junky).PROS:- if you rest your laptop on your bed, a base like this that lifts your laptop off the bed and at the same time provides space underneath it is absolutely essential IMO. Most laptops' air intake is on the bottom.  When you put it on something that impedes that airflow--e.g. blankets, mattresses, comforters being the worst offenders - your laptop can rapidly overheat even its own cooling is normally sufficient.  That can mean burning out your CPU or GPU.This stiff, raised, slotted surface allows plenty of air to reach the intake as long as you are not silly enough to drop both the heatshield and the laptop on such a deep comforter as to suffocate both.- on the lap, it provides a good heatshield, a nice stiff surface to support heavy typing, and its native passive cooling effect.- simple design doesn't require power.CONS- if your laptop runs EXTREMELY hot, you will eventually begin to feel the heat through the shield.  I do not run gaming laptops so this has not been a particular problem, but i do run into it occasionally on my i3.I did use this heatshield with a gaming laptop originally and it wasn't perfect, but it was far better than anything else i used--none of which were active cooling products.  I just wasn't sure they were worth the investment; after wasting money on a few products that were really useless, I just didn't have much faith i wouldn't end up wasting more.  Obviously that doesn't mean that there aren't good active cooling heat shields out there and if you have a gaming laptop that doesn't have sufficient internal cooling (mine did), and the cash, you may be better off with active fans in your base.

$REVIEW.: Put this in a Silverstone GD05B case as a fan controller for an HTPC application. Easy to install, appears to be well made, and the mesh design looks pretty cool with the case. Not much to say about it. It works, and allows you to control up to 5 fans independently from each other. I guess you could go with a touchscreen LCD version, but for my application, I wanted to maintain a low light discipline, so I wouldn't be distracted while watching a movie/tv. It does have a white LED light, but it is not overly distracting, and can be covered if needed. All in all, pretty good for what it is.

$REVIEW.: This product actually looks pretty nice and works well. But it is bulky. I bought the Astro Slim2 for my wife and she loves that one. I had to carry her phone at time with the Slim2 charger attached, didn't bother me much. I tried to carry this one attached to my phone and after some time it bothered me. With the Slim2 I can place the phone on top of the charger with no problem but not with the Jackery bar.The LED for me is only useful for discharging the battery before recharging. I don't see why I would need to use it for any other purpose given the bulk of it.As for the actual charge it holds, other reviewers have a much better idea. I was able to charge HTC Vivid ~2.5 times before I need to recharge the Jackery Bar. About the same when I used it to charge HTC One. Works for me.

$REVIEW.: These have the design where the cord is very short on the left ear


I have only seen this on mobile phone headsets and have no idea why Sennheiser would do that on a set of headphone without a microphone

It puts the cord pressure all on one ear and makes them very uncomfortable to wear


I assume it will also cause the left ear to short-out over time as other reviewers have noted

The cord is also very noisy and the sound quality isn't anything special IMO.

$review_text.: This is my second Acer netbook (and the fourth in our household), replacing a D250 model with a 10.1" screen. (My other computer is a 15" MacBook Pro.) The extra bit of screen size on this 11.6" Acer makes a huge difference compared to the D250, and the quality of the display is excellent. Obviously the processer is an upgrade over the Atom in the D250, as is Windows 7 over XP. The addition of the HDMI port (without deleting the still-necessary VGA port) is very helpful as well, and the new design of the power cord (small brick on the plug itself, with a reconfigurable head and built-in velcro strap) is a significant improvement over its already svelte two-piece predecessor. Battery life is excellent. I frequently stream live video and have no problems. It is the ideal size and weight for travel and seems durable; I almost always take this on trips instead of the Mac. Admittedly it is not as flashy as a tablet, but it is much more functional for those who still want/need a physical keyboard and traditional computing capabilities in a very small package and don't want/need to pay three times more for an ultrabook.I have had the computer for five months, and I give it five stars. I would absolutely purchase it again with no regrets, especially for the price I paid (under $300). I hope, though, that Acer will address a few issues for future models. The speakers are shamefully poor. Though Acer hails the keyboard as full-size, this comes with a price: the keys are very close together (with maybe half the space between keys compared to a Mac) and very flat. (I found the smaller keyboard on the D250 preferable.) It takes a very long time for the machine to wake up after hibernation; perhaps that is a software problem? I don't care for the "water ripple" design on the lid (but really like the bottom, if not for those stickers . . .). Despite these issues, I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I was very excited to get a totally wireless headset, which I thought would be ideal for my workouts..

cycling and running
Here are the pros and cons of this product:Pros:- Easy setup


It was very easy to connect to my PC and drag and drop music files onto it- Comfortable
The adjustable headset is surprisingly light and fits comfortably
The dry vs
wet options along with the small/med/large sizes for the earbuds is great.- Quality: The unit looks and feels like a high quality item.- Sound: Music playback quality is decent.- Controls: Play / pause, volume up/down and track prev/next controls are easily accessed and used.- Waterproof: Great to know that this unit will hold up even in rain.Cons:- Not good for running: There's something about the design of the unit where every step you take translates to a very noticeable "thumping" sound

You have to crank the volume up to drown out the thumping vibration/sound.- Shuffle: Who knew that in this day and age that something as straightforward as music shuffle could be done so poorly! Basically, this unit does not truly shuffle your music; it simply plays them in random order without any memory of what it has already played


This means it will replay the same songs repeatedly before playing something new! Also, the unit suffers from a bug (shuffle would get stuck playing only a small subset of your songs), which required a new firmware download.Overall, I could not enjoy the unit since it failed to deliver my basic need..
shuffle my music! Fortunately, Jlab was very accommodating and is offering to let me trade this waterproof Go for another product.

$review_text.: I've always had mass-market cd players before, figured digital is digital, and never realized the difference that a higher quality player can make

 This Marantz is a revelation

 It brings my cds alive with a depth, vibrance, and clarity that I've never heard before


 It's also quite stylish, with the trademark Marantz curved edges


 The buttons on the front of the unit are a bit small and obscure, but I like the remote
 It's got excellent functionality and the buttons are nicely sized
 So far, my only quibble is that when you stop a cd in the middle it does not start back up at the same place, but goes all the way back to the beginning

 And the changer tray seems potentially delicate


 I'll keep my fingers crossed on that one
 Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

$review_text.: Although this keyboard is labeled "for android tablets," I think it ought to be a strong contender for any phone or iPad as well. Why? Because since it's made to be universal, it has a handy easel that props up any tablet or phone while your're typing then flips down to cover the keyboard when not in use. This makes it easy to stow in a backpack or other case for whenever you need to pull it out and use it, whether for tablet, phone, or iPad. I have an iPad, and I often found that the drawbacks of having a bulkier keyboard case always attached to my tablet often outweighed its convenience. With a separate keyboard with a built in easel, I think you get the best of both worlds.
$SUMMARY.: Great Keyboard for any tablet or phone

$review_text.: As noted by others, these cable covers are easy to cut, mount and use
They are very easy to open (used a flat head screwdriver) and easy to put your cable and power cord into

If not stuffed with more than two cords, they are easy to close too.Also as noted, the adhesive is strong..


so have your channel in the right place before removing the protective film or else you risk it getting stuck in some undesirable position and making a mess if you try to move it

The film was easy to pull off with the channel sitting right in the place we wanted to install it, so it should not be an issue if you do good prep work.The channels really look great in place! My only wishes would be: (1) Wish the channels were roomier as they max it one power cord and one cable or they won't close properly; (2) Wish that the T-junctions and corner elbow covers could be made a bit oversized..


I had to use a cable-splitter at a T junction, and had to run an small two-prong extension cord to an elbow, and both remain uncovered as the respective covers are just too small.All considered, good product that I would recommend.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this device for at least 6 months now and have been experiencing some annoying problems, now I feel compelled to share my experience and thoughts about this unit

The pros are pretty common knowledge and have been listed by many other reviewers, so I will not repeat them here


I'll just list the cons that I have not seen mentioned by anyone else
Some problems are just dangerous if you follow the instructions without double checking them.Cons:1) Out of date map data - I was looking for Blockbuster closest to my position, and it took me to one that was no longer there

Searching for a restaurant a friend had been going to for years returned no result.I was looking for a street in Chino, CA
But the C520 shows that are only 2 streets total available in that city
I checked the Tom Tom and Mapopolis on my PDA, and there are more than 2 streets in Chino, and I had the Tom Tom and Mapopolis prior to the Mio

Makes you wonder how out of date the map data on the C520 is.2) DANGEROUS INSTRUCTIONS - The device has told me to head into incoming traffic on Santa Monica Blvd

I was following the directions from W


LA to a pool hall in Hollywood
Following the instructions, I was on Santa Monica Blvd, it told me to make a left at an intersection, then make an immediate right into Santa Monica Blvd again


Looking at the highlighted directions on the unit, it wanted me to head into the other side of Santa Monica Blvd on the other side of the center divider, in other words, into incoming traffic

This happened to and from the pool hall

Good think I double checked before I followed its instructions.3) On road where you have to make a 360 degree turn, the instructions can be confusing, the best bet is to look at the highlighted road on the screen


For example, to get on the 57 South freeway in Placentia off Orangethorpe, I was supposed to get onramp on the right hand side, follow it for 360 degrees to get on, but the device verbally told me to make an sharp left, the arrow showed me to make a left


Another example was in Irvine, it told me to get off the 5 South, turn right, then get back on the 5 North


Turned out that I was supposed to turn 360 off the ramp, then follow the side road to my destination.4) Route recalculations for no darn reasons - I would be following the instructions to the teeth on a route that I know well, and all of a sudden, it would recalculate the route and give me the same route again

I double checked and I was on the route highlighted by the device, so why was it recalculating

This can be annoying, one time I was close to throwing it out the window.Overall, I still like this unit for many of its pros, and I hope someone will find this review helpful in making their purchasing decisions.I just noticed today that the addressing system seems to be off by 1/2 mile
 For example, search for the address at 3600 W Orangewood, 92868 on the C520 vs Google or Yahoo maps

 The first time I was looking for a POI here, I thought it had been moved and the POI was out of date


 Now, it makes me wonder if the other POI's which I thought were out of date were actually displayed off the mark by the C520, leading me to believe that the POI had moved.

$review_text.: This is a preliminary review. Fantastic. Clearly better range for non-ac clients. The previous wireless router was a Netgear WNDR 3800 dual band gigabit, which has generally been reliable. However, several sections of my house were very poorly covered with the r3800. Now, no problem. Crazy good stuff. This range improvement alone makes the purchase well worth it to me. It could be the better antennae (3 of them) but it's possible their &#34;Beamforming+&#34; technique works. (A good test would be if you could temporarily disable the beamforming function)Note: It is unlikely that the router will support large numbers of beamforming clients simultaneously (12?), and it is probable that non-beamforming clients will fall into radio &#34;shadows&#34; outside the &#34;beams&#34;. At the moment (early morning) the device is reporting only 8 wireless clients. All only using the 2.4GHz band.I'm also happy that I can disable WPS.Caveats: At the moment I'm only using this as a wireless access point. I have not configured it yet to replace the older router it is behind, so many router functions and extras are not in play. Also, I have only had it on and running for 2 days. I will update this review when I re-configure my network and start using it's full router capabilities.

But if you have the same taste as me and any of that stuff above agrees with you, the ATP-3 might too! Let's be real though, they don't sound better than my high-end Sennheisers.They don't CRANK super loud, but loud enough for me to step outside and go "hmmm, I didn't know I could hear it that well out here!"I've had these things for like 4+ years and they are going strong still


All the controls work just fine, no blown drivers, and my friends all like them.I wouldn't doubt the Klipsh Promedia 2.1 are better, and from the reviews they probably are
But then again these are $50 cheaper too :)

$REVIEW.: I bought this item and it worked fine with my Alpine

 However, it doesn't work as well as an adapter that has an iPod plug

 So I went to eBay and found a 5V adapter from a company called "deluxe-item" in Hong Kong
 This has both an iPod plug AND a regular stereo 1/8" mini


 The advantage of this setup is that you also hook this up to any 12v lead and ground which is activated by turning the ignition/acc on
 Thus, it also charges the iPod

 The quality was far better than I expected and it included an inline fuse

 The only downside is that shipping from Hong Kong takes a couple of weeks
 I paid $12.99 for the item

 I guess I'm one of the lucky ones that only had to turn the AUX on in the setup menu.

$review_text.: Perhaps everyone has their own criteria for a kindle cover
I just ordered my fourth kindle
The second and third were for family members and I held onto the old original kindle with a good folding cover
Now I have a new kindle! I put the new kindle in the old cover


That cover is beat up, frayed and looks well used


It protected my old kindle which has no screen scratches or damage from the years of use
Do you really want two separate items (cover and kindle) when you choose to read? Or do you want to simply fold the front cover over and start to read? Nothing awkward to fool with, or to find a place for or forget or lose
When you are done just fold the cover back and you are done
My experience has been that your kindle is most susceptible to damage when you are using it


Knocked off the table, fall out of your lap (don't fall asleep!) or a random grandchild attack
I will probably have to order a new cover eventually, but based upon experience, I would buy a folding cover.

$review_text.: The Lenovo S6000 on screen keyboard is big enough for the fattest of fingers, but anyone who can touch type and has more to write than a quick search term should treat themselves to this fine accessory.When not in use, the tablet and keyboard combine with magnets as a cover for each.  For typing, the tablet is held securely in a slot in the keyboard - in either portrait or landscape orientation.  When charged and turned on, the keyboard pairs easily to the tablet.The keyboard is the same size as the tablet and therefore quite a bit smaller than a standard PC keyboard, but I have no difficulty typing quickly and accurately.This keyboard turns the tablet into a laptop and I will use the duo when I travel, for checking E-mail and logging into my office network, rather than lug an actual laptop as I did for my last trip.  This works as well on my lap as at a table or desk for typing a quick note from my easy chair. I also recommend adding a Bluetooth mouse to complete the transformation.  Anyone who came from a PC background and got frustrated trying to edit text on a tablet, will surely welcome having a mouse pointer on their tablet screen.I have only had to charge the keyboard once so far and I've used it frequently since I got it a couple weeks ago.I could not be happier with this purchase and I highly recommend this product to anyone who has or is thinking about getting Lenovo's S6000 tablet.

$REVIEW.: This is, once again, one of those instances where I wish a 3 1/2 star rating was available.These ARE good phones and they do what they say they will in the product description... for the most part.I have NOT tried them on a plane and, living, as I am, in Florida, I don't ride the subway anymore. BUT...I have to be a bit skeptical about how much noise they would cut out in those milieus  as they are NOT (really) noise canceling.They DO, however, deliver a very good sound and, I would imagine they have more than enough versatility in volume control to OVER-RIDE much of that outside noise.Moreover the hinge design allows for easy carrying/storage in the provided pouch, while allowing for a full size, comfortable, over ear fit.And the 3-button control is convenient, instinctive, and easy to master quickly.The price is good without being astonishing, and offers value for dollarAll in all, not a bad choice, at all.I'D get another pair

$REVIEW.: AfterShot Pro  allows your images to be examined in work flows like they're on a conveyor belt. The software connects seamlessly to PaintShop Pro and PhotoShop and ACDSee, which is my picture editor.  You can edit your pictures with PaintShop which has powerful editing tools, then send them back to AfterShot. However, you can send your image from AfterShot to other photo editors in the reverse direction.This software has a great deal of flexibility.When you click the library file button  on the left all the files on your computer will appear in a menu. The selected thumbnails enter the desktop at the top and head south. AfterShop arranges the images in alphabetical order. You can append each image  with a one to five star rating or flag to remove. Clicking on a thumbnail will send it to the center of the canvas where you can work on it. A toggle button lets you change the size of the image.AfterShot Pro enables you to process a batch of images as a group, applying various adjustments such as file converting all at once. You can copy the image data that you select from one image and apply it to others. Virtually everything you do has at least one option, and you're allowed a legion of choices.The features of AfterShot Pro are arranged into three major parts: Manage, Enhance and Output.In MANAGE  you review, select and filter. With several very similar shots you can pick the best. This is a workflow tailored to your particular needs implemented by you.ENHANCE is a sophisticated group of tools located in menus on the right side of your canvas. "Perfect Choice" is a state of the art tool that optimizes the light, adjusts off-color tints and restores faded images, all with one click. The color adjustments include a stable of many options: A "pseudo fisheye" tool is one of my favorites as its effect is moderate and very pleasing. Other effects are:Crop, straighten, rotate and sharpen capabilitiesExposure adjustments, including color and tone modificationsHealing and cloning by removing an unwanted area or plowing it under with the clone toolReduction of noiseFill light for dark areasOUTPUTWith batch output you gather together your final shots, for a webpage, an album, a slide show and more.All of the steps and operations you select are carried out incredibly quickly. This software is functioning on steroids. Even your RAW images, which are like photo negatives, are quickly processed. AfterShot  is very comprehensive and after two days of use I know there are many nuances, steps and possibilities I have not yet  utilized. I particularly like the background black color of all Corel's software as images are enhanced against the dark color. Wherever you store your image folders, AfterShot will find them for you and pretty much will hold your hand as you tackle the many opportunities presented. AfterShot Pro is a very fine production and I am happy to give it five stars.

$REVIEW.: This case has a lot of reviews on it and it had most of the features I wanted so I picked it up.  The built quality seems pretty good and everything matches up pretty well.  My wife really hates certain noises and one of them is computer/fan noise.  I turned down all the fans in this case and it was still a bit too loud.  I tracked it down to the front case fan.  I never seem to have luck with noise and front case fans.  I bought a fan power adapter to bump the front case fan from 12v to 7v and the front case fan is whisper quiet now.  The rear case fan had a bit of a knocking noise to it.  I find most of the fans that come with cases aren't the best quality.  I replaced it with Yate Loon fan and I can't really hear it now.  The airflow on the case even with the fans kicked down to low is incredible.  With every fan on low I'm getting board and cpu temps of around 25-30C.  The claim about there being no filter's on the fans is a valid one as you'll pick up a ton of dust.  This doesn't bother me a ton though.

The hammock suspension system does what it was intended to do and adds additional safety to an already well constructed and well padded bag. I also like the water proof base (even though I would never set it in wet environment) that allows the bag to stand up for easy access.  The only negative is that I wish the shoulder padding was a little thicker and had a little better gripping material.  Still, was not enough for me to rate this any less than 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: Short story: I haven't found a better neoprene sleeve for my tablet.  Highly recommended.  (Fits iPad Mini, Kindle Fire HD, and Nexus 7)I'm really not a fan of neoprene sleeves.  I've avoided them largely because I thought they amounted to little more than a slip for your tablet device.  However, FRIEQ has made the first neoprene sleeve that I can really get behind.  This case is really, really cool.  The fabric is water-resistant (not water proof, please don't submerged this under 3 feet of water), and it feels good too.  Also on the exterior of the case is a small pocket for phones -- I was able to fit my iPhone and extra-wide Droid RAZR in this case comfortably, so I'm confident most smartphones will indeed fit inside.The interior of this case is covered in foamed bubbles.  These bubbles add really great protection for your device; if you carry this device in a bookbag, suitcase, or purse, the interior of this case will protection your tablet's screen from being smashed or cramped.  And if you drop it from most reasonable heights, your tablet will be fine.This case is considered &#34;grey,&#34; but as you can see in the image galleries, the exterior is largely pitch black.  The trimmings of the case (like the zipper) are grey, but for the most part, this case will seem black until you open it.  Once opened, there's nothing but grey.  And once you open this case, the niftiest feature of all is available.What this case offers that I don't think many others do is the built-in stand.  Once you unzip this case, there are two plastic flaps.  On first glance, you may wonder &#34;what are these for, exactly?&#34;  These flaps are used to prop your tablet up in portrait or landscape modes.  Because the sleeve's material is so flexible, you can position your tablet standing up (and the case props itself up) or lying horizontally.  It's a really great feature, and super handy.This case is large enough to support use for iPad Mini, Kindle Fire HD, or the Google Nexus 7.  This case fits the iPad Mini the best and most snugly, but it works well for the others too.  For the Kindle Fire HD (or Kindle Fire) and Nexus 7, there's a big more room, so the device may jostle around in the case if you really shake it.  For the most part, though, the interior bubbles will secure the tablet from any inner movements.Overall, this is among the best neoprene sleeves I've seen for any device (laptop, phone, tablet).  If you're looking for a nice neoprene case for your iPad Mini, Kindle Fire, or Nexus 7, I really recommend checking this out.  Disclaimer: This item was afforded to the review in return for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: I am a semi-professional photographer, and I understand that I cannot expect the same results from this as I get from the set up I use for work


Due the high cost of most dedicated cases ($500+ for our household camera, $2000+ for one of my work SLR's), we bought this camera solely for easy snapshots while kayaking at the lake

My expectations are not high for this sort of camera, and it manages to meet those expectations most of the time


 While it's great for the scrapbook shots,and perhaps printing 4x6's, expect to work harder and pay more attention to get some of those pictures.Pros:AA batteries


 I can't tell you how helpful this is, dealing with a proprietary battery out at the lake is an incredible pain in the neck.Simple button to turn off the flash
You need it with this camera, see the cons section.Simple button to adjust the exposure compensation.Large easy to see display


Even in the sun the display is easy to see.Splash proof - NOT waterproof
 One look at this thing and it's obvious it's going to take on water, too many exposed buttons.Small and rugged.Cons:Over exposes easily

 This camera will fire off the flash even in the slightest of shadows and as a result tends to make pictures a bit whited out.No lens cover

 Truly ridiculous, the camera is advertised for the water, why isn't there at least some kind of cheap cover to keep the water and fingerprints off the lens when your carrying it around?  The recessed lens makes it very difficult to clean the lens when it gets spots on it.Review time is fixed at 5 seconds

 Which means that you either have to shoot blind or wait those 5 seconds for the review to finish

 No buttons seem to make the camera kick back into the preview screen.No viewfinder


 I know this is the trend in most cameras, and I knew it didn't have one before ordering, but it really irritates the crap out of me.Factory float strap isn't a float strap
 I ordered the combo kit because it came with a float strap from the factory
 The assumption of course was that it would actually float the camera it came with, it doesn't

 Fortunately this is something I checked in a large bucket with an equal weight before going to the lake.Overall I would like to emphasize that this isn't too bad for a sub $70 camera


 If you want something that takes good pictures most every time, has a quick speed, is easy to get along with, and is water proof you need to at least move into the $200 range

 But if you don't expect too much you'll probably be satisfied.

$REVIEW.: This is a decent amp. It's build quality, though not great, seems better than the Lepai amp. My Lepai died within a year, this one is still going. Also, it seems to have more power ( headroom) than the Lepai. Here is the issue with all of these inexpensive amplifiers. At normal room volume they are operating at or near their extremes(clipping). As such, distortion values at normal listening levels are quite high. I recently replaced the Pyle with an ancient but high powered amp I had sitting down in the basement. The replacement amp was over 30 years old, and though no slouch when it was new, it is hardly considered to be anything other than entry level audiophile. Yet the sound of the amp was astounding. I think we have forgotten that high powered amps were developed for a reason. The reason being that lots if power is needed even a modest listening levels. We lavish our home theater systems with hundreds if not thousands of watts, but for plain old stereo we think 10 watts or so is enough. Anyway, I did not mean to get on a soap box here, and certainly do not want to be preachy. But when and if my old amp dies, I am replacing it with something in the hundred watt range.

$review_text.: I got this radio as a premium when my favorite PBS station was doing a fund-raiser. I wanted to be able listen to the HD stations and not use up bandwidth over my internet connection. Many in my area simulcast. The sound is OK, of course it has little bitty speakers, but it is bigger than I feared it would be for the price. It is about a foot long and half that tall. That is one aspect of on-line purchasing that I do not care for - you can't be very sure how big something is much of the time. I did kind of expect it to be slightly larger than palm sized. You do have to use either the included rod antenna, or connect it to another lead. As there are many HD stations in my area, there is a good variety of programs. Before you invest in any HD radio, I suggest that you become fairly confident that you are in range of the HD signal you want. I am pleased with this device, but I was not expecting very much, either.

Now I wonder if others were attempting to install pieces that were meant for round vs. square viewfinders.  Don't be scared of installation it was a piece of cake!I immediately fell in love with the Hoodsman.  I shoot lots of landscape shots and the ability to block out the light has tremendously improved my visibility on my subject matter.

The price is great, installation very easy, and it does the job I want it to do...even when I shoot in portrait orientation.

It did not take long before I noticed disconnections that required rebooting the modem.  I had my cable company check wiring and signal levels.  All of the connections checked out so I returned it as well.  I did buy another model Motorola modem however this one will forever leave me wary of their products altogether.

$review_text.: I purchased the NE-700x to replace my 5 yr old Shure E3 that had finally wore out.  I understand there will be a justified difference in quality considering the difference in price.  These were bought for my bike commute to work.Use - At first glance I thought they looked cool.  I like the plug on them, and liked the cable until I used them for a while.  The cable is not very pliable.  It wants to stay in the shape of the way it was packaged, and I found it awkward to wrap and store when not in use.  When unwrapping the cable was difficult to untangle.  This is a minor inconvenience.Sound - My first impression was good.  There is significantly more low end than the E3s and many other in-ears I have used, including E5s.  I enjoy the low end in most music I listen to so I did appreciate this however I found it incongruous that they would be marketed as "Audiophile-Grade."  These definitely color the low end.  The high end is clear and precise but seems lacking possibly due to the excited low end.  I would not use these for monitoring mixes, however they sounded great for my commute.Comfort - I found them a bit difficult to keep them in my ears.  The large sleeves were uncomfortable to me, and the triple flange lacked stability to be inserted consistently.  I used the medium sleeves.  I did not feel I could insert the earphones in deep enough to get a good tight fit that held itself in as I did with E3s.  They did feel very lightweight and comfortable when they were in, but I felt I was constantly adjusting them.The most unfortunate quality of the NE-700x is the build quality.  I have had them for about 5 weeks and the right side has stopped working.  I treat them relatively well and believe that this problem occurred because at work I walk with one earphone in, mainly the right.  Because of this the cable then gets the weight of the left on it and while I do wear the cable over my ear, this is the only conclusion I could come to.

$REVIEW.: Keep in mind Future-Purchaser, you might have to either solder on the leads or head to Radio Shack to get some female crimp on disconnects like here:[Ok, Amazon deleted my link but you can google "female crimp on quick disconnects"]...but then you still have to strip the wire and crimp on the new connectors....Unless your device already has these. I just wanted to mention that possibility to everyone.  On a scale of 1-10 it's a -1 though and you can buy either a soldering iron or a wire stripper for a few bucks and learn from a Youtube video.I bought this for a dust buster and I think most people that own that kind of device would be surprised that it may not be just a plug and play battery, but maybe on yours it is.Considering I solder it was a non-issue for me and the battery works great and was a great price!Thanks!

$REVIEW.: I've been using the 1TB 2 Big Triple for a few weeks now with my Mac Pro.Here are my initial impressions:The drive is very solidly constructed and comes with quality cables, a tool to remove the stand, a screwdriver to set the RAID mode switch, software disks and a power brick.It works well with Time Machine.In its default RAID 0 mode, it's fast


Using Firewire 800 it seems about the same speed as an internal drive to me.The removable drive trays were quite stuck at first, but after getting them out, they slide in and out OK

The finger slots don't give one good leverage to pull out the drive(s), so watch out for owies.Mine contains 2 Seagate 7200.10 500 GB hard drives that seem to run pretty warm and occasionally make loud clicking (seek) noises, even when idle


I have an older 7200.9 (in a generic enclosure) that does exactly the same things so it's probably not a cause for concern.Because the drives get very warm,  the temperature-controlled fan comes on and stays on after about 20 minutes

I think maybe installing some cooler-running drives would reduce this tendency to run warm.The tiny, recessed RAID mode switch requires the use of a small screwdriver (included) to turn


This is a good thing because moving the switch from one mode to another will destroy your data! One little thing: The mode switch on mine is slightly mis-marked as the JBOD position is actually midway between the JBOD and FAST markings.The "ON-AUTO-OFF" switch has been known to hiccup once or twice

It seems that "OFF" is not a "Hard" OFF, and sometimes acts like the "AUTO" position

Turning it "ON" then "OFF" seems to reset it OK.It's not perfect, but it's still my 2nd best external drive, the best one being my smaller and slower Lacie d2 Quadra 320.Have Fun,KeriUpdate: After removing the hot and noisy 512MB Seagate drives, I installed 2 WD Green Power 1TB drives for a total of 2TB in "FAST" (RAID0) mode


These drives are far better suited to the 2Big Triple as they run much quieter and so much cooler that the 2Big's cooling fan seldom comes on.

$review_text.: This camera delivers great picture quality and is very easy to use.If you are looking forward to editing and publishing your videos taken with this camera please note, at the time of North American release, software packages that can handle AVCHD digital format encoded using MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 (m2ts) are only starting to show up.The software included with this camera, Leadtools HD Writer Ver 1.0E for SD1, is capable of only basic operations such as scene preview, split, merge, and delete

Using this software you can backup your videos on a DVD-R disk, but you won't be able to play it back, unless you have one of the new Blu-ray disk players.The software situation will improve with time, and there will be more high definition video options in the future.To hookup this camera to a high definition display you can use provided component cables or the HDMI output (HDMI cable is not included)
Standard audio, video output is also available for older TV sets (cable included).The computer interface is USB (cable supplied); it works only when the camera is hooked up to the AC/DC adapter (included)
By the way, the battery will not charge inside the camera; charge it on the adapter disconnected from the camera.Videos and pictures are stored on an SDHC card (some SD cards can also be used, but SDHC class 2 or better are recommended)

A 4 GB SDHC card (one included) is good for about 40 minutes of recording in the highest quality HF setting; this is also about as much as the stock VW-VBG130 battery can handle
For more power on the go an optional VW-VH04 battery pack holder can be used

You can use additional SDHC cards, or dump data to a laptop computer via USB cable, or use optional VW-PT2 or similar SDHC media storage device.The battery is loaded from the bottom
When using the camera on a tripod, load the battery first.In addition to videos, this camera can also take still pictures


The quality of still pictures is so-so with some digital artifacts showing up; but it is fine for occasional snapshots
On the positive side, the still picture trigger on this camcorder functions like on real picture cameras: you can pre-focus depressing the trigger half way.Thanks to the powerful 3CCD sensor architecture and optical image stabilization the videos this camera takes are very good, even in sub-optimal light conditions

There is an automatic mode, and a manual mode for more advanced control
One of the features I especially like is the Grid that can be displayed for better shoot composition.HDC-SD1 is one of the first consumer high-definition cameras from Panasonic, it's a great start and sure to please customers looking so save the moving pictures of unforgettable moments in life.

$review_text.: If you don't transport your PC a lot and have a big enough case, this cooler really does stay quiet and keep things cool. Does great on my overclocked 3rd gen i7-3770k CPU. I did have to get low profile (LP) ram though. But I knew that when I bought it.I can't think of anything else to say. All I wanted was an air cooler that was super quiet even when running any overclocked CPU at 100% over a long period of time while also keeping the CPU temp at a max temp that is similar to a non-overclocked CPU. And this does just that.I've had it for over a year and no issues.The only bad thing I can think to say, is the cost when I bought it. But it's significantly lower cost now.
$SUMMARY.: Quiet and cool. Overclocking or not, this is a great cooler if you have the room.

 I always wanted a nice webcam

 This thing is great.

it's HD and widescreen


 I've used it to make Skype Calls to Europe and to New Zealand with no problem at all

 Of course, the call quality also has to do with your Internet connection


 The only improvement that I would make is to put a little shutter over the camera lens, a shutter that you can open and close so no hackers can peek in from time to time
 Right now, I stick one of those little yellow stickynote papers on the top of the camera and bend the paper over the lens

 Other than that it's perfect!  I could highly recommend this to anyone.

$REVIEW.: This camera is decent and has "OK" night vision.  I'm not blown away nor disappointed with this camera.  For my needs this wide angle camera works well.  I have much better cameras and some worse cameras so this one falls in the middle.  For the money it's about what I expected.  As all wide angle cameras, it is difficult to make out detail at any range.  The LEDs appear to be much brighter then some of the competition.  If I need another camera (of this caliber) I will probably get this one again.

I've noticed that it truly does help to keep the cords from getting tangled up.  These ear buds also come with an incredibly nice case that has 2 inner pockets.  Some ipod/mp3 players will fit in this case as well.  That would make a great bonus.With the option of 5 different plugs (2 different styles) that are included you are sure to find the perfect fit for any ear.  It took me 4 sets until I found the perfect fit for me & I love it.  They are comfortable & they aren't sliding out of my ear like the others were and like my other sets of ear buds do.  The ear buds are angled towards your ear canal, which helps to keep outside noise out and the sound coming out of your ear buds in.I highly recommend this item.

$review_text.: FYI: the power cables are CCA- AKA Copper clad aluminum which is about 3-4% copper and 96-97% aluminum
why is this important? CCA wires have the capacity of 65% of pure O2 free wires
that being said these wires arent terrible, and will work with many systems (def would not use it anywhere near 1600 watts)
fuse is 60 amps so about 720watts max for this kit at 12v i believe

The problem is that DB does not have this info on their packaging


this is the reason why I will give this product 2 stars

for all the 5 star reviews, I respect their opinions but I feel their rating will be misleading to new or inexperienced consumers


im using a mix of DB and rockford/sEFX wiring components and I like the RF and EFX way better than DB
unless you are very desperate and have limited funds or just don't feel like paying more, this amp kit will probably work for you if you a low powered amp.Pros:* Cheap* visually appears true to AWG specs (compared to my Rockford  4g and 8 gcable)* complete kit for a single ampCons* build quality is barely adequate* CCA will create more resistance+ heat and has a lower conductivity compared to higher end kits with pure copper* Misleading packaging and product info* Kit appears to contain other components in many other of the low cost kits from china

check amazon.com for their picks, all the wires and RCA cables are most likely made by the same company and repackaged.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this case!  It is exactly what I was looking for to fit my Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  It is a really bright red, which I love.  It is the only case that I found that gives me options for sitting the Kindle up and not having to worry about it falling.  When you use the magnetic cover to fold together and support the Kindle, it stays in place.  It also puts the Kindle to sleep and wakes it up with the magnetic clasp just like it is supposed to.  The cover also has a really nice, soft feel to it.  The cover also folds back flat if you want it to.  The Kindle fits snugly in the case and is held in by a velcro tab that slips in behind it; it is very secure.  And the soft interior of the case protects the surface of the Kindle.  You can still plug in the charging cord and reach all of the buttons, etc., without any problem.  I'm going to buy a couple more of these cases in other colors so I can change it out whenever I want.

$REVIEW.: I actually wanted a product that would keep my Raspberry Pi running without being connected to an outlet. Energizer offers some similar products, but this device from Anker had more power and was about HALF THE PRICE!The unit feels VERY solid. You charge the unit itself with a micro-USB. LED lights indicate the charging and charged status.There are TWO USB outputs - one optimized for Android phones and one for iPhone products. I didn't know there was a difference, but apparently this product adjusts to give you the fastest possible charging times for those two devices.And if you aren't charging an Android or iPhone? No worries. Should work with just about any device that charges off USB. There are multiple "tips" that can be used to charge your devices, although I only really need the micro USB. I bought this to work with my Raspberry Pi (small Linux computer), and it powers it no problem! So instead of having this Raspberry Pi device plugged into an outlet, I can move it around - and potentially develop mobile uses for it.Great product. Great build quality. 5 STARS.

$review_text.: I wish I could find one of these, with the same arm adjustments, for a SINGLE monitor

 As for this dual-monitor model...Things that could be improved:1
MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT: No individual height adjustment for each monitor

 The VESA mounts on my two monitors are located at different height levels, so one monitor is about 3 inches higher than the other
That's really annoying.2

As another reviewer had mentioned, when the monitors are pulled forward, the desktop stand version topples forward and right over super easily.3


The ball-and-socket portion could be stronger (stiffer)
Despite tightening the crank for this, it seems not sturdy enough for my monitor.4
Height adjustment should ideally be a hydraulic piston mechanism, like the mechanism used in most office chairs that let them be made higher or shorter
 The current mechanism involves a bracket with an open cylindrical center that slides over the mount's pole, and you move the bracket up and down to the desired height then take a tool to tighten the bracket super tight


It's WAY too hard to adjust the height with the current mechanism with two 27-inch monitors attached.

$review_text.: Minus one star for some of the blue light from the energy saver led bleeding over and out the socket plugs; I can't block that with electrical tape and this is in my bedroom so I don't want bright light.Minus another star for not having metric spacing between the mounting holes and making me redo my mounting screws. This sciency guy I know says that metric is superior to imperial and that we should all use that. He's from france so I'll take his word for it.Minus another star because the instruction manual is lacking in detail. No information about the relay or the current draw to turn the energy saver outlets on or off is given.The rotating plug seems useful, but I have seen shorts happen over time because it's a moving part, so whether or not this will occur in this remains to be seen.Plus one star because no other surge protector seems to have the automation features that this one has, although it is ironic that it is meant to save electricity from wasteful products, but yet it has FIVE LEDs on it that are always on when this is plugged in. I don't need that many LEDs to tell me that this thing is plugged in.Overall, a decent surge protector.

$REVIEW.: Updated 1-June-2014: I have four of these cards purchased in November, 2013; two in each of two identical Windows 8.1 computers. Lately, one of the computers was giving me BSODs once in a while. One of my WD MyBook 3.0 drives was again disconnecting and connecting repeatedly, but I am not sure why. In all fairness it could be the drive. Today, one of the cards has failed completely in the computer that was getting the BSODs. I read another review that this card was causing BSODs. Now, nothing plugged into it is recognized. So, by my luck of the draw, one in four has failed in six months. I have, therefore, lowered my rating to "It's OK." Fortunately, the other three have been operating perfectly so far.I bought two of these for a new computer for 2TB USB 3.0 hard drives. The drives transfer data about 5X faster than with the USB 2.0 card on my last computer. I order two more for another computer and after I had installed them both I found a small screw on the floor near the computer. It was from one of the new cards from where it holds the bracket to the board. The hole in the bracket was stripped so the screw would not stay in, so I found a slightly longer 6-32 screw in a box of hardware I have and it holds the bracket. The original screw is very short, tapered, and is self-tapping. When I first installed the cards, one of the WD MyBook HDDs kept disconnecting and connecting repeatedly. I installed the drivers from the driver disc that comes with each card and this seems to have corrected the problem. I like that the power connector adapter cable is included. Works with Windows 8.1.
$Helpful?.: [1, 1] $SUMMARY.: Works great. I advise to check the screws holding on the bracket for looseness. If they are tight, do not tighten them any more.

$review_text.: I bought this for my new HTC One V mobile phone from Virgin Mobile


 32GB is the max my phone is supposed to take, and this was the best price I found for a 32GB SD card
 You can get faster 32GB cards, but since my phone is set up for Class 2 or Class 4, why spend more money for a faster card than my phone can use?  I've had this card for a couple on months now, and I've had zero problems
 It works just fine, and it didn't cost that much, so it's another good deal on Amazon for me.Update 8 May 2014:  Amazon only lets you review a product one time, regardless of how many times you buy it


Fortunately, they let you buy it as much as you want, so I've now purchased 4 additional SanDisk 32GB microSD class 4 cards over the past 2 years


And each card has performed flawlessly


Two of them went into Nook HD and HD+ tablets, which allows my wife and me to run CyanogenMod Android as part of a dual boot system


(See [...] if you're looking for an excellent way to do this.) The others went into my wife's phone and our grandson's Chinese Android tablet


The Nook applications in particular are very demanding, and some other brands of memory cards simply don't work in Nooks -- but SanDisk cards have worked perfectly, and they have also worked perfectly in our phones and our grandson's tablet.Best card for the money

Buy it once, rely on it to work for a long time...and smile

It's as simple as that.

$review_text.: As suggested by some of the previous reviewers, I located and downloaded a program called "h2testw" to run against the memory card.  The card I purchased turns out to write at 8 MByte/s and read at 18 MByte/s.  So, it's faster than a Class 6, but slower than a Class 10.  Other than that, the card, adapter, and USB reader all seem to work fine.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's still a good value for me.  However, if I had bought this for a camera or something where I needed a true Class 10 card, I would've been really ticked off.

$REVIEW.: This little speaker impressed me right out of the box with its striking aesthetics


A black speaker grill is on front the length of the four inch speaker, set off by a silver and red insignia in the middle
On the bottom of the speaker are two rubber feet to keep the speaker from sliding about on a table
Corners are thoughtfully rounded; on back is an on/off switch and connecting slots.The speaker can be used cordlessly via Bluetooth (easily set up even by this Potato Head), or it can be connected to your device with the supplied cable
On top of the unit is a touch pad for volume or advancing songs
When the unit is not turned on, the top has an attractive glossy finish.But what about the sound? From one who's owned at least five brands of blue tooth speaker, I think the speaker's sound is quite good in ranges high to low


Playing the speaker much louder than I normally would, I was surprised at the lack of distortion and maintenance of clarity at high volume
I especially like using this speaker with my phone to get an instant speaker phone with good volume.In addition to the phone, I tested this speaker with my computer tablet and my laptop with good results
Listening to a movie while viewing it on my tablet was an enjoyable experience


Not owning an iphone, I brought this speaker to work so I could hear how it sounds through an iphone


Almost all of my students, it seems, have iphones so I asked one to try out this speaker

She was blown away by the excellent sound quality, expecting the tinny, muffled sound expected from a tiny speaker.The AYL speaker weighs about 8 ounces and measures approximately 4 inches long, two inches high, and two inches deep
It comes with two cables and a nice case


The owner's manual is minimal.

$REVIEW.: I spent a total of ($) for this monitor and it was well worth it.Last Christmas I spent ($) buying a 19" CRT monitor.  The picture quality was bad and of course it broke my back everytime I needed to move it around.  It was a piece of junk (btw it was a Sceptre monitor).Then in July after doing extensive research I settled on this Envision.  Sure they aren't a household name brand but people who used this monitor seemed for the most part satisfied.  The monitor was a breeze to install using drivers from the web-site and mine has zero dead pixels that I can see.  The default resolution of 1280X1024 is gorgeous, absolutely no flickering and the image is easy on my eyes.I don't see why anyone should buy a CRT monitor any longer.  I can't imagine any of the ($)LCD monitors being any better than this one.  The Envision also carrys a 3 year warranty so if anything does break...you're covered!This was a great buy and I have absolutely no regrets.  Some of the gripes people had was the awkward positioning of the buttons, lack of movement, small viewing angle, etc.  None of those problems bothered me and is negligible for this price!

$review_text.: Looks just like the carbon fiber leather interior trim of my car (from the factory)! Simply gorgeous & very easy to install, just tedious that's that

Fitment's very good


Don't freak out if the wrap around edge pieces won't stick at first
Do everything else THEN use the blow dryer for those pieces that won't stick


Only issue I had was when I was taking off (then re-installing) the area around the trackpad, the thin strip tore in half right above the trackpad but you can barely see it
Price isn't too bad especially since I don't have anything else to compare it too
I must've taken it off 5-7 times before getting it right yet it still clings on


I waited 2-days before using it to be on the safe side
I've heard customer service for the lifetime warranty's good so hope it's that way if I ever have issues
Overall, I'd rate it a 4.5 mainly due to the fact it's very tedious to install.BTW, there's no need to use the included spray (not sure why they included this) since it's just for the screen protector.

$review_text.: II have been using the keybard for roughly one week, and i am quite satisied with it.  The keyboard lauout (like all keyboards on laptops) are all a bit unique. Once you are used to the layout it works very well. The keys travel well with not a click, but with enough resistance that they feel satisfying. The spacing of keys is good, and fits my hands eally well.The keyboard took literally 2 months to pair on blueooth, and now pairs consistently. Highly recommended, and I would recommend to frieds.
$SUMMARY.: Great keyboard

$REVIEW.: I was excited to see this product when i got my ASUS router and bought too quickly before reading other reviews.  The antennas themselves are well made and screw directly on most wireless access points, but the performance gains negligible.  Honestly, the stock antennas I have with my ASUS wireless device were just as strong (signal ratio) or slightly stronger than these.  Don't waste your money on this, its all &#34;show&#34; and no &#34;go&#34;.....

$REVIEW.: I own several m4/3 bodies so I was able to try this on all of them.1. Oly Epl-1 works much better than the built in flash (duh) and also marginally better than the FL-14 flash . This goes the same for my Ep-3 body. This unit takes your set up from pen compact to big and ugly . Not quite a good match2. Lumix G5 .. Worked very well with this camera, with the exception of the petal hood for the stock 14-42 lens casting shadows when shooting subjects too close3. OMD-EM5 ..I could not get it to work properly. The flash foot did not fit in the shoe properly and would not fire properly. Additionally the E-TTL function was not working. Not sure of the problem so for not this is a fail on this body

Listening to music via itunes or musicbox is a pleasure. We use it for VoIP, and whether it is Skype or an offnet call, quality for the conversation is amazing. My dad has probelms with his ears and hears only about 50% on both of his ears, he loves this headset.I have been dropping it about a thousand times (need to get a hook on the shelve here), and it did not hurt the headset yet.Geat product, unbeatable price.

$review_text.: I have had a tomtom XL for years and it always worked flawlessly. I decided to upgrade for free lifetime maps and traffic. When I turned the unit on, it asked me to connect to my computer for updates. I did so and about 90 minutes later, it was ready to go. Or so I thought. It couldn't find my destination although my XL found it quickly. The START 55TM kept sending me around my block. I was finally able to plan a route by canceling the route in the unit. I took it with me on a 50 mile trip and it seemed OK at first. After about 15 miles the unit began to stutter. I was so startled that I began to laugh and almost became a statistic. When I got near my destination, it sent me to the wrong road and I had to ask for directions from a passerby.On the way back it ceased stuttering but the unit repeated all the directions twice. Then I noticed the map had flipped so the arrow representing the car always pointed toward me, easy to solve, I turned the unit upside down and made it home with no trouble. It left the task bar hard to read, though. I also could not get the traffic to activate even in a town or on an interstate. The manual suggested I needed an accessory. Support suggested that I did not. A further frustration was the lack of documentation. No instructions at all. The manual was slightly less helpful than not reading it at all because the content is muddled and confusing at best. The "manual" contains generalities and possibilities with few specifics so reading it is a waste of time.Too bad. I liked my other tomtom. I don't know what could have happened that the product deteriorated so. Unfortunately for me, my wife has taken possession of the XL, so I can't get it back.The only bright spot is that Melecia, at customer service is sharp and efficient. She answered my questions and gave me helpful information. She worked with me professionally, and politely to solve my situation.Tomtom, please take notice.Update 6/24/2013Made several calls to Tomtom support and Enid and April (at Tomtom support) appear to have straightened out the problems. I took two short trips and the unit worked well. So, to be fair, I have raised my rating to four stars only because it seems a little slow in picking up satellites and because it seems to have a tendency to revert to the route planning screen. A touch brings it back to "normal". I deliberately chose a different route than the unit had provided and there was a little confusion before it straightened itself out. During that time the unit kept insisting that I make a U-turn even though I was only a mile from my destination. When I used the POI to set a destination it also told me I had arrived even though I was still about a quarter mile away from my destination. The traffic feature appears to be working but I will need to test it on a longer trip. All in all, not a bad deal for the price. There are a lot of features packed into the unit. It also gives you a lot of information. Through use of the overlays you can obtain even more information about a needed destination quickly. One thing is a must. Create a account with Tomtom home. Create a back up and update it. That may save a lot of grief down the road. Demonstrations of features are also available from the home page.Update 7/7/13Just returned from Gettysburg. The way out of the reenactment battlefield was blocked off by police. The START 55 took me around the blocked off areas, through developments, little used roads and back roads until it got me back to the main highway. It even picked out a restaurant that turned out to be both good and inexpensive. I warned me of traffic problems 6 to 7 miles ahead and indicated whether or not I needed to pick an alternate route. I'm impressed...... Gave my old TOMTOM (XL335)  to my wife. It still works flawlessly after almost 10 years. I only gave it a 4 star rating because it mispronounces the names of some roads and there is no way to "lock" the unit. Another GREAT DEAL from TOMTOM and AMAZON. Another tip of the hat to Amazon customer service who straightened the unit and me out.

$REVIEW.: This radio came packaged well. Each radio was in a box of its own, and then one small size box that contained both radio's. The radio is small, hand held not as big as the picture looks.The radios were needed so that we can be aware when we are portable and stay aware of the weather at all times.These will make an addition to our car kit and home kit. We have table top weather radio's but wanted one for the car and a handheld for home that also has AM/FM as well as NOAA. We have the Midland pocket weather alert radio handheld but that one only has NOAA. We also wanted to save on batteries and this radio has a crank, solar charge which will keep us from searching for batteries.We also wanted a way to charge our cell phones. We have the Midland Base camp two way radio with emergency Crank power as a base unit as well. This radio can also charge one cell phone at a time. This radio stays at home as well.We have the Sangean table top which is awesome! That unit stays at home at all times. The Ambient weather will give us portable emergency radio. The Midland handheld radio runs on battery and no crank. So we wanted the Ambient weather radio as a back up radio as well as portable, car and home kit.So far this radio sounds as good as our table top. So far we are happy with this radio. We paid $69.99 for this 2 package deal so that we would have two.This is a great buy at the price we paid for two radios. This will make a great addition to any home.Always keep any eye and ear open for what is going on with the weather. Enjoy!

$review_text.: These earphones are the best I ever had


I never had to try other pairs of earphone because I absolutely loved these that I keep buying it! After 6 years I buy the same one everytime


Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money
It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening


It's actually static electricity
I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form
It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked
The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones
Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model
I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.

$review_text.: Bought this for my Asus 300T.  For the money, this case can't be beat.  It's a very slim case, and when closed it looks just like a little black book.  The two viewing angles are just fine.  There is no portrait mode angle.  It's easy to slip the tablet in and out of the case, for when you don't need that much protection, and it only takes a few seconds to do so.  There are magnets in the cover to hold it closed.  There's also a little stylus holder on the side, and some business card holders built into the inside of the cover.The only think I don't understand are the two semi-circles above the business card holder.  I can't figure out what they are there for.  Anyone?UPDATE 04/18/13.  The case has stretched so badly that it's unusable.  The flap that holds the tablet into the case no longer positions the tablet so that the usable sections are not obscured.  Nothing lines up any more.  The opening around the power connection has frayed.  Trying to use an HDMI cable while the tablet is in the case is a giant pain.  I guess for the money and the amount of time I got out of it, it wasn't a horrible deal.  Even with a three year warranty I'm not returning it.  Better cases are out there now.

$review_text.: I ordered the keyboard/mouse/bluetooth combo but it proved to be a scam so I can only review the keyboard. Sorry if people need more info about the other two.The keyboard is full sized and the display is monochrome, but it's functional and if you can find and install apps for it I'm sure it could be really useful. The media buttons are oddly located but once you get used to them it actually makes a decent amount of sense where they placed 'em. Keys are springy without being hard to press, and the thing seems decently made though I wouldn't reccommend throwing it after losing in a game or something. The bluetooth part works (I already had a reciever, and it's a piece of poodoo but this thing connected easily so bonus) and that's about all I can say about that.Overall it's a decent keyboard. It's not what I'd call a primary board for a serious user, but if you're just surfing the net, watching movies, or whatever, it'd be fine. Then again I use my keyboard so much (Saitek Cyborg) that I've worn the chrome off the keys, worn a ditch in the frame where my thumb rests, and this is the second one I've done that too lol.

$REVIEW.: Verbatim use to be the very best when using either the - or +  format,  or, Verbatim +RW  and dual layer discs


 But in very recent production Verbatim moved their Taiwan quality product to now India and Singapore, China and for the first time they undermined their quality controls for reliability over producing a less reliable, cheaper product


 Therefore, I know that Sony also has good over all quality products and to a point, want quality control


 The rich AZO dyes are important when recording on DVD recorders which perform better at lower speeds (X2  X4  X 8  )  for the stand alone DVD recorders


 The worst thing folks can do is buy store bought 16X  discs for stand alone DVD recorders

 Now Im sure that computers with DVD recording can keep up with the faster speed discs, but only computers


 Stand alone DVD recorders fair far better the lower the number of spins when trying to capture live TV shows and events
 Sony packaging for these discs are vague on country of origin
 But once tested, they did perform well and do have the same rich AZO dyes needed for archiving and recording 


 These are given a thumbs up,  and the price is right.

I have never needed a larger one in all my location portrait shoots. I did find the stand a bit flimsy. In fact I rarely use it. I often times just prop the reflector in place or hand a friend hold it. If it's even just a little bit windy, the thing acts like a sail and no stand will hold it.

I couldn't hear anything around me, not my sister's dvd player, or the radio at full volume. I had these at about half volume. I am even using them right now. I have an unusually clacky keyboard, and can't hear it at all with these on. The almost around ear design really does work, in that I can hear almost no background noise compared with my old iPod earbuds. I threw those out after about 10 minutes using these. My dad has the bose on-ear headphones, and I used those on the drive out. Those don't even match up to the sound quality these sony headphones have. Plus, these have a much larger volume range. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.

It fits my ipad Air very good, it's nice and snuggly.:)The only reason I'm giving it a 4star is Bc I have the beats headphones and the headphone whole on the case doesn't allow me to insert the jack... So I have to remove that corner or flip it back while I'm using my headphones. Other than that I love it. The color is bright and makes me happy:).i use my ipad a lot and it feels when I hold it, very we'll made case. I'm happy with my product. I would buy another if they make the whole bigger or fix it so my beats headphones fit. Thank u!

$REVIEW.: I just received this from Amazon.com

 These are my initial impressions.1
It takes 16 hours for the first charge of the batteries, so don't plan on using them the first day you receive it.2
I was disappointed by the loud hum/hiss you hear during periods of silence
 I really didn't notice it when music was playing (or while watching movies), but there was quite a roar after the song ended (MP3s playing on a HTPC)

 I played around with positioning of the transmitter, but it didn't seem to matter

 I also tried changing the headphone channel to no avail..

at least not at first


 I just started playing around with the channel switch again and it did seem to help quite a bit.3


The range is SUPER!  My HTPC is in the basement on one side of the house and my bedroom is upstairs on the other side of the house..
very good reception even at that distance

 My Linksys wireless router can't even work that far

I can go anywhere in the house.4

The headphones are very comfortable and VERY good at isolating you from  virtually all room noise..
even with my son cranking up the 12" subwoofer during videogaming

 My wife thinks they'll be great for isolating her from the household din even when the headphones are turned off.5
If you want an extra set of headphones to use with this system, you might as well just buy another complete package..


the additional headphones without the transmitter is only about $15 cheaper.Summary:  I really like it, but wish there was NO hum/hiss (probably unrealistic to expect this from wireless)


 Excellent range, great noise isolation, great sound, great comfort
 A keeper!

$REVIEW.: Out of all the case fan in the market today, Noctua is the only company that stands out.At first glance and touch, you can tell this is not some cheaply made computer fan. There are actually some weight in the motor and quality ABS plastics. This is the only brand I will ever buy for case fan now. The extra cost is totally worth it with an unbeatable 6 years warranty!Pros:1. Quality2. A lot of airflow without the noise or vibration3. 6 years Warranty!Cons:1.

$review_text.: I had this mouse for several months and can say I enjoyed it immensely.  It was my first gaming mouse although I've gamed for many years.  Let me boil down this review into three main points:1. The MX518 is a good quality mouse that is very versatile2. The MX518 is a one of my two favorite mouses for under-$60 but just satisfactory if you have more funds or want a hardcore gaming mouse3. The MX518 could use several tweaks but remains a classic gaming mouse1: The mouse held up very well to continual all-day use in an office-type environment for twelve hours straight, seven months before it was ever used for gaming and the only wear was the silver logitech sign was a little faded and the plastic gloss peeled up a little in the area around the wheel and dpi switchers.  I must say it worked very well for many gaming applications of a very diverse group.  I could be playing a face-paced shooter one moment, a turn-based strategy game the next, and a combat flight simulator the next and never did I feel the mouse was under-performing or out of place.  A simple click of the dpi buttons was the most I ever had to do to get into "gear" for a different genre game.BONUS: If you are a real time strategy gamer, this mouse's dpi switching buttons are so easy to access and change that micromanaging units or quickly selecting large areas are made enormously easy in a matter of microseconds.2: This is a great mouse for people who are just beginning to get into serious gaming or those who just want to step up their game a little without spending a ton of money.  The mouse is serious enough and delivers enough extras to make gaming easier and more comfortable without an enormous price tag.  The only other mouses I've seen to do that are theMicrosoft SideWinder X3 Mouseand theMicrosoft SideWinder X5 Mouseand the MX518 is a lot closer to the Sidewinder X5 in terms of performance.For those who are already hardcore gamers I would suggest theMicrosoft SideWinder Gaming MouseorLogitech G9X Laser Mouse.  For those who are looking to jump in head first into gaming mice but don't want to go to hardcore all at once, I would suggest theLogitech Gaming Mouse G500 (Black/Silver),Razer Lachesis 4000 dpi Laser Gaming Mous--Banshee Blueor the truly classic but slightly datedLogitech G5 Laser Mouse (Blue/Black).3: My gripes with this mouse are that the 'back' and 'forward' buttons on the left side of the mouse were sometimes a little awkward to push depending on your gaming posture.  Another issues was the ring finger and pinkie placement (for right-handed users) on the mouse sometimes caused the pinkie to be dragged around uncomfortably.  With time the cord also seemed to get a little worn.  Finally, if one gamed for over a couple hours the logitech symbol would be branded into one's palm for a short period of time afterwards.Even with all these issues, I must give the MX 518 it's due respect and say it is a great mouse for many gamers and enthusiasts alike.
$SUMMARY.: Very Good Mouse, Great if you have less than $60

$REVIEW.: I tried the Dual and other bluetooth connected hardware with limited success.When I saw that Garmin had an iPad map app thatstored the maps on the iPad - I investigated further tofind out that they also sold a GPS hardware unit that connectedto the iPad via bluetooth.  Not only worked great withtheir app - but worked with the other iPad mapping appsI had (TomTom, Google Maps-before Apple erased it).Called them for support for initial ipad connection issue -turns out - for me anyway - you need to disconnect the bluetooth (if you tried it)and restart the iPad (hold down both buttons until you see the Apple)and then reconnect the bluetooth.Great product - turn-by-turn directions on my WiFi-only iPads (2 & 3)Would recommend.

$REVIEW.: Positives:-USB 3.0 compliant (can connect to USB 2.0 port).-VERY small and portable.-Impressively large storage size.Negatives:-Short USB 3.0 to USB 2.0 connection cable (the only cable it comes with)
It's about 1.5 feet long


Shorter cable = more portability though.-Piece that connects the cable to the hard drive is shaky and unstable
No issues yet though.-Entirely black, so you see every speck of dust known to humankind that gets on it

Not a performance issue though.Overall, a pretty good buy for the price

I'm worried about the instability of the adapter piece that connects the cable to the hard drive, it can almost come completely loose if jostled enough


Not sure what Seagate was thinking with the adapter, but everything else is nice


The cable could've been a bit longer, but that's just nitpicking.

$REVIEW.: Honestly with little effort, my photos look like a professional took them! I will never, ever own a point-and-shoot camera again! My son started soccer and I would pull the old iPhone out and snap a few shots. They were horrible!! I know, it is not fair to compare an iPhone to an DSLR. I have a Canon point-and-shoot as well, but it isn't that much better. I have no clue how to use most of the features, but what little I do know seems to be enough. It is super easy to use. And the fact that it takes quick shots keeps me from having to wait for the camera to decide when it will take the picture. I'm able to catch great moments quickly. I recommend this camera for anyone frustrated with their point-and-shoot but don't have any plans to become a professional. The camera is reasonibly priced and worth every dime!

$REVIEW.: Fits fine.  I originally thought that the little flap by the keyboard was going to be too annoying, but it's really not too bad.  Ideally, I would have liked a thin plastic case, one that folded up easily under the unit when not needed.  But, I guess you can't bee too picky with Android devices.  The keyboard works fine, but sometimes seems to take a couple taps before in kicks in.  Also, I am sure the Bluetooth usage on the tablet drains the power faster.  My biggest complaint is that when you fold the keyboard out of the way, the unit is sort of awkward to hold.  The ability to stand is nice though.

$REVIEW.: I've seen this exact item on amazon under a couple different brands, at the same price. this was the only one sold directly by amazon, so...have worn these headphones for hours at a time watching tv or movies, not the most elegant design but no pain or discomfort.I like that the fwd/back buttons already worked as +/- 10seconds in my video player, and the big main button worked as pause/play, all by default, no setup required from me.nice that it can be charged while in use (obviously you'll need a much longer cable than the 3' one that comes with it. wish it was micro usb rather than mini - I don't mind needing a different cable than my phone etc. use, but micro is much sturdier (far greater number of duty cycles than mini, for one thing)battery life seems good and it also seems to charge fairly quickly.sound can get a bit muddy, have to turn up the volume sometimes to be able to hear voices in tv+movies. sometimes there are artifacts (low bass pops) that are definitely only happening on the headset, but not when using my tv speakers. also, with some videos, the audio gets out of sync 0.5-1sec (but almost always off by a constant amount, so at least it can be fixed just-once in the video player, and not have to keep messing with it throughout a movie) - but again, as soon as I switch back to tv speakers, the audio sync is not off.price could be a little lower for what it is, but I am satisfied so far.

$REVIEW.: I bought this because I wanted the best Radeon I could get that was low profile so it would fit in my HTPC and passively cooled, so it wouldn't be any louder than it already is. The card works great. It replaced a Radeon HD 5450 and I've gone from playing Batman: Arkham Asylum with high detail at 1280x720 at 36 fps (with an 11 fps floor) to playing with very high details at 1920x1080 at 40 fps (with a 24 fps floor). My old card was serviceable, but this one is really good. I do have one complaint though: the heat ssink is huge. I had to remove some sort of wire support structure to be able to close my case back up and I doubt I can use the PCI-e 1x slot next to my graphics slot now.

The included calibration mic is also really helpful, and the unit has many other useful features.  The internet connectivity is a great feature, and I can listen to Pandora without having to hook up and turn on some other device.  Being able to update the firmware over the internet allows fixes and changes to be implemented; however the first firmware upgrade wasn't easy, since the feature that didn't work properly was internet connectivity itself.  The tech support guy I spoke to seemed a bit grouchy, but he was able to help nonetheless.After getting it I discovered (through reading) that analog inputs are not played back through digital outputs. That feature is available in higher-level units in the line, but I haven't actually needed that feature yet.  There's also a really noticeable delay when switching inputs that I wish was shorter, but I gather that it's somewhat normal for consumer digital video hardware that doesn't have a high price tag.Overall, the unit is really good (but not perfect), and I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I recommended this unit to friends when I first got it a year and a half ago, but I don't really know what's current any more.

$review_text.: My KT lighted cover arrived last night...  Given some of the other reviews, I was expecting not to like it...  I was pleasantly surprised...  Although not as substantial as the cover for the keyboard Kindle, I think this cover is better in some respects.  In my opinion, this cover and KT form together so well that it feels more like reading an actual book.  I like how thin it is and am very happy with the product.  The only criticism I have is that I would have liked the product to incorporate the band closure available on keyboard version.

$review_text.: This 3.5" to 5.25" Drive Bay Computer Case Adapter Mounting Bracket is very nice. It's strong made of metal except for the front bezel which is why I gave it four stars instead of five that and because the front bezel didn't connect perfectly to the metal base however it was nothing a drop on each inside of gorilla glue couldn't solve. All in all it's fine and looks elegant in my PC box. For the price you can't find anything better.

$REVIEW.: Well padded sleeve protects the netbook. The zipped pocket on the outside is large enough to fit my external DVD/CD drive. It has a wrist strap, but I wouldn't recommend carrying your netbook by this strap. I believe it is designed to give you added protection while holding the sleeve (in case it gets knocked out of your hand). I am not sure how long the wrist strap would last if you carried your netbook only using it.Great value for the money.

$review_text.: Received this light and plugged it into a 12v power source.  Turned on, very bright.  Nice, right?  Nope.  Put it back in the box to bring to my truck.  Took it back out of the box, plugged it into the cig lighter (to test it out, was planning on hard wiring it ultimately) and it didn't work.  Would not turn on.  The wire coming out of the light itself seemed really loose and had about 2&#34; of play, obviously there was a bad connection inside the light box itself.  So not happy with the quality wiring-wise.I would like to comment on build quality and design though.  The reflector setup is built very well, all metal design and the light housing is also very sturdy.  While the pivot point is held in place with two nuts which can be tightened once in position (but can easily come loose), it gives the user options in regard to mounting position.  The light head can be pointed outward so when stuck on a slanted front windshield, the light goes straight ahead.  However the light head can also be rotated, meaning that it can be mounted to the vertical rear glass of a pickup and the light head points straight out the back.  It's great, although I've never had good luck with simple suction cup mounted accessories, so I imagine a permanent bracket would need to be made for permanent mounting.  Longer cord would probably be nicer too, although hardwiring is always an easy option.

$REVIEW.: I just bought my fifth iPod (unfortunately last one was stolen from my car). The sixth generation has so many stupid "features" with no benefits (who needs cover flow?) that it has lost all of the simple FUNCTIONAL excellence that has been the hallmark of Apple since I bought my 128K Mac.Here are the basics - good memory option, 80GB is more than enough for a few movies to watch on the plane, all your music, and more photos than anyone really wants to see. Also smaller and lighter than previous iPods (but if you are using it to run (primarily) the nano is the way to go)Here are the negatives - the click wheel works sporadically (a disaster if you are trying to adjust the volume while exercising - end up skipping songs) Launching and scrolling takes noticeably longer - even when the click wheel is working. All the games you bought for your previous iPods will probably not work. Syncing also seems to be more problematic. I have hung up on several occassions (approximately 30% of the time). When it hangs there is nothing you can do but power down. You can't force quit, you can't shut down.Recommendation - get a fifth generation off of eBay until Apple returns to its roots - marketing software and hardware that works instead of rushing products to market and letting the user community find all the bugs in the bloated software that they were too lazy to find and/or fix.

$REVIEW.: I bought this tripod as part of a &#34;bundle&#34; ; don't know how Amazon's product-review algorithms work, but I prefer to leave my feedback for *individual* items. Fairer that way.  My comments on this individual item:If you have been suffering with a cheap-o aluminum tripod that reverberates for 1/2-second after a light bump:1) BUY this model NOW if you shoot with any rig &#60;13lbs (yeah - I know, it's only rated for 11Lbs,). Any head will work - Manfretto 496/98 light ballheads good - your choice for needs/wants. I say aluminum, you say magnesium.2) Fit and finish are EXCELLENT, operation simple3) Do not pay more than $250 &#34;net value.&#34; Wait for deals - you're reading this, so you must be serious about value/utility.4) Go Carbon Fiber/Magnesium. Aluminum/plastic is inferior for capturing images.Longevity? - time will tell. I *just* got it.I'm still knocking myself in the head for desiring/purchasing&#34;better&#34; lenses/equipment that sorely needed &#34;proper support.&#34;If you are looking for better images and struggling with vibrations, drop a few hundred $ on a proper support platform. You won't be sorry.This is a &#34;mid-range&#34; tripod with &#34;pro&#34; features. I recommend it highly so far. Light, sturdy, fits in 27&#34; case- with smaller ball head attached. It *does* adjust down to 8cm above-ground camera height (attested) - a budding Macro-ist's delight.

$REVIEW.: I'm very happy with the purchase, but you need to sacrifice something to get the extended battery life (for a good price).My Canon video camera does not &#34;recognize&#34; the battery pack.  What that means is you can operate the camera for a long time with these batteries, and they can be charged like normal as well.  What you get for it is each time you turn the camera, you might get a message saying &#34;camera does not recognize battery pack, continue using?&#34; and you will have to hit &#34;yes.&#34;  Because the camera does not recognize the battery, it cannot tell you how much battery life you have or how much time you have left.  I'd rather not know how much time I have left and have a large capacity than have a small battery and know how much time I have before it dies.  That's why you have 2 battery packs.  Keep both charged.  One in the camera and put the other in your camera bag.  Even if it runs out, you've got a spare.I'm very happy with the purchase.

 Obviously, it is a refurbished CPU, so mine came with a broken front panel connector, but all the other connectors are holding it in place, the back accessory plate was missing, the video output was missing a screw and after I installed my Panda, it found two Trojan Viruses on the hard drive


 But all in all, a very good deal and all the things I had were / are minor and don't rise to the level of returning it or anything like that
 Works well, faster speed and mine actually had 2.5GB DDR2 Memory


 Nice sized case and can be placed up or down with your monitor on it
 The shipping box was marked "fragile", but apparently the carrier didn't understand what that meant


 Luckily the CPU was very well wrapped / packaged


 Overall, three thumbs up.

$REVIEW.: Now... this is what I'm talking about :)Mint produced a beautifully designed and crafted sound bar that's easy to set up and operate and delivers sufficiently good sound to make a good pick when used with a flat screen TV and some Blu/DVD or some media player. Granted, it's not a Hi-Fi system but it's 2.1 stereo does a credible job at simulating surround and, for as long as you don't have too many things to attach to it, you are not going to need a dedicated receiver.WHAT YOU GETYou actually get a lot for the money.- The main unit, an elegantly polished thin sound blade with the right/left speakers clusters in front, I/O and controls in the back.- Subwoofer. It's wireless in the sense that you don't physically connect it to the blade but you still need to plug it into some power source.- Remote control.- Wall mount brackets.- Cradle stands if you'd rather have the blade sitting on a shelf.- Wall mount template.- HDMI cable.- Power cords and DC power supply.- Well-written manual.And everything is well packaged inside a thick, protective Styrofoam shell.INPUT/OUTPUT AND CONTROLSI was surprised to notice quite a lot of I/O ports. You ARE limited to only 2 HDMI connections but... there's more. Here is the I/O.- Line In round jack, to be used mainly with a portable audio player.- S/PDIF input jack which, I am told, works with digital optical audio devices.- HDMI inputs, there's TWO of these.- HDMI output, only one.As for controls which, by the way, are replicated on the remote:- Woofer on/off- Mode - cycle between TV, music, movie, surround or news.- Input selects the active input- Power on/off- Vol+/Vol-- MuteAll simple and efficient.I didn't do the wall mount myself but setting it up to sit on a shelf was a matter of about 10 minutes.And... this is just about it. The subwoofer was already paired to the blade so my entire unpacking, setup and getting to know the product took something like 30 minutes but I didn't rush.My impressions so far are of 'good value' considering what this is selling for. I like the understated design, the space-saving form and the ease of setting it all up and then enjoying it. For anyone not looking for a 'high end', over-versatile, super-sophisticated sound solution, this should be it. We've set ours in the basement and the kids who are using it mainly with a gaming console are overjoyed.

I updated it from the gopro website before trying anything else
I had great success for about 3 weeks and then it would sometimes not turn on at all

I re-updated the camera but still no success

I contacted GoPro and they took 4 days to respond


I was sent an automated email response with basic troubleshooting techniques

The email was useless
It then took a week for me to hear back from them

They said it was a faulty unit and they would replace it with a refurbished one

I returned it to Best Buy and got a new one.My second one works but is still not perfect
Wifi is intermittent

Hopefully they work out all the bugs.Pros:-Price-Built-in wifi + free iphone app = easy to set up and control-Video is superb quality-Sound is surprisingly good even in the waterproof housing-There are SOOO many mounts availableCons:-Wireless works for only about 30 feet outdoors-The app has roughly a 5 second lag-VERY poor video quality in low light-Wifi is unbelievably unstable


Works only sometimes.-WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PLANET!

$review_text.: I have owned several Panasonic Lumix cameras in the last 10 years, upgrading periodically when new feature(s) make it economical to buy newer models.  I still use my FZ50 professionally, upgraded from an FZ20 to a 35 to the 50.  Wanting a point-and-shoot, but something more than snaps, for my personal life, I went to the Lumix.  The ZS series has been excellent.  For personal work, I don't want to spend a lot of time setting up shots, and I'm more likely to want quick reaction to capture a fleeting moment or motion.  No point-and-shoot (p&s) will be excellent at that, but that doesn't mean I can't get one that does well in a majority of situations.  My Lumix ZS3 performed exceptionally well for a p&s, and the ZS7 did even better.  So looking over the specs of the ZS10, I decided to buy one.  While I rarely use the video feature (I was raised on still photography!), much improved in this model, I wanted quality for stills.  16X zoom (to 21 with some kind of electronic extender option) up from 12X, and 14.1 megapixels up from 12.1.  Improved antishake (at my age it's very useful), and GPS (which eats battery, can be turned off, but is occasionally useful for verifying sources), and other software I will continue to try out.  So far so good, with crisp photos in most situations.  Still is only good, not great, in low light; is better at eliminating motion blur (CMOS instead of CCD), and the easy menu help make this a worthy upgrade.  Flash is still basic minimal (about 8 feet), typical of a p&s.  Uses the same battery as the ZS3, so didn't have to buy new ones.  Mini-USB plug (at camera) to standard USB plug is also typical.  I invested in SanDisk Ultra cards (Class 6), and they work well.  My 8 Gb says it will take 2800 pictures at 12.1 Mp.  I don't think I'll ever reach that number, preferring to upload to my computer regularly, but it's nice to have spare capacity.  The ZS10 has an SDXC host software, so can take the new BIG cards (48 and 64 Gb), but their high cost makes them uneconomical currently for me.  Still, nice to have the capability (NOTE: lots of cautions say NOT to put an SDXC card in an SD/SDHC camera that DOES NOT have an SDXC host software).  So instead bought a moderately expensive Extreme Pro SDHC (Class 10) 32 Gb card, and in this camera the irritating lag between pictures (typical in nearly all electronic cameras) was shortened noticeably.  That's nice!  The ZS10 will run SD, SDHC, and SDXC, so my legacy cards are still fine.  From a first day testing perspective, the ZS10 has shown its mettle, an improvement (significant, if not huge) over the ZS3, and in most situations where a personal camera is useful, takes excellent pictures, and has a reasonably useable menu.  I like my blue one.

 The reason?  because they were no longer holding a charge!  Dumb I know

 But, this time I thought why not just try some batteries?  So, off to Amazon I went and found these


 Ordered 4 of them to go in my 4-pack of Uniden phones I got at Costco as described above


 Charged them over night and guess what?  THEY HOLD A CHARGE AGAIN!  Serious, that easy

$REVIEW.: These ear plugs work very well at reducing the sound level without reducing the audio quality.I was lucky enough to try these at a local concert where I was standing close to a speaker stack.  In the past, I used rubber ear plugs or just paper napkins to deaden the sound.  These do the same thing, but allow nearly the full frequency range to pass through, just a lower level.  Regular ear plugs lower the volume, but also deaden the sound.  I liken it to turning down the volume on your headphones.  Sure, when they are turned up you hear things that might not be heard when the volume is turned down, but if you don't want your ears ringing in the morning, these are for you.Worth the very reasonable price of admission.
$review_summary.: Enjoy the head-banging, without the ear-ringing.

$REVIEW.: Sure, if this techie pebble worked, it'd be awesome.  But it doesn't. Don't get me wrong, it TRIES, but it fails.I installed it properly, and it has uploaded maybe 10 photos to my computer so far, out of a couple hundred.  It always tries to upload (only when you leave the camera on, who DOES that?), but it fails miserably.  if you take videos with your camera (who doesn't these days, honestly?), it won't upload them, it'll choke on them.I don't care if someone else got this to work better, even so, the SOFTWARE STINKS!Some self-introspectional doof designed the software, it's horrendous.  Don't apply for a job at Apple my friend, whomever you are.I'd probably say installation were easy, if the product worked.  Since it doesn't, what's the point?I guess if you have tons of free time, go ahead and buy this, and maybe you can get it to work, so long as you don't mind paying extra for the electricity bill to keep the batteries charged while you have to constantly leave the camera on (again, who does that?). But if you value your time, save your money and just get a much bigger memory for the price, and connect the camera to your computer like everyone else.  at least with Picasa or similar software, you'll only mildly be disappointed, but at least have access to your photos.Oh, and one final thing, the cards advertise the ability to not only upload pics and videos to your computer, but also to services like Picasa Web Albums or Flickr.  Ha, yeah right.  NOT.maybe after a couple years of debugging, they can get it to work, but I doubt it.  just too many cameras out there for them to be able to support.  if you want this type of technology, i highly suggest buying a wifi camera, and since they don't sell well, it'll probably be Apple that defines this market eventually, if they can get the patent rights to make a camera.

$REVIEW.: First of all, before you spend money on a spool of network cable you should probably know a little something about the subject so that you can make an educated decision regarding the purchase. I see some reviewers docking stars because they attempted to use this cable for something it wasn't designed for. This stuff is for making patch cables and NOT for first runs in walls, above ceiling panels, and the like. For the purposes that I initially purchased this product, that is making patch and crossover network connections, it's right on the money.I haven't pulled a run with any sort of kink, large or small, as of yet and haven't had any problems with how the cables tested after termination. If you have a consistent need for patch or crossover cables and want to save a few bucks, I would highly recommend this product.

$REVIEW.: I own a great deal of glass... lenses litter my office.  Most of the lenses I'm glad I purchased and a few, well, those go to the Land of Ebay.  This one, however, will never be far from my camera(s).  I owned the predecessor, the 17-70 f/2.8-4.5 HSM, an excellent lens and a supreme value.  Effectively, a 25-105mm, perfect walkabout lens with Macro capability - equally adept at the candid portrait as well as the quick nature shot.  Images post process quite well.  So, it was a bit of trepidation that I purchased the updated lens... would it perform as well?  Would the OS (Image stabilization built into the lens) be effective?  Is it still a great value Nikon lens?  Fortunately, the answer to all three questions is a resounding yes.  If anything, images are a bit sharper out of camera.  OS is effective from 2-3 stops.  And absolutely, this lens is a phenomenal value especially compared to the fantastic 17-55mm f/2.8 NIKON lens priced at a healthy four figures.  So unless you're loaded and/or totally convinced that only Nikon glass can work effectively on Nikon bodies, consider this lens for your arsenal.  It's a strong step up from the kit lenses and a healthy competitor to the venerable 17-55mm.

$REVIEW.: PROSExcellent high ISO images, nice LCD, variety of user adjustments, solid bodyCONSOccasional purple fringing, uses less popular xD memoryCOMMENTSAfter much research, I purchased a Fuji F20 in order to shoot in low light conditions without flash.  The F20 (and its virtually identical sibling the F30) includes Fuji's 6th generation SuperCCD sensor that promises high sensitivity in low light conditions without the usual image noise associated with conventional digital camera sensors.  The F20's ISO range of 100-2000 turns out to be quite useable throughout the range.  I've taken hundreds of pictures in low light at ISO 800, 1600, and 2000 and the images are simply unmatched for their clarity, color fidelity, and lack of noise.  There is no other point-and-shoot camera that can hold a candle to the Fuji sensor's low light capabilities.  The noise "grain" at high ISOs has none of the multicolored pixels that dominate the high ISO images from competitive cameras.  In addition, the Fuji comes wrapped in a nice, solid body with good ergonomics and features for its small size.Prior to purchasing the F20, I've been using a Canon A610 (an excellent camera all around) and have been spoiled by the fine Canon image quality under normal lighting conditions (using ISO 50-200).  It's hard to beat the Canon in daylight using its low ISO settings.  When pushing the Canon to its ISO 400 limit, the images are very good but the multi-colored pixel noise is obvious if not distracting.  The Fuji F20, on the other hand, produces images at ISO 800 that are easily comparable to the Canon's ISO 400 and, in many cases, even its ISO 200 setting.  The Fuji can snap photos under low, natural lighting that the Canon can't even attempt without using its flash.  At normal print sizes, I find the F20's ISO 1600 images completely printable and useable.  Several professional reviews have compared the Fuji F20/F30 image quality at ISO 800/1600 against digital SLR output at similar ISOs and found the Fuji output to hold its own remarkably well.  Now that I've used the F20 in a variety of shooting conditions I can say that its low light output indeed sets a new industry benchmark.  The Fuji F20/F30 has opened up a whole new range of shooting modes that have simply not been possible without investing in high-end SLR equipment.For those who've been wondering whether to go for the F30 or save some dough with the F20, here's my take.  First, the F20 and F30 share the exact same 6MP sensor, processor, and lens.  There will be no difference in image quality between the two cameras.  What the F30 offers is aperture or shutter priority modes, a higher resolution LCD monitor, ISO 3200 instead of 2000, and a longer battery runtime.  However, the F30's pseudo-manual mode may only be marginally satisfying to those craving full manual control since, like most point-and-shoot digitals, the f-stops are limited by the zoom setting you've chosen.  I have seldom relied on using aperture or shutter priority modes in my point and shoot cameras since the program modes are excellent for most of my shots.  As for the LCD, I have compared the F20 and F30 side-by-side and there's little to differentiate them especially since the F20 includes a 153,000 pixel LCD that is already at a higher resolution than most other 2.5-inch screens on competitive cameras.  The LCD alone should not be the deciding factor.  Battery life is very good on the F20 and typical of most consumer cameras at about 250+ shots per charge; however, the F30 nearly doubles the capacity per a single charge and this can be significant for many users who don't wish to have a spare battery on hand.  Personally, I like to have a spare battery handy since I may not always have a full charge on the in-camera battery when I go shooting.  That's just my preference to safeguard against being totally stuck.  Finally, the F30 has an ISO 3200 at its top end compared to the F20's ISO 2000.  But nearly everyone is of the opinion that the F30's ISO 3200 is much less useable than the F20's ISO 2000 (and this may explain why Fuji reduced the F20 setting to something more realistic).  All the other controls such as ISO selection, focus modes, scene modes, LCD refresh rates, and low-light ("anti-blur" as Fuji likes to call it) are the same between the F20 and F30.  To summarize:  The F20 and F30 are identical cameras in terms of image quality.  The F30 comes at a competitive price with some nice additions (though not quite deal-breaking if image quality is your goal).  But the F20 value is simply remarkable and the price difference goes a long way towards buying you a 512 MB xD memory card and spare battery.There is very little to dislike about the F20.  Fuji's 6th generation sensor delivers on its promise for high ISO performance.  Some folks think that Fuji's color saturation is understated but I find it quite natural and more representative of the original scene.  The preference for enhanced color saturation is nothing new -people like "better than real life" colors and so many manufacturers boost the saturation in order to generate what the customer believes looks good.  To address this, the F20 provides a "FujiChrome" color setting to boost saturation but I find the Standard setting to be the most accurate.As for lens performance, I have found moderate amounts of purple fringing in the high contrast areas of some images.  I'm sure Fuji will eventually solve this problem as some other manufacturers have.  I have been impressed at how my Canon A610 is totally free of purple fringing at all focal lengths.  Keep in mind that this purple effect is usually only noticeable when you view the remote details of your images at full size on your computer screen.  You will seldom detect it in printed photos unless your prints are huge or highly cropped.  Focusing performance has been very good with only a few mis-focused shots in very low light settings with the flash disabled.  Nothing unusual here.On the controls front, Fuji has provided a good range of controls such as exposure compensation, multiple scene/low light modes, various flash modes, and an unbeatable ISO range.  There's a really neat mode called Natural+Flash that shoots your scene with and without flash with a single shutter press.  This ensures that you'll always get a good picture to choose from and you won't have to ask people to wait while you change camera modes.  Very, very clever.  I also find Fuji's menu system to be fast and logical to manipulate which is especially useful since most modes are accessed (quickly) through the menu system.Besides manual ISO settings, Fuji also includes a couple modes called AUTO (400) and AUTO (1600) that limits the highest ISO that the camera can select.  I really wish they would have thrown in an AUTO (800) setting since I have no problem allowing the F20 to select up to ISO 800 for just about any photo purpose.  Just remember to dial in -1/3 or -2/3 compensation if you'll be shooting in bright outdoors -you'll help avoid blown highlights that can never be recovered in pp.The only other minor issue is that Fuji is still sticking it out with xD memory while the rest of the world has virtually standardized on SD cards.  Not a major deal, but it will probably require you to buy an xD card (I had to) and possibly a new card reader if you're coming from a different brand camera.  I will probably buy the reader since I'm not fond of downloading images by plugging in the camera to my PC every time.  It would also be nice if Fuji included a separate battery charger instead of requiring the camera to be plugged in for charging.  But this is the concession for making this camera available at such a low price and so I won't blame Fuji for that.Having owned three Canon digital cameras (S10, A60, and A610) I thought long and hard about the switch to Fuji.  The Canons are superb cameras and you're hard pressed to get a bad image from them.  However, I've increasingly found that I prefer to shoot natural light/low light scenes without flash and it is under these conditions that the limitations of conventional imaging sensors become apparent.  This is where the F20 shines and I haven't found any competitive sensor technology that comes close.Fuji is poised to introduce some amazing cameras using this 6th generation sensor.  But they will need the commitment to make sure that their entire camera line-up performs well from the lowest model to the highest. Success can't be built on just one or two successful models amongst a line-up of average offerings.  This may well explain the success of Canon -every one of their cameras is a generally a high performer in its market segment.  If Fuji implements their remarkable new sensors across the board and standardizes on SD memory, just imagine the choices we'll have!  I applaud Fuji for bringing revolutionary CCD technology (that delivers on its promise) to the low-end market.

$REVIEW.: Overall this is a great webcam that is easy to use.I bought this webcam to track how often my wife sleep walks at night.  With the night vision, motion detection, programmable motion detection times, and FTP image upload it is perfect.  I consider myself a &#34;techy&#34; type of person so I didn't have any issues with configuration.  I also have my own domain with web space and FTP access.  You could probably run a simple FTP server on a local computer and have the images transferred to that local computer.  The motion sensitivity is adjustable (1-10), by default it was set on 8 and picked up way too much of us moving in our sleep.  We finally settled on 5, it gets the larger movements in our sleep and every time my wife sleep walks.The motion detection is programmable on a per day basis on 15 minute increments.  This makes for a nice visual display for when images are uploaded.The pan, tilt, and zoom feature is really nice.  This thing is so quiet when it moves, our dogs can't even hear it.  The built in speaker and microphone are average at best but they do work.  The speaker can sometimes have a little echo.  Which really freaked my dog out the first time I tried to talk to them.I would have given it 5 stars but it does lockup when viewing the feed with a desktop computer and web browser for long periods of time.  It then has to be manually restarted which is a pain.  Camera works flawlessly when using the Android app tinyCam.  All the features of the camera can be controlled using this app.If you want to use this camera over your broadband connection you need to be familiar with opening ports on your router and assigning an internal static IP address to the camera.  It does have a Universal Plug and Play feature but I did not use it so I can't speak to how well it works.

$review_text.: Great picture, and the speakers are not that bad, but I want fuller sound. I don't need home theater, just better sound. That seems to be why this TV was such a low price for 32-inch LED, besides it being 720p.  I cant tell that 1080 is better, we have it on other tvs. The kicker is that there is no rca or headphone output.  The only way to add better audio is to buy a home theater system that accepts HDMI.  Most soundbars do not. I looked at soundbars and small home theater systems, but even the small systems take up too much space, with five speakers and a receiver. You can wall mount the speakers, etc. but I want something easy like speakers you plug in.  I connected a wifi bluray and it plays audio through its rca audio out IF you are watching bluray or wifi streams Iike Netflix.  There does not seem to be a way to switch from tv speakers to sound system unless you connect an hdmi sound system which runs around $230 and up.  If I had known about the lack of audio outputs I would have bought a different tv. I ordered an HDMI to rca/3.5mm converter for $28 and hope it works. It will be analog not digital. Samsung needs to do some better consumer research or just say up front, if you buy this it does not have audio outputs.

$REVIEW.: I am having a love/hate relationship with this Belkin Quilted Cover for the iPad mini
 On the positive side, it is very attractive
 The quilted vinyl is very feminine looking, and the black color is understated and elegant
 The stitching is all done very well, and it looks more like a nice planner than an iPad case


 Each corner of the iPad mini is held in by a hard plastic piece, which I think would protect that vulnerable area in the event of a drop
 The case doubles as a stand if you want to sit it up on a table, or use it as a stand in your lap.Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives for me
 The case is heavy
 According to my digital kitchen scale, the iPad mini itself weighs 10.76 ounces


 This Belkin case weighs 7.94 ounces
 So by adding the case, the weight of the iPad mini almost doubles
 The case is also very bulky


 I did not measure, but I would estimate that it almost quadruples the thickness of the svelte iPad mini

 The surprising thing to me is that the case does not work with the magnetic on/off feature of the iPad mini

 Even the least expensive cases I have seen have this feature
 That is my primary reason for only rating this product at 3 stars.If you mostly use your iPad mini at home, then I would recommend this case


 However, my main reason for purchasing an iPad mini was to carry in my purse
 I already have a full sized iPad to use inside my home, and I do not care if that one is a bit heavy


 While this Belkin case is very attractive, the bulk and weight that it adds defeats my reason for buying a small and light device to carry on a daily basis
 I still have the case on, but will probably revert soon to using theMoKo Ultra Slim Lightweight Smartshell Stand Case for Apple iPad Mini 7.9-Inch Tablet, BLACK (with Smart Cover Auto Wake/Sleep)that I purchased here on Amazon


 That particular case offers minimal protection, but it is very thin and light, which meets my personal requirements for an iPad mini case.

$review_text.: Why are they so cheap?  Because to apply them you peel off a piece of plastic, then carefully roll the protector onto the screen, then peel off the paper tab on the protector.  The paper tab is stuck on with a glue that does not peel off, so you are left with a sizable chunk of paper tab glue residue on your screen.  They didn't need to use a nonremovable glue, but they probably made a million of these things with the wrong glue, and now they're giving them away for a little more than the cost of postage.

Have not tried the f/2.8 300mm lens, but with using a higher iso and accepting a little/moderate noise in my photos have not been disappointed with indoor, available light photos at swimming meets.  Have used it to photograph football and fast pitch games, also.

$review_text.: The 500GB MiniStation Thunderbolt/USB 3.0 Portable Drive with Cables by Buffalo Technology come with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt connectors.  It is ready to go for Mac users and contains instructions for PC users.The Thunderbolt has a stylish and functional appearance and is completely portable:  it's bus-powered: runs from power supplied to the connector from the host computer unlike most external hard drives that require separate power.I am a Mac user, and was able to set up the Thunderbolt as my Time Machine backup because it was instantly compatible. I was able to get a complete Mac data backup immediately upon installation.No need to ho out and buy cables - the Thunderbolt comes complete with both a USB 3.0 cable and a Thunderbolt cable I was able transfer, store, and secure my blazingly fast and easily.  What I love most about this unit is that is plug and play. There are no drivers to download and is pre-formatted for Mac computers and Time Machine Backup. There is no need for a separate electric outlet connection. It is simple and perfect for all.
$SUMMARY.: Compact, Convenient, Cables Included perfect for Mac Users or PC

$review_text.: Bought this to replace a 21" CRT (remember those?) that finally died, and because I do a lot of photo editing I wanted good color rendition.Hooked it up to a W7 PC via the DVI-D connector, and it came up at the max resolution by itself, no drivers required


I set the brightness down to 30% though, as recommended by various articles; much better! No dead/stuck pixels, very quick warmup

I don't share some people's strong concerns about the anti-glare coating; although I can see its "sparkly" effect on e.g
white backgrounds if I look closely, it looks no different from many other LCD screens I have worked with


Perhaps lowering the brightness to 30% negates some of those issues? Anyway, not an issue for me, for sure.I ran though the Lagom LCD calibration images (just Google that) and the monitor passed with flying colors right out of the box
I tried installing the calibrated color profile for the 30% brightness/80% contrast settings I found on one of those web sites, but it made things worse (dark colors too bright, and visible banding in gradients)


But of course such a color profile is only really intended for a specific monitor, and I went back to the default settings which look just great to me.Also tried the Displayport cable, and it worked fine too (I switch the monitor between my home PC and work laptop using the OSD's quick input select; no issues)
Have not tried the USB or audio but the USB hub was detected by the PC


I particularly like the ability to set the pixel scaling to 1:1, so that I can play some old games that do not work in wide screen mode in e.g

1600x1200 without stretching.If there is any downside at all, I think it is the cable management, which leaves all the cables quite visible right below the monitor, especially the power cable with its bar code sticker on it.I still get a big grin on my face every time I turn this monitor on and see photos displayed in all their wide screen glory

No regrets at all!Oh yes arrived within 2 days of ordering, with free shipping; the HP box packaged inside a slightly bigger Amazon box
Thank you Amazon and UPS!

$REVIEW.: This Cisco Linksys factory refurbished wireless router is working great for me. I was apprehensive about buying something refurbished, but the unit I got appears to be in brand new condition. Using the easy USB setup key makes connecting very easy. The wireless connection speed is about half as fast as the 300mbs the company claims. Still, at 144.4mbs my wireless connection speed is many times faster than my internet connection. For the money, 144.4mbs is nothing to complain about. 144.4mbs is much faster than any home internet connection you can get. Unless you are moving a lot of large files across your local network, 144.4mbs is many times faster than what you need. I've had the router for over a month and haven't had any problems with the connection so far. I live in a small apartment, so I can't really attest to the range of the wireless connection. At the furthest point away from the router (in my apartment) I still get a full five bar signal. This router is easy to set up, works great, and is very nicely priced.

$REVIEW.: Very impressed with this portable rechargeable battery. Previously I used theKensington PowerLift Backup Battery and Dock for iPhone 4 and 3G/3GS - Charger - Retail Packaging - Black. It worked, sometimes. After 6 month of use I got temperamental connections where my phone would connect and disconnect continually. I'd have to keep pulling the connector out and reinserting it until it connected. One thing about the Kensington is it's a one time use before you need to recharge it. If you were charging your phone from 0%, it would take the full battery of the rechargeable battery then would die. The myCharge Amp is incredible because it has so much battery life to spare, even after charging my iPhone from 3%-75% I still had 5 bars on my battery indicator. This is such a cool gadget, great rubber texture, flashlight is an awesome bonus because why not include one? There's not much you can tack onto a rechargeable battery as "extra," but a battery is a great touch! Light up battery indicator at the touch of a button. This is so well worth the money.My real life experience: out this weekend when my iPhone died and turned off when I needed to get in touch with my family. Plugged my phone into the charger and within a minute the screen came back and I could access my phone. This would have never happened as quickly with the Kensington charger, and my car charger. Also, it's cool to walk around with my phone and use it while it charging. The battery is very light weight and easy to carry both phone and battery around.What I really wish... it came with a small felt bag so I could keep it together with a phone connector for an emergency. I have one so I will put it together as a kit, but would be great if the company included one.FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!

$REVIEW.: These 'phones ROCK!!!!!!I previously owned a pair of the Shure E4c's --- before that, I went in between Bose QC2's, Bang & Olafson A8's, and Sony MDRNC50'sFirst off, I prefer my ShureBuds over the Sony MDR, Bang & Olafson A8, and DEFINITELY over the Bose QC2 & QC3 ---- so if you're looking for confirmation that ShureBuds are better than the others mentioned, then you can confirm it with me now - they areWith that said, I'm going to focus this review on a comparison between the E500's vs the E4c's ---- I'll address the other headphones a little more towards the endI don't use headphones while exercising --- I do a lot of writing, and most of my writing happens on a laptop in coffeeshops and cafes --- thus, I usually wear my headphones while writing, so that I can listen to my tunes and drown out the outside noises ---- I also do a TON of travelling, as I'm taking airplane rides every 2 to 3 weeks, so 'phones are real important here ---- with that said, I need my headphones to be portable, of excellent sound quality, able to block out outside noises, and also flexible enough to allow me to hear the 'outside' world when neededOkay, my reasons for preferring the E500's over the E4c's1. SOUND ---- of course, sound should be the TOP factor of any, and it is in this case --- the sound quality of the E500's is definitely superior and that is mostly because the fidelty is of a higher quality than the E4c's and the bass is more prevalent (but not overly prevalent) --- many headphones (particularly Bose ones) put the bass way too loud in order to compensate for lousy fidelty --- this is where SHURE buds shine, because they don't max out the bass, and instead, give the fidely enough richness to get the song by at its truest quality ---- however, the E4c's in some ways seem to have too little bass, which causes many of the songs to come out too scratchy, with crisp treble but not enough bass ---- with that said, the E500's strike an excellent balance of appropriate bass, with excellent fidelty and treble ---- aside from the increase in bass though, the regular fidelty is of a much higher quality within the E500's --- don't get me wrong ---- the E4c's are great, but there is a big difference in sound quality with the E500's2. COMFORT ---- I am huge on comfort --- while I don't mind the E4c's fit, I could always tell that there was a bud in my ears, no matter what tip-ending I would place upon the buds ---- in addition, I found that the E4c's commonly slipped out of my ears, again, no matter the tip-ending ---- the E500's, on the other hand, are shaped much differently than the E4c's and it is a wonderful change!!! The E500's are a much more comfortable fit, often making me feel that there really isn't anything in my ear --- in addition, they never slip out of my ear (depending on the bud tip that you use) --- so the fit and the comfort here is much better3. SEAL ---- the seal is the buds ability to stay in one's ear, creating a noise seal, not allowing outside sounds to come in, for the purpose of keeping the music good ---- the seal of the E500 is much better than the E4c's, again, because of the comfort ---- the E500's fit much better upon a person's ear and stay there, without one having to stick the buds deep inside one's ear ---- in addition, creating a seal with the E500 is very easy --- I've been taking them on and off with ease, without worrying about getting another good seal, unlike the E4c's, which I dreaded having to take off and often spent too much time finding a good seal with4. PUSH TO HEAR FEATURE ---- I LOVE THIS FEATURE --- a lot of people are complaining about it, but I think its great! ----- the 'phones come with a plastic 'thingy' that, when turned on, reduce the sound of the headphones and instead microphone the sounds taking place outside of your headphones --- so for example, a person coming to talk to you will now be heard, as if, they are talking into a microphone near your headphones, allowing you to respond from there --- overall, this feature allows one to keep the buds in your ears, and turn the music off with ease, in order to hear what's going around you --- I think its a terrific feature overall5. ACCESSORIES ---- I love the accessories and the flexibilities of these headphones --- you can detach the 'buds from the PTH microphone, and hook them up directly to one's iPod ---- or you can add a cord lengthener, etc ---- my fav accessory is a cord base that allows for one to increase the volume of the buds, without having to touch the iPod controls ---- in addition, all cord accessories are gold plated, keeping the sound solid all around --- lastly, the 'phones come with a great carry case, that keeps everything together in a small packageOTHER HEADPHONES -----As mentioned above, I prefer the Shure E500PTH over the Bose QC2, Bose QC3, Sony MDRNC50, and the Bang & Olafson A8I find that the Bose QC2 and Bose QC3 pump up the bass WAY TOO MUCH, not allowing for the song's true fidelty to come throughI actually like the SONYMDRNC50's a lot, especially the 'monitor' button that acts a lot like the Shure's PTH features ---- however, I find the Shure buds to have a superior sound quality over the Sony MDR's and I also prefer the smaller sizeLastly, the Bang & Olafson A8's are a GREAT pair of headphones, but they do not provide any kind of seal within one's ear --- it comprimeses the sound for me too much, in this case, however they are a great set of 'phonesPRICE -----Price is a BIG factor --- yeah, it seems ridiculous to purchase headphones that cost more than an iPod, but if sound is important and you can afford the costs, then I DEFINITELY recommend splurging on the good soundIf you have the budget to purchase the E4c's, then I say pony up the extra money to go with the E500's ---- the phones are of excellent build, can take a lot of abuse and will last forever --- splurge now and be happy for years! Unlike computers, headphone technology is not updated constantly --- thus, these headphones can be used for a loooooooong time!!!CONCLUSION ----I think the E500's are an excellent purchase ---- I'm big on sound and I'll be attaching these suckers to my hip, ready to listen to my iPod at any time --- if you got the budget and tunes are important, then these are YOUR 'phones!!!HAPPY BUYING ---- may peace and love be upon you all!!!!!

This product serves it's purpose, and I don;t hear an additional decrease in sound quality.  I have had mine for four months so far without any problems.  I do not take good care of my electronics, and I see how this will certainly eventually rip at the seams, but for the time being it is a sturdy device, and a good price.

$review_text.: So, I upgraded my Rip with a Sync


As an after thought, I decided to also get this Jot - without first reading the reviews
This is a One-Trick Pony


It does not save anything, i.e
one page only


It is not rechargeable


When the battery runs out, you have to throw it away


And you can not link it to your Smartphone, Tablet, nor Laptop


Once you use the One Page, you erase it and start again
I thought I could use this to replace my Rhodia, but not quite
It does take your note

The screen is like the Sync in that it takes awhile for it to &#34;warm up&#34; to being written on; the contrast is lacking from the Rip

Still a good product, just not the product you think it is.

$review_text.: I bought two sets of these. The first set is in the family room, as the major audio part of a small stereo system, which includes an inexpensive 2-channel Sony amp, Sony DVD/CD player, and a 50-inch wall mounted Panasonic plasma HDTV. The speakers have decent bass; I have no intention of adding a subwoofer. No complaints, and the little towers look good, too. I liked them so much I tried them out as replacement rear speakers in my larger living room (18X14) 5.0 system (60-inch Sony HDTV, Denon 591 receiver, Blu-Ray, DVD and CD players). The Sonys complement the front pair of ancient "higher quality" Pioneer CS77 bass reflex speakers in the front. I was impressed (the price helped), enough to order a second set.  Do they sound as good as the 40 year old Pioneers with 12-inch woofers? No. Do they sound better than the rear speakers they replaced? Definitely Yes. I may add a subwoofer in the living room. I'm glad I bought two sets.

$review_text.: My canon camera finally conked out after 10 years and my husband bought me this one to replace it

I love it


It practically does everything itself

Fits in the palm of your hand so you can walk down road snapping pictures without anyone even knowing what you are doing

I put a couple on here to show you how vivid they are
I am an amateur when it comes to photography but I thought these came out great...so I give full credit to the camera


I certainly never took that good a pictures with the other one


It also has different settings to make it easier...like for snow, sunset, darkness, portrait, landscape, sports, etc
And the little video does great too
Unbelievable that one little camera can do all this and cost a third of what my canon cost 10 years ago
Very easy to install the software but doesn't have a lot of directions in the booklet that comes with it
There is a disc but it doesn't have a lot of information either


Actually you don't need to know much though

Once you start playing with it, you learn it pretty quick

It will literally store hundreds of pictures before you have to delete them out for more space


What a great bargain!

$review_text.: Excellent speakers, what else is there to say?Huge sub woofer, lots of bass if you want it.Excellent control center with wireless remote.Optical in gives a level of clarity you don't get with the 6 channel direct.Love the different sound modes with pro logic II.Uses normal detached 2 strand wire that you connect just like a regular sound receiver. (instead of attached to speaker with the rca plug)  This makes adding more length very easy, and allows you to use standard speaker wire.very nicely packaged, even included batteries for the remote.Cons?These are expensive especially for computer speakers.  Takes a pretty hard core pc guy to dish out nearly 400 dollars for speakers.  But its something you can use for years to come, that is if you take care of them.  This is probably the last of its kind, high end quality 5.1 system for a pc, especially one that has optical out, either on the pc motherboard/sound card, or speaker system that accepts it.I am impressed, excellent speakers.

$review_text.: I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSandisk Ultra 32GB Class 10 Micro SD Card (SDSDQU-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of 12.6MB/s according to "CrystalDiskMark" (see my uploaded picture in `Customer Images' section for details). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using "Flash Memory Toolkit" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card is priced similar to other (slower) class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. TheLexar microSDHC 300x 32GB UHS-I(LSDMI32GBBNL300R) is faster , but it is priced nearly twice as much. So I consider this Sandisk card the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as "2 to the power 30", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.

$review_text.: Simple, very inexpensive. If you mess up a couple as you are learning, it is no big deal. I would have preferred the fancy kind which allows the tiny wires to pass right through the front of the connector in order to verify the colors (before being trimmed off), but those are significantly more expensive and may have required a much more costly crimping tool. These work reliably, though my water-resistant Cat-6 cable is so thick and tough that I had to carefully trim out the inner casing before the outer casing would fit into the connector for crimping; I suspect that would be true of most all standard RJ45 connectors.
$SUMMARY.: inexpensive, reliable, terminating connectors for network cabling

$REVIEW.: This is a good plug-and-play addition to a small-speaker system such as a sound bar. I get the feeling of freedom from the constraints of sound spectrum by a modest midrange sound system, so can relax that I'm going to hear all that the source produced regardless of whether there's bass there or not in the music. Deep sounds (thunder) in movies are great - I don't hear any distortions at reasonable volume settings.I remember a long time ago building heavy, complex cabinets, winding crossover coils, and spending a lot for big speakers (and adding a high-power, expensive amp) just to get the same result as this unit. Controls for crossover are there but I find the setting not very critical. The volume control is important for blending. It just works. I'm pleased, especially for the modest price.

Battery life is excellent, I rarely need to change the batteries

I use rechargeable batteries and they work fine
Sound quality isn't "full" but adequate for their size


Very compact and due to the fact that they are an older model I have to give them credit for building a reliable device

$REVIEW.: I've been using Logitech products for over 20 years and for my needs (scientific and engineering), consider this mouse less than sufficient.i) The scroll wheel on the mouse I received has too little rolling friction and difficult to differentiate indents, the wheel being capable of spinning freely for about 1+ second. Hence, simply bumping the wheel too hard or rubbing the top of the wheel as I move my finger from left to right button causing the frame to move or jitter.ii) It's not practical to move the mouse across a surface, less inadvertently rotate the scroll wheel, using my index finger to nudge the mouse slightly (e.g. 1-2 pixels). Hence constantly having to raise or gently reposition my index finger to and from the scroll wheel. A person's index finger being more accurate at placing and guiding an object such as a mouse and pointer as appose to using the thumb and lesser finger(s).iii) The scroll wheel overshoots most of the time going up and down the screen, or requiring far too much attention making this particular mouse annoying and fatiguing after less than 30 minutes of "high attention" use (e.g. CAD diagrams, illustrations, text editor).iv) Attempting to make the mouse more precise and predictable in motion, by reducing the number of scroll lines from 3 to 2 lines per wheel rotation indent making the mouse too slow for long documents. The end choice being, right speed and imprecise placement with some jitter, or too slow for anything in excess of a medium size document, e.g. 20+ pages.v) Tilting the scroll wheel left and right, does not cause the browser frame to translate left to right, instead the browser goes back and forth between URLs.vi) Wheel (center) button down force does not match well with respects to scrolling friction. Hence pressing the center button tends to result in the frame to scroll or jitter instead of remaining stable and in place.Minus 1.0 for too loose a scroll wheel and insufficient indents.Minus 1.0 for not matching center button down force with scrolling friction.Minus 0.5 for non standard left-right tilting scroll wheel function.Minus 0.5 for overall accuracy, high fatigue and limited usability range.

No, they do not have any metal or glass in their construction. All they, or any extension tube, are intended to do is to act as a spacer between the camera and the lens. This the budget extension tubes do very well. They are easy to use and they have given me some excellent close-ups,allbeit at the end of the season, of my roses. If you want to get some extremely close detailed photos of flowers, insects or anything else macro and you don't want to spend a hundred dollars or more these tubes are the answer as far as I am concerned.

I thought I'd done my research well. I wanted higher quality earbuds than the standard Apple ones that come with iPhones. Much to my dismay, the very reason to use the new earbuds was the mic and people on the other end could barely hear me. I kept trying and would end up switching to my Apple earbuds during calls. I wanted to make sure it was across the board and not just one person who couldn't hear me. Since these were a gift, I didn't know how to return them to Amazon where they were purchased. They've literally sat in my room barely used all this time. Once in a great while, I'll use them for just listening to something on my MAC, only to remember how uncomfortable they are to wear. What a waste of a gift and money. Very disappointing.

$review_text.: I bought this at Wal-Mart a few weeks ago
 The old RCA I got in 2001 finally crapped out and I wanted a cheap replacement


 I chose to pay a little extra for the Sony (I've always been a fan of their products) over the Magnavox since I am dissatisfied with the few Magnavox things I own


 I wasn't aware this was a rebadge of a Phillips according to another reviewer
 That does surprise me
 But it's pretty good nonetheless.Over the last week or so I have used the hell out of it while taking some time off work


 Build quality is fairly sturdy


 Retail discs and at least 6 different brands of burned discs all worked well without a single error and all had a reasonable load time
 The text & display menus are a little crude but that's to be expected of a cheaper player


 Surprisingly it has a rather wide range of settings/options
 It does have a front time display which alot of the cheapies don't
 The remote is OK but it lacks the zoom button that I like to use

 Remote response seemed fairly prompt
 I don't have any major complaints about it


 I can't really comment on longevity considering its only 3 weeks old.For a $35 DVD player it's pretty good at what it does
 It doesn't have all the bells & whistles of a more expensive one but it's a good choice for the money
 Right now I can't justify spending too much on a DVD player due to Bluray

 I'd recommend using an inexpensive unit like this for standard DVDs instead of wearing out the laser in your $150 Bluray player.

$REVIEW.: I originally bought this to use with my older generation iPod that doesn't have onboard bluetooth


 It worked great at first and had no issues


 However, it started acting up and now I only get a signal in one ear or not at all


 It looks like the problem is the audio cable

 I tried different wired headphones and they worked, so the problem isn't with the iPod

 I also tried in my PC and had same issue

 If I move the head of the audio cable around then the signal comes through

 However, I have to keep it in that position all the time

 I had this in my pocket most of the time with my iPod


 I guess you need to keep it in same position or something


 The audio cable is flimsy and really thin

 I didn't notice that until it stopped working
 Gonna ask for refund and check for something else cause I hate knocking out wired headphone cables when I move around
 That was my only reason for getting a transmitter.By the way, only had this for about a month or so before started acting up.

I was going to build my speakers into the drywall but found that the way they radiate energy (broader from side to side than 180 degrees) a projected speaker positioning was mandatory

Now, after installing with the Bose bracket I think the speakers look better - and certainly perform better, than a flush mounting

$REVIEW.: I spent quite some time reviewing the various cards to decide which one of the 680's I wanted

I ended up sticking with EVGA since my last 3 video cards were from them even though they chucked their lifetime warranty (now you have to pay $30 extra for two more years of warranty or $60 extra for 7 more years warranty on top of the 3 years you get with the card)


The dual fan was the deciding factor along with the factory overclock
This card is whisper quiet (quieter than my previous 580 GTX that only had one fan and I thought that card was quiet) and runs really cool, way cooler than my previous 580 GTX, and pulls less juice too


Performance is monster fast


Eats up every game I throw at it and then says, "what else you got, I'm still hungry"
I'm not an SLI guy, one monitor and one card is all I will ever need and want
With this card I'm all set

Not only this, but after only a couple months of use, it starts to fizzle, crackle, then sound like a digital robot, then stop working after about 15-min. to 1-hr. of use.

It was a little odd that the drive didn't immediately become recognized, but the driver was really old and I used the "Computer Management" console in windows, then "Disk Management" to choose the portable drive (DO NOT FORMAT YOUR C: Drive or any other hard drives) and format it. This leaves you a clean slate to store your stuff on. However, if your drive is newer, it will likely have a driver online that you can download and install in windows to make the hard drive work. The Sanoxy 2.5" sata case and adapter is your key to accomplishing a lot with these drives. Please be sure not to format anything if you are not 100% certain of what you are doing. Just a suggestion.

There are a lot of hands on trial and error to set it up and I wouldn't recommend it for continuous home use. I would however, highly recommend two of the major functions as an additional network for the house for when guests come to visit and as a travel network.The travel network is the perfect for this device. It's small, about the size of an old iPod when you combine the cables and power adapter. While most hotels have wireless unless you're in the room with the floor router it's not going to be a useful connection. Plug this into the wired network which is in most rooms and you have a dedicated network.The secondary network most would not see this as big deal but times are changing. It is now very commonplace to have network peripherals like storage, printers and scanners. When guests come over it is nice to let them check their email or surf the internet and now you can have a quick network they can use while maintaining the separation. Not to say your friends are snoops, but you shut your bedroom door when guests come by, so why leave your digital home wide open?If you're willing and able to stumble your way through the set up, this device makes a good addition to your home and travel set-up.

$REVIEW.: Wireless... in order for my router to recognize the WPS client I had to enable SSID Broadcast... otherwise it would not connect to the RouterNo Sound... I have a 60" WD series Mitsubishi DLP and am running an HDMI cable out of the N100 into the DLP.  I run a digital coax out of the DLP and into my DENON RECEIVER. With default settings I got no sound.  I called Sony support and they were very helpful.  They  downloaded the DLP reference manual and verified all my DLP settings were correct.  They then had me turn DEEP COLOR off on the SCREEN SETTINGS on the N100 and that fixed the sound problem.  Odd but true.  Hope this helps someone out there!It doesn't seem to support very many music file formats... again seems odd for a media server. I didn't see AVI format supported, but could be wrong.
$SUMMARY.: Just got it.

$review_text.: I bought my Coolpix L100 about a month ago, before now I was a devoted Canon Powershot owner but the newer powershots are either too expensive, or too stupid

 The L100 was the right price and seemed simple enough for me to try.First, what I don't like:  No viewfinder, so if you break the LCD the camera is useless
 However, it was a chance I was willing to take since the price was low enough

 Second, it will only take movies for 25 minutes, then you will need to start up a new movie


 Usually my movies are less than that time anyway, but still I don't see a reason to limit the movie time if your SD card can handle a longer movie time
 Your battery life will be VERY low, once again because of the only LCD option, and you are not supposed to use rechargeable batteries


 so get used to buying a lot of double A's.Now what I do like:  It takes wonderful pictures, very warm, and is by far the simplest camera to use


 If you want a camera that lets you to adjust speed/light/etc then buy THAT type of camera, don't buy the simple ones for people that just want to take pictures


 This, is set up so even a child can take a good picture

 Back Light option takes great pictures of people in front of windows, Macro takes great close up, etc
 Zoom is awesome, although it doesn't work nearly as well when you are shooting a movie.So, for the money, definately a good purchase


 For a bit more money I would have liked a viewfinder, more movie time and more zoom capability while shooting in movie mode, other than that it's a wonderful camera.

$review_text.: This review addresses one flaw in the design of this card. I have a Macbook Pro, 15". While it is certainly desirable that the card push in close to flush when it is inserted into the Express 34 slot, this card actually inserts below flush. This makes it very difficult to push in the card to get it to "click" again and remove it. On the other hand, when I insert my Sony Memory sticks using the included memory stick adapter that is necessary to use the card, pushing in the memory stick adapter often "clicks" the card, and then when I go to remove the memory stick adapter, it pulls out the card every time.So, if you have trouble getting the card to click and remove, use a memory stick adapter because it has enough friction drag to help you easily remove the card.I wanted to simply leave the card installed because I have nothing but SD and Memory stick memory from my devices. However, the card contains no little cover to protect the inside from gathering dust and dirt. You must therefore remove the card periodically and inspect the inside and clean. I actually took one of the memory stick adapters, and cut it off and adapted it so that it sticks out just a quarter inch so that it doubles as a cover and as a convenient card remover.

$review_text.: Nice package and presentation - lot's of check-list features and not too bad of a price considering video monitoring systems on the market.  But that's where the fun ends.  Installed pretty easy and was up and running fairly quickly. So much for the good part - The system itself is pretty lame.  Camera quality is pretty grainy. You're given two video resolutions but neither are good.  More like "worst" and "less worse".I have mine set to monitor both camera "flip flop" style. One image displays for a few seconds and then switches to the other camera's image. I then have it set to auto-record on motion. For whatever reason, it only picks up motion once in a while. Not reliable at all when you want to have a record of activity. I'm not saying it doesn't work, just not 100%. In my estimation, it's between 50 and 70 percent. Not great - but even good? Apart from the motion detection / recording flaw, I've had the unit lock up on me.  Another hit to the reliability factor. The screen quality is bad too. A 7" is actually an okay size and it looks like a digital picture frame. But the picture is so washed out the color is nearly non-existent. Looks like some sick black and white version. Record time is severely limited if you use the "less worse" video mode with the provided 2GB SD card. You're guaranteed to need a larger card if you go with this camera - plan on at least 8GB or better and factor that into the cost. Range is also another big factor - if you house is 2,000+ square feet - plan on buying the "optional antenna" from Lorex for another 100 bucks. My signal fades even though the cameras aren't more than 50-100 ft from the base station. Another problem is you can't auto-record when you're in quad view. Expanding to the 4 cameras the system supports is another "surprise" in that the cameras actually cost more than buying another system.  That is to say each camera is at least $165 so you're better off buying two systems. That's kind of strange to me.  You can get a cheaper version of the camera that has one-way audio - no intercom feature. It's just over $100 from what I've seen.I do like the intercom feature - kind of creepy but works pretty well. Since I have the cameras in front of my house though, it doesn't do me much good unless I want to call the kids inside or say hello to my neighbors. (The creepy factor...)I hope the simple presence of the cameras will provide some security but if you rely on this thing to do the job for you - you'll be sorely disappointed as I was. (Not to mention a few hundred dollars lighter and proud owner of a lame duck security system.)Here's some things that would make this system better / acceptable:1.) Camera range / picture quality2.) Distance motion detection (Most things are not going to be right in front of the camera) The distance should reach at least 100ft day/night. Right now it's maybe 50ft day, 10-12ft at night.3.) Battery option for the camera - having them outside means rigging power to your "wireless" camera4.) External storage - USB port5.) Higher video quality6.) Reliability - no lockups, etc

$REVIEW.: I ordered this to use with a Contax G 90 lens and my Nex7.  Was excited to use the lens on the Nex.  Upon first inspection, the Fotodiox adapter seems well made with good finish.  There was a little bit of oil residue visible on the adapter, which I suppose is necessary for lubrication and smooth rotation.Attaching the adapter on the lens, was pretty straightforward -- which justifies no instructions with the adapter.  So far so good.Then, I attached the adapter with lens on to the Nex7.  Turned on the camera and put it in the right mode and setting.  Ready for my first shot -- of course needed focus assist/peaking.Now the problem -- it was very difficult to turn the focus ring on the adapter.  It would get stuck in many positions in both directions.  Practically un-usable.  I struggled and managed to take one shot before the thought that I had attached the lens to adapter incorrectly crossed my mind.  I detached, and tried again many times with no better success.  I had rated it 3 stars hoping to upgrade the rating to 4 or 5, but unfortunately I can not recommend this adapter after having two duds.Is it the FotoDiox adapter or my lens that's the problem??To find out, I separated the adapter from the lens, and looked at the lens itself.  Using a small flat-head screwdiver on the focus mechanism of the lens, it was very easy to turn to make the lens extend and protract (for focus).Then with just adapter in hand, I attempted to rotate the focus ring, and in one direction it was fairly smooth.  In the opposite direction, it locked up in many places.  Kept rotating the ring hoping it would lubricate and eventually smooth out, but no such luck. In fact, I was getting intermittent locks in both directions now.I concluded that I received a bad/defective adapter.  Promptly called Amazon to arrange a return.I've ordered another with overnight shipping since I'm leaving for a trip in two days.  Hoping that the 2nd order will be better.  If not, the Contax G lens won't make the trip, and I'll have to find a different adapter to use this lens.Btw, while the lens/adapter was on the Nex 7, I managed to take 1 shot after struggling to get focus and the lens appears to be a keeper.  Please, oh please new adapter be good!Cheers!---------The 2nd adapter arrived, and sad to say that it didn't do much better.  I found that, in order to not have it lock and grind on manual focusing, I had to pull the focus ring toward the camera as I turned it.  That and gripping it a certain way made it easier, but if I didn't remember to do this then it definitely would lock up.  There are times even when the focus ring moves, but the lens doesn't move with it which suggests that the adapter's design isn't deep enough where it contacts with the focus mechanism of the ring.I'm going to see if I can find a used Kipon or Metabones adapter as I've read elsewhere that these focus rings are smooth.
$SUMMARY.: 1st try was a dud... trying again for better luck 2nd time

$review_text.: Picture Quality is excellent on this set. The standard picture setting preset is near flawless when compared to calibration patterns and even standard def TV becomes tolerable when watching in the wide-fit picture mode.When using HDMI be sure to adjust the HDMI black level setting to avoid overly dark images but otherwise near perfect. The just-scan picture mode is great for high def sources like bluray, gaming or even HD broadcast; be sure to use game mode for gaming as this set introduces a lot of lag otherwise.The 120 frame auto-motion is fairly useless however and the TV looks its best when this feature is turned off. The one time it may have been useful, gaming, becomes a moot point since you can't have the auto motion on while in game mode. Bluray 1080p/24fps is awesome though and the 120 frames per second makes this possible so it is still worth it to have.The only real complaint I have is that the plastic bezel, the touch of color border around the edge of the screen, came with some factory defects in it; a noticeable dimple near the buttons and many many scratches that are clearly visible in some lighting situations. In direct sunlight the bezel also shows its transparency which can be distracting and make the TV look like a cheap plastic set.Overall though I don't have any regret in buying this set as it oozes quality from almost every aspect; little things like the blue filter and auto disabling of inputs that aren't powered on to make switching sources easier really give the impression that time was taken when designing the set. I just wish I could make it ignore the standard analog coax input because I will never, EVER use that. Period. This isn't a complaint against this TV though as EVERY HD TV I've used does this for some reason.Until new technology becomes mainstream, maybe OLED TVs, I can't see LCDs getting a whole lot better than this so buy with confidence.

$review_text.: Getting the right monitor is a balancing act. My own monitor is a 27 inch 2560x1440Apple Thunderbolt Displaywhich I love but know is not for everyone due to cost and Thunderbolt requirement. I also have a 27 inch 1920x1080HP 2711xwhich is cheap but has a poor picture and horrible viewing angles. In the middle, price wise, I bought this 24 inch 1920x1200 monitor for my wife, mainly because that is the maximum resolution supported by her 4 year old Mac Mini, and I have been pleased with the choice.At a higher resolution and smaller size than the 2711x, text is smooth and clear, while the IPS panel gives great viewing angles, and the colors have fine saturation without being cartoonlike.  It's comparable in picture quality and brightness to the more expensive Thunderbolt display and leaves the cheaper monitor in the dust.On the negative side, USB power management is too aggressive. I really don't want to power down my USB devices if I turn off the monitor. I ended up not using the built in USB hub, this contrasts with the Thunderbolt which has USB, FireWire, Ethernet, a camera, a microphone, Thunderbolt out, speakers, a MacBook charging cable, and a subwoofer, most of which I use daily.  So, this monitor is mainly about its excellent display and not accessories. I am happy it has a DisplayPort, in addition to DVI, so there is some future proofing there.The buttons and display LEDs are attractive, easy to find, and the configuration menu is easy to navigate.In general, if you want a real computer monitor, don't have special requirements and are willing to pay for quality, I think you will be more than happy with this beautiful device.

$review_text.: Prior to receiving this, I was using aBear Motion Case for iPad 2, which I think is just about perfect.I don't mind the rotatable plastic tray design of the Macally, but I prefer the leather frame of the Bear Motion case: apart from the Home button and the front camera, there's nothing on the border you need access to, so the "full frontal exposure" the Macally's plastic tray affords is unnecessary. I had a bit of trouble snapping the iPad into the tray initially, and even more trouble when I went to get it out. I presume the intent is that you won't want to take it out, but given how many iPad peripherals are incompatible with any case, ease of removal is pretty crucial for me.The stand design is fine, but it depends on the weight of the iPad to create friction against the inside cover in order to stand up. Seems like a little nudge the wrong way would make it fall flat. EDIT: Since I first published this, I have noticed that two edges of the tray have small rubber pads on them that add more resistance when standing. Still it depends on friction, which makes it more susceptible to bumping than the Bear Motion case.The clasp is solid, but it's oriented in a way that is intuitively backwards from what I would expect: the first few times I went to open the case, I was momentarily thrown, because the tray is attached to the side that I would instinctively think of as the cover. I was also a bit disappointed that Macally didn't take advantage of the magnetic shut-off the way the Bear Motion case does: that's a key feature of the iPad 2 and should be taken into consideration, particularly for a case that's iPad 2-specific. This really just a head-scratcher, not an actual problem: the tray allows easy access to all the buttons, so it's not hard to turn the display off when the cover's closed.The Macally is a bit heavier than the Bear Motion, but most of the weight seems to be the plastic tray. The cover of the Bear Motion case feels heavier, though the plastic inside the leather on the Macally case is less flexible and feels more durable. The Bear Motion case does have a hole for the rear camera, but it's not that much easier to use than the Macally, which requires that its tray be rotated 90 degrees; for the Bear Motion, the cover must be left hanging open or folded into its stand configuration.Ultimately, though, I like using the Bear Motion case better. It stands better, if somewhat awkwardly, and seems to offer as much protection as the Macally case. At the time this review was written, the Macally was priced about 20% higher than the Bear Motion, and that makes it a slam-dunk for me.

There is however a small gap of about 1/4" where the flap meets the bottom part that isn't covered. It is also a bit flimsy. I also discovered that my eee pc 10" had a zip up neoprene type puch that came with it. So, I since this can be stretched over it, I may put this one on the computer and stick it in the bigger bag when I travel, as it does fit inside that one, to give it a little more cushion, since both bags are thin.So, first of all make sure that your eee 10" doesn't come with a bag, and only buy this if you want double the cushion (which is still kind of flimsy, even together).

$review_text.: I've had my Roku 2 XD 1080p for about a month now, and it's been an education!  But considering that it was free, I cannot complain.  There are multiple websites that explain how to use the Roku, along with Netflix & Hulu Plus to pretty much replace cable, with The Jenny Pincher being my favorite.  Even the cost of Amazon Prime seems reasonable when you include all the movies and tv shows they stream at no cost!I've started from scratch with this Roku, because I did not even know it existed until I got a postcard from Dish Network about how my losing AMC and other channels will not be a problem if I contact them, and so I did!  They sent me out a brand new Roku 2 XD 1080p directly from Amazon at no cost AND have credited my account the cost of several streaming full seasons of upcoming AMC tv shows like Mad Men, The Killing, Breaking Bad, Hell on Wheels and of course, the fanastic Walking Dead thru Amazon Prime!  At $35 per season, I have made off with those credits, especially considering that I also got this Roku box!  And Dish promises that all the credits and freebies will remain on your account permanently!  I encourage anyone to get all the freebies they can from Dish so they will bring back AMC and the other channels that are gone!To set up my Roku, everything connected really easily for me, and there really does seem to me channels for every taste!  There is even a channel to put on when your dog is home alone, just to entertain the dog!  Go figure!You can use either an HDMI cable, or a special RCA cable (the comes with the box), where the special end is one small  plug in for the back of the Roku box, but the red, yellow & white RCA cables are normal for the other end.  I'm using the HDMI.  There is also a slot where you can add a micro SD card in case you run out of room dowwnloading channels.  I had a spare 2 gig micro SD, so I put it in just in case I ran out of room....I did not want to be caught unaware.I hope that I continue to have such easy times with this puppy!

$review_text.: This reader is very fast on big file transfer. On little files it is not much different than a usb2 reader. USB3 devices are generally limited by the speed of their data sources and that applies here so there is not much difference in speed on small files but large files in the 10mb up category do seem to transfer substantially quicker. The fit of the cards in the sockets is good [I only checked the 3 formats I own CF-SD-MicroSD] and the overall construction feels substantial...A rubberized base would be nice so it would grip the surface of the desk and not slide around. especially when your doing a one hand insert. Overall the product works well.

$REVIEW.: I bought the 2 GB model because at the time it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs. This is the V Plus version, so it sports an FM tuner and the ability to display videos as a bonus.Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NPR's website, or NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.
$SUMMARY.: Not Ready for Prime Time?

$REVIEW.: This little monitor works wonders! I initially bought it because I wanted a third monitor, so I was looking at the big ones. But then I realized that, going to college soon, those wouldn't be very transportable. So I looked into this one, and decided to take the shot. It serves as my third monitor. It is extremely convenient for placing a window that I want open, but that I don't want in the way of everything else. With a super-long USB cable (one I provided myself) it is very convenient to put over at my music keyboard to work on typesetting music without having to lug my whole laptop all the way over there. The only issue it sometimes has is it will sometimes disconnect very briefly, but I expect this will be a less recurring event. Overall, superb little monitor! I would buy another, if I were to need it and I wanted to spend the $80.Excellent!

$review_text.: For the money, this thing is awesome.======Product:It's an around-ear headphone with surprisingly good bass, however noise isolation is next to none. Good cable length, and adjusts well.======Microphone:The microphone is completely adjustable and has a built in foam pop filter that works pretty well. Sound quality on the microphone is damn near excellent for a headset mic - on the other end listeners can hear everything without any muffled sound. It's very good.======Sound:Like I said, good dynamic range. Not much on noise isolation but I do like how it's an around-ear headphone, adds to the comfort factor that I don't have to keep readjusting this every few minutes. I can sit with these on for 2-4 hours with no problem when I game.======Attachment:The headset has a volume and muting attachment which makes it ridiculously easy to adjust volume and mute/unmute yourself. I originally thought it was super clunky but over time I've gotten used to it and I actually prefer it to the smaller ones that I always end up fiddling around with to work.======For &#60;$20 - this thing is a steal. I'm not super interested in paying upwards of $50 for a headset I don't use all the time so this is a good alternative and is quite useful.
$SUMMARY.: Good value for the money, question is how long it'll last but it's good quality and works well

$REVIEW.: I received the lens yesterday. I spent a few hours testing and calibrating AF microadjustment on 5DMkII. It never gave me acceptable level of focus/sharpness at f4 or below. Throughout the whole aperture range, the images are much softer than my 24-105 f4L in side-by-side comparison. I did not like the color as much as any of the lenses I have. Overall, the images I get from this particular lens were disappointing.I believe I received a bad copy, because a prime lens cannot be this bad and I have seen very nice results by other reviewers. I wanted to exchange with another copy but Amazon did not gave me the option as the product was "being reviewed" and temporarily unavailable at Amazon. I do not know what it means, but it makes me wonder. I give a 3-stars (neutral) as I believe I received a bad copy and the return process has been easy so far. If I were to evaluate the particular copy I received, I would have to give a 1-star.

$REVIEW.: This HB-29 compatible hood has a solid feel and I presume it is a good fit on the previous model of 70-200 f/2.8 lens, the so-called &#34;VR-1&#34; version

The surface doesn't look as finely molded as a genuine Nikon hood and I presume the lower price accounts for that.However....
some comments here claim it also works on the newer 70-200 f/2.8 VR-II which uses the HB-48 hood
I purchased it on that advice
After quite a time trying, I never succeeded in attaching it to my VR-II lens


Your experience may be different
The rating is based on how it appears, since I cannot actually evaluate it on my VR-II lens.

$REVIEW.: I have had the this TV (TC-P65VT60) for approximately three weeks.  While the picture rates 5 stars, the technical support, which I have queried 8 times is the worst I have ever seen, staffed by untrained morons, including the supervisors I have spoken with.  It is so bad that I have vowed NEVER to buy any other Panasonic TV in my lifetime.  I realize that the average rating might be considered the average, but a 0 and a 5 still comes out to 1, the least allowed, in my book.To start off with, parts were missing, mainly screws but also other things in the torn bag that had been dumped into the box.  It took two full weeks for them to send me the WRONG parts. No person in tech support for all of the above named eight phone calls has EVER been able to answer even the simplest of questions.  On the last question regarding the facial recognition camera which only points at the upper part of the opposite wall with no apparent adjustment, requiring me to stand on a stool in order for the camera to see me, I cannot get it to register my face at all.  I have called THREE times to report this and get progress updates, and the idiots only say initially that it needed to be elevated to another level and I would be telephoned.  After three weeks there has been no call and on the two subsequent queries by me I have been told they are "working on it" and I will be contacted.  Honestly, THREE WEEKS!Some will respond and complain that I should have just evaluated the TV alone, but, IMHO, the support service is just as much a part of the service as the quality of the product.  If you can't get it to do all you have paid for and you can obtain absolutely no help, then tech support IS a relevant purchase issue.In addition to the tech support issues, I must comment on the extremely poorly written and unhelpful written manual.  What good is a TV with a terrible manual and poor tech support??  One more issue is the fact that assembly of the TV on to its stand will require 2-3 able bodied people and that the TV does NOT swivel on its base, a major shortcoming IMO.

$review_text.: I needed a seven port 2.0 hub to work with my older MacBook Pro. Reviews of other products talked about hubs dropping to 1.0 if even one such connector was plugged in with other 2.0 cables attached to their units. I found a video review on this model and ordered it with confidence. I was not disappointed. One tip, the cover has to be moved back to expose the other two USB connectors. When I first did this it took a little more push than I expected and I did not want to break the unit. Turns out that was just because it is new. The cover slides back and forth easily now. The unit is very well made. I immediately filled all seven slots and routinely swap out items using the top two plugs. It has been flawless. There are still quality products being made out there, that are well built and do what needs to be done. This is one of them.

$REVIEW.: This particular model seemed to have more useful features than many of the even more expensive models
 I purchased it as a gift and consulted the recipient after they lived with it for a month to see how they like it...Overall it is working good and they are happy but she suggested 4 over 5 stars because the connector base is a bit sensitive and an ipod touch can easily get bumped out of place or not seated correctly and if that goes unnoticed until morning and your alarm is set to use the ipod music then you will get a very silent alarm


 She does however really like the gradual wake up feature and the ability to set the max volume for the alarm
 So overall it is good and does the job it is intended for but a cheap connection prevents a 5 star review.

$review_text.: Well, I won't claim this is a perfect product, I have usediPod 20GB, Creative Zen Extra 40gb, iRiver PMP-140(40GB),iRiver H10 5GB/20GB. By far I consider archos is thebest among all.I don't like iPod or Creative. Don't get me wrong, they arefind products, but I just hate the way they organize themusic purly by the information stored inside the MP3 files.I like to organize my songs by directories and sub-directories,and maybe sub-directories under sub-directories, just like ahard drive. But in iPod and Creative I feel like all my albumsare spreaded all over the table, I have to scroll down severalpages to locate an album. Not to mention the information storedinside the songs is not always accurate. In some languages,the same word can have different codes. Like chinese has Big5and GB, so the same singer published by TaiWan and Mainlandchina will appear under two names! And the two names are notalways together!I had huge problem with iRiver PMP-140. The damn thing automaticallyswitch between play and fast forward, it doesn't play 192 bit.Finally I had to return it.iRiver H10 5GB is a nice product, but a little too expensiveconsidering its small disk size, and it doesn't connect to PCsmoothly, some day it gets connected with no problem, some dayit doesn't, there are weird ways to solve the problem on internet,just google it.iRiver H10 20GB is OK, but transferring songs is super slow,especially on a celeron processor, plus, the battery is notinterchangable, and you can't just plug it in any computerand expect it to be connected -- you need to log in as anadministrator to install software, This is going to be aproblem for people like me who doesn't have administratorprivilege on a office PC.OK, so how do I like this Archos 220? First, the compact flashcard reader is the best! I am a photo enthusiast. I take tonsof photos with my Nikon D70. With gmini 220, I literally takewith me a 20GB harddisk! I can transfer my photos to the Gmini220 anytime I want. Got memory stick? no problem, buy the 4-in-1compact flash card adaptor and you are good to go! Don't trustthe so called "USB-on-the-fly" thing, First you to carry a cableor a card reader with you, second it doesn't work with all cameras,Third, most "USB-on-the-fly" supports only USB1.1 host, the transferspeed is terribly slow. I tried the one on that iRiver PMP-140, itliterally takes 15 seconds to transfer one picture file -- you willprobably run out of battery before you finish transferring files.On my Gmini 220, One 3Mb photo takes less than 1 second. I spent avacation to Vegas and Grand Canyon a few weeks ago, where I took over1GB photos, all photos were transferred to my gmini220 and carriedback safely, no problem at all!I also like the way gmini connects to PC: no software required,no installation, no need to log in as an administrator. When youconnect to a PC, it becomes a hard drive automatically. copyingfiles to 220 is just like copying files from one disk to another.I did have connection problem on one of my older Dell PC, but itconnects perfectly on my all other newer PCs and laptops. Accordingto archos website, they suggest you to upgrade BIOS, I yet to trythat out.It has dual organization methods of your music library. You canbrowse your music files through directory structure, just like whatyou would do on a PC hard drive, or, if you prefer, you can use ARClibrary, which is similar to windows Media player, search your libraryby singer, album etc.The screen of gmini220 is bigger than other MP3 players, although itis black/while, but I found it is very practical, I've never wantedto view my photo or video in a tiny little screen, why do I needa color screen?But as I said, it is not perfect. here are something that I thinkarchos should improve:1 The factory-installed battery really sucks, they should use highercapacity battery and make it interchangable2 There is ZERO customer serivce, they don't reply your email and theirphone line is always busy3 No carrying case, my screen got scratched the 2nd day I got it.4 It's a little bit ugly, not a main issue for guys like me, butprobably your girl friend won't like it.5 If only it is 40GB ...6 It does support Asia languages like Chinese, but you can displyeither GB or Big5, not both. That is annoying but not a disaster,some Big5 characters still gets displayed correctly under GB system(vice verse).Overall I like the gmini 220 and would recommend it to any of my friends.I did hear a lot of complaint about this unit on internet, but strangely,I personally have no problem with mine at all, probably I am lucky? don'tknow, will report later if I encounter problems.

So I ordered another light and if things go as plan I will order a third or fourth light.The base mount is real cheap with plastic threads. Rating it 4 stars.  So you will need to be carful with it.  Since I will be using the lights for table top photography I am not to concerned because it will be free standing on the table or I will rig a better way to mount it to a light stand.I was a little disappointed that nothing was mentioned that it did not come with a battery.

$review_text.: This case is amazing. I got it for my wife's birthday and she loves it. It is a lot easier for her to do her homework now. And people ask her all the time where she got it.  When I bought it I was worried that the keyboard would fall out or something but the keyboard stays in just fine because of the magnet. Also they keyboard's battery lasts over a week on one charge. The only downside is that there aren't more colors. Which is not that big of a deal. It still looks like a solid high quality case. Would recommend to anybody.
$SUMMARY.: Great Case!

$review_text.: Better build quality than the f/1.8 and incredible price point with many of the attributes of the f/1.2 at a fraction of the price - this is my new "go to" lens when I want a lightweight, fast prime.  It isn't the sharpest lens wide open, but stop it down to f/2 (and beyond) and you will be amazed.  Great bokeh combined with fast AF for just over $300?  I call that a deal any day of the week.  As long as you aren't expecting "L-series" results I suspect you'll be pretty pleased with what Canon has to offer.  Add the extension tubes for some incredible macro capability as well.  I really enjoy this lens on my 5D.  Highly recommended!
$SUMMARY.: Incredible bang for the buck from Canon!!

$review_text.: I purchased another folio case for my iPad Mini because it was slightly cheaper. I was happy with that case till I saw the features of the Invellop case and had to have it. It has been a great upgrade to my previous case. Since the magnets holds the cover in place, I feel like I'm using a table let when its folded completely back and I don't have to worry about how I touch the screen when its in viewing mode since it hasn't collapsed on itself.

$review_text.: I sold my Zoom H2 to get the Q3
The Q3 is a step down in audio quality, but it's much simpler to use

I didn't have to look at the manual to make my first audio and video recordings, whereas I liked to have the manual for the H2 handy every time I used it

Windows Movie Maker had no problem with the video files, so I didn't bother to install Zoom's software.Though I haven't tried the other $100 audio recorders from Tascam, Alesis, etc., I suspect this is comparable
Best way to think of the Q3 is as a $100 portable audio recorder that also has a video option
The video is pretty mediocre, so don't buy this as video recorder

It's a great $100 audio recorder though!

$REVIEW.: These are not good if you have to be able to put them on anything....

The diameter of the outside ring is too small and it required bending of the prongs to get these to slide onto a regular RCA female

 This required so much force to slide on I was afraid I was going to break internal connections on the circuit board of the amp I was using them on


 I would not order these again and should have just returned these vs


modifying them to make them work.

$REVIEW.: my default software is able to play the videos that are captured with this unit, so I didn't need to install any additional software of drivers. I just put the card in my card reader and everything is there. You do HAVE to connect the unit to your TV to set it up. There is a built in menu that must be setup before you can use it. You can set it to record all the time or motion sensor. You can even set the times it should record if you know who or what you want to check on. The setup is a little confusing, but not too difficult. Once it's setup, it works really well. I set it up for motion sensing recording. The videos are just OK quality, about like most inexpensive surveillance cameras. If you know who you're looking at, it's easy to make out, sort of like a cell phone video recording.The unit is a little bigger than I expected, so it's not really "hidden". If you have an alarm system in your home, with motion sensors mounted inside, you can mount this and people might think it's just another, larger, sensor.If you're concerned about personal property, or need a nanny cam", this will do the trick. I just think it's expensive for what you get.

$review_text.: Trouble with Wireless app - which is why I purchased this version.Purchase White addition, went though update process and to GoPro app to connect.  Everything worked but after a couple sessions, video preview stopped working.  I could always control camera, but the video preview window never displayed live video after the first day.  After powering off camera, ipod, running app on iPod mini, trying all sorts of reset procedures,  just gave up and had Amazon send me a second unit.I'm updating firmware on this second unit and will advise.The biggest issue I have with the GoPro iOS app is you can't access pictures in SD card.  Had to purchase 3rd party app for $1.99 to download pics from camera to iPod / iPad - and this app requires GoPro App to be on and connected.  So why doesn't GoPro include that feature.  Streaming live video from camera is MUCH harder than downloading images from SD card.  Don't get it.Lets hope this camera works better.----- Update -------------After getting second camera (I love Amazon customer service), video preview works on same iPod and iPad mini.  So the only thing that changed was the camera.  This leads me to believe either the original camera had a hardware issue - OR - the firmware controlling the camera has a bug.  If the problem comes back, then its the latter.  Stay tuned - its only been 1 hour with the new camera.

Perfectly priced!PROS:- Tack sharp! (especially between f/5.6 and f/11 at night!)- lightweight for L glass- non-extended zoom- good zoom range...makes it a versatile walk-around lens during the day- excellent performer on a 1.6x FOVCF body (I used it on the XTi, 10D, 30D, and 40D).  On a full-frame body, I have heard of some vignetting and soft corners when wide open or even close to it.- comes with the hood and bag (although the hood is quite useless on a non-full-frame body)- fast focusingCONS:- hood is useless on a crop sensor...still get some flare

Some people have complainted that it falls forward easily but I think they are just trying to ignore basic physics.

$REVIEW.: In response to Thomas Tracy's review, this drive does have an LED.  It is green and can be seen through the "window" which is also the logo for the flash drive -- a man's face.I also experienced faster write times.  While not using as complex a data set, I was able to transfer large movie files from an external hard drive to this flash drive at about 15 seconds per 100MB.  That's about 2.5 minutes per 1GB.The outer shell is a plastic that may feel flimsy when you hold it, but it should be able to resist most impacts.  Don't put it in your back pocket, but sensitive devices like this should never be sat upon.  The tab that slides the connector in and out must be depressed before it can be moved, so it keeps the connector safe and steady.The capacity and price make this drive a great value.  It has a slot in the end to tie a string or small keychain to.

$review_text.: Well, I did love this micro SD card...that is until it decided to stop working and erase EVERYTHING I had on the card.  I was doing nothing out of the ordinary, just pulled out my phone when standing in line at the bank, when I saw a notification on my phone saying that SD card is damaged and needs to be removed or reset, or something along those lines.  But I did not want to do that because then I would lose everything, not that it mattered, because I lost everything anyways.So I ignored the warning, but that didn't do anything at all.  So then I decided to restart my phone, thinking maybe it was just an error with the phone, or the phone was just acting a little crackers (crazy).  That didn't work either, as the warning again came up onto the screen and was there till stay, at least until I tried the option that it was giving...restarting the damaged card.  So I gave in and did just that, and lost everything on the card and the card went dead.  It was inside the phone, but the phone was not picking it up and registering it as a working card.So basically I was just out of luck and could nothing about it, and could not retrieve the pictures and whatever else I had on the card.  I don't know what when wrong, but from now on I am backing everything up and making sure this does not happen again, as you can imagine that i was not very happy with the situation.But all was not bad with the product...I did like the card before it decided to quit working, and I am sure that this does not happen to everyone, but I got the (un)lucky draw.

In the past I have had ...ahem...

frustration putting such things on devices- to the point where some have been thrown in the trash

 The directions are clear, the product itself is expertly cut, and it went right on! ( Yup, no swearing , demands for a martini, or suggestions of "will this do?")I thought the inclusion of the back skin was nice as well-- but it is the front that works the magic.Fingerprints do seem to fade, and this one does not need the constant wiping off that others do.WELL worth your consideration!

$review_text.: As other reviewers have mentioned, these are great headphones for gaming
 They are advertised as "for gaming and music" which is true, but in all honesty they should be used sparingly for music


 The stock Apple earbuds output better music quality than these puppies (and that's not saying much!)
 Gaming on the other hand is quite a different story

 Shooters, racing games, and everything in between all sound fantastic and you can't beat the noise cancellation offered by earbuds
 There is also a microphone to make chatting with your friends while in a multiplayer game very easy (this was a huge plus for me, since I just changed from a laptop to a desktop and shortly therafter realized I had no way to chat!)Overall, given the poor music quality, I can't really see these as being priced above the $75-$80 mark


 Yet they are going for $130 here on Amazon, which seems a bit crazy to me for what you get here

 At the $130 price point, you'd be better buying yourself a $5 microphone and a $125 pair of "good" earbuds that can be used for both music and gaming
 I'm sure the price will come down over time, but in the meantime I would really suggest that you evaluate your alternatives.

$review_text.: A few minor cons:1. For some reason they used a micro usb port instead of a mini usb (micro usb is mostly used for phones where space is very limited). Most of us have mini usb cables lying everywhere. But micro usb is less common.2. The port is VERY tight, you need to use an excessive amount of force to plug in the cable. The cable also doesn't go all the way in, it goes in about 3/4 of the way. Also, the port itself is kind of loose. The connection with the cable is very tight, but the connection to the drive is kind of loose. Makes it feel like it usb port will break after more uses.3. The usb cable is very short about 1 foot.4. Formated as NTFS, had to reformat to FAT so MAC and linux can write to it.But overall, it's a pretty good drive. Actually shows up as 750GB in Disk Util on a Mac (don't know about windows...).

$review_text.: Since this item has been reviewed pretty extensively, I'll just summarize my likes and dislikes when it comes to the Belkin FastFit Bluetooth Keyboard with cover:Like:* Good keys, nice tactile response, decent size for an iPad-sized keyboard.* Easy pairing, no trouble getting it to work.* Attractive as a screen cover
Matches the back of the iPad.* Magnetic latch is pretty cool.* Multiple grooves allow multiple positions.* Battery life is excellent.Dislike:* Provides zero protection for back of iPad, and not very accommodating to various types of back protection.* Doesn't actually secure the iPad into the groove, like the Logitech version does.* Provides no actual connection between iPad and keyboard/case

Someone could just walk by and grab your iPad easily in public while you're typing.* Keyboard layout is a bit strange, and really not made for touch-typists; Most notably the tiny right-shift key.* Belkin doesn't advertise a back protector to go with this, making the quest to protect the iPad's back a blind one.* A little bit on the heavy side when compared to other keyboard cases.My overall impression is that this is a great idea, but Belkin fell short of what I'd like to see in a keyboard case like this
I adore the actual keyboard, but without anything to protect the back of the iPad, and no suggestions from Belkin about how best to go about this (i.e., what back covers would be compatible with the FastFit), I feel less secure using this to travel because a slip could mean my iPad hits the ground with no protection on one whole side
It also means the iPad is vulnerable to scratches from normal use.I think any keyboard screen cover like this should come standard with some form of back protection
The reviews for Belkin's own back protector (which may or may not be compatible with the FastFit) are terrible, but at least if Belkin included it with the FastFit, I'd have something to keep my iPad safe on both sides


One-sided protection doesn't really impress me; Especially when the side being protected is the sturdier Gorilla Glass side, and not the vulnerable aluminum side.Will I use it? Sure, from time to time at home I think I might..


But I'm not eager to go out in public with this thing as the only protection for my iPad


It's just not enough.Three stars for general build quality and the nice keyboard keys

I docked two stars out of the five total for the "don't like" reasons above.UPDATE: I picked up the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover, and for those wondering how the Belkin compares..

Well, I hate to be unkind, but the Belkin is bulkier, doesn't attach magnetically to the iPad when in landscape view, and doesn't have the nifty magnetic connection at the hinge like a Smart Cover


In short, Logitech simply out-thought Belkin on this one

It doesn't mean the Belkin is bad by any means, but that when compared to the Logitech it just falls short in key areas that Logitech nailed


HOWEVER, the Logitech is typically thirty bucks more expensive than the Belkin, so if you're on a budget the Belkin's a great alternative to the Logitech Ultrathin

If you can swing the extra cash, though, you may want to compare them before jumping in.

 I get to revitalize my long-neglected German skills with Euronews and Tageschau, and found another free channel that gives me streaming European radio content


 And there are so many "niche" channels, both public and private, available for foreign programming, sports, politics, and other interests.All I recommend to anyone contemplating a Roku is this--get an antenna for your local channels or cut your cable back to absolute basic

 It has a tremendous sound; both treble and bass

 I've tried a number of small, portable speakers and this one beats them all and is a great price too


 I don't see how anyone could be disappointed in this product


 The stereo cord is quite short so I bought a retractable 3.5mm extender from eBay to carry with it.

$review_text.: Great quality, simple, yet effective holder for your TV not to be tipped off. All hardware included. Worth the $15 without a doubt. Very strong - you just need to mount it into the stud in your wall or with good enough hardware holders if you don't have an option for solid studs in your walls. It's designed to fit perfectly with a Sanus furniture but you can accommodate it with any furniture or if it's not possible - just drill both holes in your wall and fix it that way. I did it for extra stability. I'm very happy with this belt and highly recommend it.

$review_text.: If you are considering these headphones, please be aware that plasma TVs can cause interference that will basically render them useless.I found this out only after setting up the headphones and discovering annoying static. While reading the owner's manual, I found a small entry in there about possible interference from plasma "displays," meaning TVs or monitors. Sure enough, when I turned off the TV but left the program playing via the cable box, the noise disappeared. So if you don't need to see what's actually on the TV, they work fine!I returned these headphones with a note to Amazon that this little tidbit should be more prominently mentioned before some other poor sap wastes their time setting them up only to have to return them.The headphones themselves seem to be fine as long as you don't plan to use them with a plasma TV. The construction and comfort were decent, the buttons were easy to use and the docking system for charging worked as described.My only complaint is the plasma problem not being mentioned on Amazon's item description page, which is why I gave a 1-star rating. I think anyone not using a plasma TV will probably find no problem with the headphones.

The cover locks in place which is nice as I can trust it and do not have to worry about anything shorting it out.

They're fairly flexible, but the teeth are harder than the body of the belt, which translates to less slipping when cranking on the follow focus.

$REVIEW.: Well that was a waste of 30 bucks. When I put this in my new Nikon D5200 I get a message that says "This memory card cannot be used. Insert another card." I tried two other cards and they work fine.UPDATE: I put the card in a card reader to see if it was recognized. It was but it was full of strange files of odd characters. I formatted it with my PC in NTFS and after that the camera recognized the card and instructed me to reformat it. After I did this the card seems to be working fine.UPDATE: My camera has an intermittent problem of suddenly displaying a black review screen while shooting. The camera is functioning fine but this black screen issue can go on for quite some time before the camera recovers. When I move those images to my PC they are indeed black. I have returned my camera and lens for an exchange. When I get the replacement kit I'll try this card again and see if it was the problem and not the camera or lens. I'll report back.UPDATE: Before I sent the camera and lens off for exchange I tried a Sandisk 32GB card. I got through about 150 pics before I got the black screen issue. So to be fair this card was not the problem. I give it 3 stars because it's got a nice price and seems to work OK in my camera. But, mine was formatted with some odd file system when it arrived and my camera could not recognize it until I formatted on the PC first. That's ridiculous.

Period.Ipods need not apply.I've got mine running from software (Foobar2000 with digital eq, four-channel converter, and Dolby surround headphone listening room wrapper plug-ins) to a high quality pc soundcard, then through a OP2132 OpAmp, and I'm still not convinced I'm getting everything I can out of them. Heart's "Dreamboat Annie" disc never sounded better.I can't stress enough that whether you call it a virtue or a weakness, these phones WILL NOT lend a faux-audiophile sound to run-of-the-mill gear, like some modern phones will.

$review_text.: I have used these Verbatim brand 16X disks in both my DMR-EH50S Panasonic DVD Recorder (recording content from the television to its hard drive and then after editing the content, burning it to DVD media) as well as my pc computer's NEC ND-3500AG 16X DVD burner and all I can say is how pleased I have been.These burn very very fast at 16X and I have not had any failures using them -- absolutely no errors so far!I have used other popular brands of 16X speed DVD media including Taiyo Yuden, Philips, Maxell, Memorex, TDK and while those also have burned very dependably (with a few exceptions) there is one capability I have noticed that the Verbatim brand possesses that those other brands do not. And that is I can squeeze more video and file content onto these Verbatim disks whereas with those other brands I cannot! There is a little more storage space on these! That has made a difference at critical moments in which I needed to fit those extra few megabytes onto the same disk.I am on my third 25 disk spindle and undoubtedly will opt for the 100 disk spindle when the time comes to replenish my supply.I have decided that I won't use any of those other brands until either the manufacturing quality of these changes for the worse or they stop making them altogether -- I hope neither happens.Anyway, these are as near to perfection for burning video and files onto as I have been able to find and I recommend them to you heartily!

This is the finest quality monitor I have owned and I've had several since the late 80s
The picture quality is outstanding out of the box using the Window's 7 drivers, I can only imagine how much better it would be with Dell device drivers which are available from the enclosed documentation disk or the latest version from their website

I have used all three hardware adjustments to fit my viewing area and will be looking at the user's guide to decrease the brightness a little as it appears to be too bright for me

$review_text.: Only 20 pounds, and I had this unpacked and plugged in in under two minutes.  The stand is the most impressive I've seen.  Easy to mount the screen (one click).  Tilts and swivels easily, but stops when you want.  One thumb to release the height adjustment, and the counterbalance makes it easy...as well as the molded-in handle at the top-rear of the chassis.Strangely, with HDMI out from my laptop, I could only get about the center 2/3rds of the screen to work.  The pixels were there (1920x1200) confirmed by the dimensions of a screen capture, but the display was scaling it down (bad jagged edges) and shrinking it to only part of the screen.  Switched to an HDMI->DVI cable, and it worked fine.  Not sure what the problem is, as HDMI works fine with a 26" Samsung with the same resolution (and carries audio).  Head scratcher, but not a deal breaker.  I already had the cable, so no money was spent.  Moving on.I Threw the color calibrator on it right away.  No retouch artist should ever consider using manual adjustments or working with factory defaults.  Manual adjustments on monitors went out with those giant 100-pounders that left heat marks on the walls.  No more fiddling with keystone, rotation, convergence or clicking through endless menus.  It's a computer--use it!  I used only two manual settings on the monitor: factory reset & color temperature.COLOR: Without calibration, there is a little bit of brightness and magenta/purple hue.  Should be no issues for general office work right out of the box.  Calibration with a Spyder3 Elite knocked off that harshness.  Light ouput was 314 candelas uncalibrated, 302 calibrated. My notebook calibrates to 280.  The datacolor software (Spyder3Elite) has methods to adjust multiple monitors closely.  Could backfire, as my laptop has a harsh LED backlight...I don't want to adjust the HP down to its level.The color gamut is suprisingly close to NTSC...it's footprint is actually larger than the NTSC and AdobeRGB spaces, but doesn't include all of them.  This LP2475 tests far better than the Apple Cinema HD display that it's replacing.  The A1082, while pretty, can't even cover the sRGB space...barely better than my laptop driving it.  The sRGB color space footprints lie well within the boundaries of the LP2475.HEAT:  With the spec at 75-120W, it's less heat than a desktop.  In comparison, the A1082 has a 90W spec.  Both are about the same amount of heat that comes out of either of my laptops, which have 90W and 150W power supplies.  When I'm not working in Photoshop, the GPU is running BOINC...so there's always heat.  The monitor's top vents seem to be moving the heat just fine.  Front screen is warm to touch, but nothing is hot.  This isn't a thin monitor by any means...but I didn't get it for a useless trendy look.UNIFORMITY: %-ages are above the center reading.  Similar to other monitors, the top is brighter than the bottom (8.6-16.0% versus 6.2-9.4%).  Right side is brighter than the left (8.6-16.0% versus 0.5-8.6%).  For imaging (medical, sattelite, etc.) I imagine this is a problem.  These variances are not terribly noticeable yet.  Considering the variations exist in two other LCD screens that I currently use during re-touch...I'm not surprised or disappointed.  Better would be better, but for the price...it's already head and shoulders above the old $1000 monitor I just disconnected.Overall, I'm impressed by the price tag and ease to install.  We'll see how it performs in the long run.

I've tried universal remotes in the past and they've always let me down by either not supporting one of my devices, or not supporting every button I need.The list of supported devices/brands is surprising, and you can customize buttons - change the behavior of buttons or add your own to the LCD screen.You can even make different buttons for different activities (when you're watching a DVD you have certain custom buttons, when watching TV, different ones)My only complaint about the product is the software used to set it up. You have to go through a "wizard" to do anything. In one or two instances, the wizard made me make changes that I didn't want to, in order to modify one particular setting. It's very easy to use, but if you're more advanced it can be frustrating.this dropped it from 5 stars to 4.

$review_text.: I just received the hub but cannot tell if it works as well as others say because of two very big problems.1

The AC adapter is HUGE!  It is over twice as big as the hub

Not sure what IOGEAR was thinking but the adapter covers BOTH sockets on the wall plug and will NOT fit in my power strip at all
To complicate matters, the cord is only about 4 feet long (instead of the standard 6 feet on other products).2


The USB 3.0 cable is extremely SHORT!  It measures a mere 39 inches

The distance from my USB 3.0 card in the computer to my desktop is about 5 feet
 Now I have to wait to find either a longer cable or a USB 3.0 extension cable before I can even use this hub.Sadly, most companies today may still make good products but then cut corners by using cheap OEM cords and cables to save money
If I can get this to work, I will use it but I will think twice before buying an IOGEAR product again

 You should do the same
If you decided to purchase this hub, be sure to buy an extension cord and extra long USB 3.0 cable.

$review_text.: The 70-300 G is definitely one of the least expensive lenses to get you to 300 mm, but there are some tradeoffs with the low price tag.  I've found my lens to be pretty soft throughout the zoom range (mine is soft even stopped down) and relatively slow to focus (D70).  The lens performs best in well lit environments and is capable of taking high quality pictures, but may require more post processing and effort than faster lenses to achieve these results.I bought the lens mainly to get the zoom range at an affordable price, but plan to replace it in the near future (probably will sell the lens).  The build quality isn't the best, but it is still pretty durable.  Recommended for beginning photographers or photographers on a budget (like myself), but others may be left wanting more.  Still, it is sold at a great price.

$review_text.: Update 1/13/2014: I have had to contact Ceton again. It seems that the 1.4A USB adapter used to power the Ceton is flakey. Using my Kindle power adapter works more reliably than the one that came with it. Ceton has been notified and I'm guessing they'll send me another Adapter.There is definitely some lag when going through the Ceton to access the programming compared to accessing the content natively. This is particularly apparent when navigating the menus and between programs. Everything is connected via gigabit Ethernet.Previous review:When I first received this unit it did not work but Ceton's support team contacted me quickly and after downloading a tool to re-flash the firmware over USB it was up and running. Connecting to my home theater PC Windows Media Center was quite easy and it works well for showing remote content. I was also able to quickly upgrade it to the latest firmware. I love how small the unit is and the white logo is nice. It's not too bright and not the harsh blue that seems to be so popular today.It is a little slow in responding to the remote but I suspect this is just the nature of the remote interface it provides.My only real complaint is that I wish it also had an analog stereo output since I plan to use an old receiver I have in my bedroom since the HDMI monitor has such poor audio. I got a TOS to stereo adapter (B00F4ORTZ6) that did not work with the Ceton however I got an HDMI audio extractor that works quite well ( B00AHS8LD8 ).I have also had problems when hooking up a wireless USB keyboard. The Echo frequently crashes and restarts when I attempt to use it.My previous review was:I just got it today. It seems to be dead on arrival. When I hook it up the Ceton logo in front and the digital optical audio connector in back light up but I get nothing out the HDMI port and do not see any DHCP activity from the network port. My father has the same unit and likes it, but it looks like mine is defective.

$REVIEW.: I completely &#34;cut the cable&#34; in my home over a year ago - an indoor HDTV antenna and Roku 2 provide pretty much all I need for streaming and viewing content. At that time, I used a Mohu Leaf antenna and wanted to give the Amazon Basics a try for a second TV set. Set up took all of two minutes - plug the cable into the Antenna port on the TV, place the antenna near a window and start a channel scan. Once the scan finished, I was receiving crisp, clear reception on roughly 60 channels. I do live in a metropolitan area (Washington, DC) and from my prior experience, knew I would be able to receive a wide variety of programming. I will be trying this out in a second location further from DC and update my review at that time. But in a nutshell, this works every bit as well as the Mohu Leaf and is the antenna I prefer because of its extra long cable. If you are thinking about cutting the cable yourself, I highly recommend the Amazon Basics Ultra Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna. No need to spend money unnecessarily on anything else - spend it on some nice peripherals instead. This is all you need.

$REVIEW.: I love these speakers. I was looking for something to replace my bulky tower speakers but could still deliver the power. It was between these and the Martin Logan mini system. Even though the Martin Logans were cheaper I choose these because of their more modern look and the smaller size. My only complaint was that the bass isn't ground shaking. But come on; what do you expect from a 8 in sub. This was easily fixed by switching out the sub with a Klipsch rw-12d. Combined with the Klipsch sub I get compliments all the time on my system. I made good use of the Energy sub by putting it in my bedroom system. The Energy sub has a much tighter sounding bass and is not as boomy. I prefer this nicer sounding bass for easy listening. The klipsch is for blasting movies and music with furniture shaking bass.

$review_text.: I've spent money buying cheap cables in order to avoid the &#34;apple tax&#34; on their cables, only to realize that a lot of the non MFi (made for iPhone) cables are junk. So you're better off just buying a MFi cable. And since the 6' cable is half the price of the Apple branded cable, it's worth buying.I've used it on both my iPad Mini and my iPhone 5s without issues and without any nags that I normally get when I use a cheap power cable. The downside of this cable is that the Lightning adapter is wider than the Apple cable, so it makes it difficult to plug into the phone. I've tried a few cases for my iPhone, and it's a bit frustrating because I feel like I'm forcing the device and the cable on each other. To me, this is a major issue and shaving that connector down somehow to allow better connection to the device would make this a killer cable.Overall, the Lightning cable from AmazonBasics is pretty decent, however, the thickness at the end of the cable might cause it to be worthless depending on your case for your iDevice. For that, I'm giving this 3.5 stars overall - fix the wide end on the Lightning cable, and you have a winner.

However, you can also configure it in numerous ways, so it makes up for it.FYI - I was able to mount it above the TV with the wires going down through the channel, despite all of the picutres and instructions only showing it below a TV.After getting the first one for the living room, I ordered another for the bedroom. I suppose I found it to be such a pain because I had to mount them 10 feet in the air while standing on a ladder. The overly complex mounting procedure is really bad for trying to do that.

$review_text.: Just buy it! If you are looking at this, you probably have a scratched or unreadable disc, right? If so, buy it now. Do not keep reading, put it in your cart and wait for it to come. When it comes, follow the easy directions and in about 5 minutes, your kids will think you are a hero! I just fixed 4 more games (guests came over and the kids were a little wild and really scratched up the discs). I still have a ton more liquid left. I now do it one time, then try the game out. Usually, once is enough. On my daughters Lego Harry Potter game, I indeed had to do it twice. Mind you, this disc was completely unreadable. Put it in and the console said the disc was unreadable.......not any more! What else can I say? You could even charge to repair discs and make a nifty little side business repairing peoples discs....while they wait! I love this!!!So my kids scratched up a few video games, Wii and Xbox 360! The scratches on Super Mario Bros. for the Wii were not too bad and after my first try the game played. The kids were thrilled, and so was I. Baja 1000 and Call Of Duty for the 360 were also scratched up. COD game back with no problem as well. Baja 1000 was a different story. Those scratches were bad! My nephew came over and started to spin the disc in the holder and created some pretty good scratches....well, I did it 4 times and guess what...it worked. The disc itself doesn't look that great, but as long as it works I don't really care what it looks like. I couldn't be happier with this product. I suspect if the scratches are too deep there is nothing you can do, however, I have saved 3 great games! I am very happy. FYI, I did not turn the handle quickly and took my time. I followed the directions exactly as written.

$REVIEW.: I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side


They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap

I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable

I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine


Aftera break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time


And htat's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money

Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass

The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony)
And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads

I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time


Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables

Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups


They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price


4 stars.

$REVIEW.: This baby is solid steel. I could hang from it.Make sure you find the center of your studs and predrill the holes.  Use soap, wax, or Chapstick on the bolts as you screw them into the studs. Don't crack your studs. Pre-drill just the right size. If the bolts are too difficult to install, drill just a little larger. Don't drill out too much or they bolts could pull out of the wall.On the TV make sure the bracket isn't pressing in on the TV. If so, Add washers so that the brackets are away from the TV, so that there is a gap between the mounts and the TV.In my bedroom I mount it high so that it is easy to view from a lying position in bed. In the family room I mount it so that my eyes are about 1/3 or 1/5 of the way up the screen. Some people mount them waaaaaay tooooo high.

$REVIEW.: Just got this unit in, and so far, works quite nicely on my iMac running OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion). Special thanks to to reviewer  Dick Guertin "Dickster" (who had very good info on running this on a Mac), and reviewer sunman42 (who mentioned in a comment to my review that it also works in OS X 10.9 - Mavericks). I did not bother with the instructions, and the CD coming with it is useless for Mac.Briefly, hook up the player via USB, download Audacity 2.0.5 (free), change Mac System Preferences - Sound - Input - to "USB PnP Audio Device". In Audacity, go to the Transport tab and turn off Overdub, and turn on Software Playthrough (can also be changed under Audacity - Preferences - Recording).When playing your tape, press the round red "recording" button in the Audacity window; without pressing it I couldn't hear the playback. When song is finished, press the square brown "stop" button. To save the recorded song, go to File - export - and name your file and format (I used AIFF for Mac). Once saved to my desktop, I then delete the recording from Audacity by clicking the 'X' beside Audio Track in the Audacity window. I haven't played around with all the filters and effects yet. I converted only around 20 songs so far, so cannot judge longevity of the unit yet.For now, I give it 5 stars, since the unit is inexpensive, plays my tapes without problems so far, and I was ready to record in 5 minutes (with the helpful info from the other reviewer mentioned above).

$REVIEW.: This Magellan GPS is not a bad GPS. Indeed, for someone who has never used a GPS before, this might be a pleasant experience. But for the past two or three years, I have used a Garmin GPS. And compared to the Garmin, the Magellan is an exercise in frustration.Let's just start from the beginning.Satellite connection:This thing took an inordinate amount of time to connect to the satellite signals when I first started it up. I don't know if this is because it was searching the entire world for the correct satellites, or what, but all the Garmin GPS devices I have used ask you to input your initial position manually, probably so that it doesn't have to go searching the entire sky to figure out which satellites to use and where you are. It took so long to connect, in fact, that I thought I had received a faulty unit.On subsequent startups, the connection was much quicker, but still not as fast as my two-year-old Garmin.Entering addresses:Typing in your destination address is a bad experience. Why? Well, as you type each letter, the Magellan tries to figure out which street you are talking about. This is fine, but as soon as it figures out -- or thinks it figures out -- what street you probably mean, it jumps to a screen of street name suggestions. This would be fine if it paused briefly before accepting new input. But it doesn't, and so fast typists like me will inevitably choose a street or city without seeing what we have selected, because we are still typing the name. Then you have to go back and start again.In comparison, the Garmin throws in a slight one second delay before allowing you to choose the intended street name from its list of suggestions. This prevents any accidental input.Navigation:Okay, this is a big one. The Magellan's navigation algorithms are, for want of a better word, funky. I had the machine set to give me the fastest, rather than the shortest, route. However, its alleged fastest route is almost never the actual fastest route. This is a huge problem, essentially negating one of the main benefits of a GPS. I know how to get to a lot of places around town in a roundabout way, but presumably a GPS is able to calculate the most direct route. However, as I entered in destinations into the Magellan, I was shocked and annoyed to find that its fastest route was always several minutes longer than the Garmin's fastest route. (For comparison's sake, I was often using the Magellan and the Garmin at the same time.)The Garmin always knew what it was doing. When I entered in an address across town, the Garmin usually told me to take the freeway (specifically, I 66), and would give me its estimated time of arrival. The Magellan, however, wanted me to take an odd, non-freeway route, with an estimated time of arrival of several minutes longer than the Garmin's calculation. I double-checked the Magellan's settings to make sure that freeways were enabled, and indeed they were. For some reason, the Magellan simply wasn't using them. When I decided to take the Garmin's advice, the Magellan eventually recalculated the route, and now that it was on the freeway, it gave me an updated time of arrival -- several minutes shorter than its original so-called fastest time.The Magellan's fastest time calculations are simply wrong. I know this not just from my experimental observations, but also because it has a neat feature where you can see a screen listing the estimated time of arrival using its various different navigation settings: fastest time, shortest route, etc. Frequently, it's "fastest time" was actually longer than the rest of the navigation options. This makes absolutely no sense and is indicative of a bug in the navigation algorithms.Voice guidance:Had I never used a Garmin GPS, I would have thought the Magellan's voice guidance was perfectly adequate. However, with the Magellan and the Garmin sitting next to each other, both trying to explain what to do next, the differences -- and the shortcomings of the Magellan -- were obvious. The Magellan's computerized voice was stilted, and nowhere as natural sounding as the Garmin. The Magellan would say something like, "Right Turn, Point Five Miles, Harrison Street." The Garmin would say, "In Point Five Miles, Turn Right on Harrison Street."Voice guidance on freeways was even worse, a crying shame considering the high speeds at which one drives on the freeway. You should not have to use any brainpower to decipher what the GPS is trying to tell you, and yet the Magellan required some concentration and decoding. It would bombard you with various route and exit numbers, giving you far more information than you need to take the next exit, and rattling off that information without natural pauses. It was frustrating.Freeway navigation theoretically should have been made more pleasing than the Garmin by the addition of Magellan's interesting sounding Exit Sign Technology. This feature allows you to display the various green freeway signs on the screen of your Magellan, highlighting the sign that you want to follow. This is supposed to be easier than just listening to the voice telling you which exit to take. But it really just adds confusion, as I have to stare at the different reproduced signs, (which are not actual pictures of the real highway signs, by the way, but just generic green highway signs that usually look nothing like the real signs), and try to figure out what it wants me to do. Again, this just requires more brainpower and makes it more likely that I will get confused at 80 mph and miss an exit.And the Magellan's timing was off. Timing on a GPS is a very subtle, yet important feature. The GPS has to be able to tell you when to turn at different times depending on what speed you are going, how far ahead the turn is, whether you're going to need to switch lanes quickly to make the turn, etc. Garmin's programmers got this right; Magellan's didn't. Again, this is something that I might not even have realized had I only been using the Magellan, and had I never used a Garmin. But, having had a successful GPS experience for years, the deficiencies in the Magellan's voice and timing algorithms were evident.Display:The navigation display colors are horrible. I don't know if the Magellan engineers had never used any other GPS devices, or did not focus group their display, but the colors they chose to delineate roads and routes are completely nonsensical. During the day, in order to indicate the routes to take, the Magellan highlights your suggested roads in a light yellowish green line, which is displayed over a slightly darker yellowish green background. At night, the color scheme is not much better. Now, my eyes are fine. I am in my late 20s and I can generally see things on a LCD monitor with no problem, and yet I had trouble seeing which roads were actually highlighted.The Garmin gets this right. It overlays a bright pink line against a gray background during the day, and a dark blue background at night. This is much easier to see. There are never any questions over whether or not a road is actually highlighted. I always know where I'm supposed to go.It is really ironic that the Magellan, which has an amazingly clear and bright LCD screen, would be so inferior in this area to my old clunky Garmin with its faded screen. But because of the questionable choice of colors, the Garmin crushes it.Does the Magellan have any pros?Sure. As I said, it has a beautiful screen. It is generally a fast machine (except for connecting to the satellite, sometimes). Its navigation interface, although cluttered, gives you quicker one touch access to destinations than the Garmin does. This is handy when on the highway, for instance -- it takes two taps to see the list of nearest gas stations (Where to, Gas), compared to four taps on the Garmin (Menu, Where to, Food/Fuel/Etc., Gas Stations). The Garmin is less cluttered, but it takes longer to wade through its many submenus. Finally, the Magellan's standard closing phrase ("You have ARRIVED!") sounds far cooler than the Garmin's ho-hum "Now arriving."Bottom line:My two-year-old Garmin GPS is a far superior device to this brand-new Magellan. Had I never known the Garmin, I would be satisfied with the Magellan. But I know what a GPS device is capable of. I simply cannot use the Magellan because it is incredibly frustrating and gets a lot of things, most notably navigation calculations, very wrong.My advice? Look at Amazon's list of best selling GPS devices. The crowd is rarely wrong, and in this case the crowd and I both agree: If you want to get somewhere, Garmin is the way to go.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this laptop stand for a completely unintended purpose, and it works great for my need! A few weeks ago I got my first pen tablet for photo editing. But I do this on the couch often with my laptop, so I needed to elevate the tablet to the correct height. The CushTop provides the perfect height, with a surface that keeps the tablet in place, and the slight incline provides a natural angle for my arm. I have the Wacom Bamboo tablet, and this stand is a little oversized, but not too bad. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a similar solution.

$review_text.: True, there may be some initial sticker shock when you first see the price of Bose's Bluetooth wireless Soundlink speaker but after spending some quality time with this device the benefits and quality should override any lingering pangs of buyer's remorse.It's important to keep in mind exactly what this device is - a wireless, portable, mini speaker that syncs up to your ipod, smartphone, etc to give you deep, rich room-filling sound in your location of choice


 If you've used similar products in the past there's only so much range and volume to be expected from small, wireless speakers but with the Soundlink (and depending on the source and quality of your music files) I'm still often caught by surprise at the volume range and sound quality that this speaker is able to reproduce

 Music sounds really good on this with buttery bass and an overall fullness to the sound that must be experienced


 Of course, you may want to play around with the EQ settings on your device (I mostly use a iPhone 4s and keep the EQ settings 'off') to find your preferred sound and you should pay heed to the placement of your speaker as some locales and spots will improve or degrade the overall sound.Setting the device up couldn't be easier with a simple 1 button bluetooth pairing process and once that's taken care of you're all set to put this baby to work

 My only nitpick is the weight of this device

 Sized slightly longer and thicker than a kraft mac and cheese box the weight really sticks out (about 3-4 lbs) but that's to be expected considering the 4 speaker drivers packed into this little box
 Battery life seems good (approx 6-8 hours) and is dependent on the overall volume that audio is played back at


 I've used this device in a variety of settings such as my kitchen, bedroom, hotels, conference rooms and outdoor bbq's and picnics - it has performed well in all situations and impressed those who have experienced it.

$review_text.: I haven't had a lot of opportunity to use this, yet, but from what I can tell, it is a good, sturdy tripod. It folds up to a very compact size and is light, but sturdy. I do think the telescoping legs are kind of annoying, as each segment has to be loosened and retightened on each leg. That is five segments per leg, 15 in total. As such, setting this up is not a fast process. Other than that, it seems like a very good tripod for the price.

$REVIEW.: I love this remote


Its great for my tv set up because I only have a few pieces of hardware (tv, audiio system and cable box)


I got tired of having to turn all 3 on with 3 different remotes and then having two remotes, one to turn the channel and the other to turn the volume up on my stereo
 This remote solves all of the problems

Plus its great when my parents come over to babysit, i tell them to just one one button and it turns everything on.

$REVIEW.: The part appears to be very cheaply made. There was a milky/wax like substance on the board (almost like dust had settled) and when I picked up the board to install it, an attachment pin fell right off. I put it back on and turned the board over to see some of the most shoddy soldering I have ever seen. Big "globs" on the board and totally uneven. I'm not sure how this is called "new" when it was obviously patched and fixed at some point. The overall feel of the board is cheap. It has been installed and is working so far, but if I had this to do again I would have gone with a supplier with better quality parts.

$review_text.: Overall, I like this gizmo--for audio only.  I enjoy listening to music and podcasts on my Nano--fabulous sound quality!  And I like the light weight, under 1.5 ounces, so it's great to use when walking, exercising, or doing housework.  However, these middle-aged eyes don't want to squint at a tiny little screen to view photos or an addressbook, or play games.  Even before I needed reading glasses, I would have found the screen unpleasantly small for viewing anything other than the menu and the name of the song that was playing.  BTW, I like the fact that the Nano was simple to set up and use right out of the box.  Another feature I especially like is that you can pre-set the maximum volume so you don't accidentally blast your eardrums (which happened to me with a previous generation iPod.)Like all Apple products, the iPod Nano is overpriced.  Want to be able to recharge the batteries so you can use the device more than a few days?  You need to buy a power supply separately, and Apple's is $29.  (Several companies sell cheaper power supplies for iPods, both electrical and car chargers.)  And speaking of charging the battery, it would be nice to have an indicator on the screen telling you approximately how much battery power you have left.  Want a docking station?  You have to buy it separately.  Want FM radio with your iPod?  There's a gizmo that provides this, for a separate charge.For some reason, the 8 GB Nano only comes in 2 colors:  red and black, as opposed to the 4 GB Nano, which comes in 5 colors.  If you're paying for more disk space, why not have a choice of more colors?  I'm happy with basic black, however.  And not needing to have my entire music collection on one device, I'm happy with an 8 GB Nano, rather than nearly quadrupling the weight for a regular iPod.  I saw no reason to get the Shuffle (which holds 1/8th of the songs of this Nano), when the Nano is so light.In short, I think the product is overpriced, but I enjoy it so much, I'm glad I forked over the money for it.
$SUMMARY.: Overpriced, but I'm glad I bought it.

$REVIEW.: I originally had the 16 gb but sold that to a friend due to my dislike of the limited space, and I bought this 32 gb right after. This device is AMAZING. It does everything you need a tablet to do from watching videos, downloading all kinds of apps, listening to music, surfing the web, reading books, and most of all TAKING NOTES.My laptop has been gathering dust for a long time now since I got the Note 10.1. I use it on a daily basis for all sorts of tasks from balancing my checkbook to taking notes to playing games and even word processing.The word processing is a bit of a headache on any device without a good quality physical keyboard. I bought a Logitech keyboard for Android and now even word processing is a breeze on this (especially with good applications like Kingsoft, PowerWriter, and the built-in Polaris). You really can't go wrong with this device. It easily beats out the iPad (which I also own, the third generation) in everything except perhaps display (which is better on the iPad). The multi-tasking is just plain ridiculous on the Note 10.1 (ridiculous as in amazing -- sorry for the slang). You get Android 4.0 on the device initially, and that allows for multi-tasking. But when you update your software to the Jellybean version (4.1, I believe), you feel almost like you're on a computer. For a number of apps, you can use split screen, resize windows, etc. The other day I was able to keep open my Lecture Notes app (for handwriting notes), my Polaris app (for viewing documents), my calculator, a music player, and I'm still able to open more like movies, and YouTube and an Web browser! And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows. You can even close out one or more windows (either individually or all at once) with a simple swipe or tap.Then it also comes with dual speakers so if you don't have earphones, you can still easily hear the video or music you're listening to. It's so easy to watch videos and movies and shows on it in landscape with those speakers when you're with company. Also, let's not forget its main feature: The S-Pen! Another amazing innovation by Samsung. This is especially useful for students, artists, and business people. You can write as though you were using a pen and paper. You might wonder the usefulness of it, but trust me, you can do so much on a tablet with that kind of capability. It comes built in with photoshop which I don't use but everyone I know seems to rave over...and the S-Pen seems to be a natural tool for this app. For apps that I use like S-Note, the ability to type something and then draw an illustration or a chart or write out an equation/formula saves me so much time and effort. The handwriting recognition is also one of those features that when you try it you, you'll wonder how the heck did you live without it?Going from this to the iPad was a major step down. I own both and use both, but this is a far superior machine with far superior functions. I personally think that this is not only the best Android tablet out there currently, but that it is better than any tablet so far ever made. This device not only makes things like gaming, movies, etc. possible and enjoyable, but goes a step further by making the tablet a serious tool for actual work like writing and note-taking and editing images, etc.While I can go on and on about how much I love the tablet and how great it is compared to the competition with all its features and capabilities, there are going to be some drawbacks naturally as no device is perfect. The battery life is good, but that's because I rarely take it off Power Saving mode and only occasionally type on it. The built-in S-note is limited to some extent in that it doesn't carry with it other useful features found in ordinary word processors like word count. As a handwriting app, it's great, but I find myself using Lecture Notes more (a couple of bucks on the Play store) because the size of each page on the latter as well as the ability to customize between college ruled or wide ruled (or blank) makes it feel more like paper when writing notes completely by hand. Accessories don't seem to be anywhere near as common (if a lot even exist) for this device as for the competition especially as for the iPad. Keyboard cases designed for the Note 10.1 are horrible made-in-China products that work only barely and are not suitable for fast and/or accurate typing. Even Samsung's keyboard dock for this device doesn't even exist in the US as of yet, and if you're in the States and want to buy one, it looks like you're going to have to settle for one from Europe, like the UK (though I've heard there are some US onlne stores that have their hands on these and selling them here). The display does not match the iPad's no matter how much better the Note is than the iPad. It's not a &#34;bad&#34; display by far, but the Retina Display is simply crisp and beautiful to look at. Also, I don't like the 10.1&#34; design (others may disagree). I feel that a shape like the iPad's is more practical for writing notes and doing things like playing games, but that might just be a very personal preference. (In case you don't know, the Note 10.1 is longer/larger than the iPad by a bit, but it is more rectangular in shape while the iPad comes closer to a square in shape, but not quite a square.)I don't know what else to say: if you have any questions, just ask and I'll be happy to reply.My final opinion: I think that this device convinced me that the tablet can be seriously used as a device for work as well as pleasure, and that accessory makers should start focusing on this product for making keyboards, cases, etc. I also feel that this tablet should convince developers to focus more on Android apps than on iOS apps simply because devices like this allow for so much more flexibility and because I see this as leading the way for more innovative Android products in the future.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

$REVIEW.: This is really easy to use speaker wire I used for a 5.1 system (Definitive Tech 60.6).  I like that they have the blue strip on one end so you don't confuse what goes where (red vs black).Lastly it was at an awesome price, I assume to compete with others including Amazon's 16 AWG.  I'd choose mediabridge again.  In fact, I did!  I ran out of the 100 feet and needed another 10 ft but for the price, i just bought another 100 feet in case.Easy to use, good quality, great price.  I even like that they have a service rep send out an email to reach out if I need anything and to review their product.  Smart.For what it is, it's the best!  Just know it's not true copper.  Does this make a difference unless you have a high-end ($500+) system?

$review_text.: I would say picture quality is fine: I have tried the various inputs and HD programming, etc, looks excellent
It's a thin and super-light unit which works well.It has hardly any inputs: 2 HDMI and one Composite


 One Coax input as well

 No additional Composite inputs or optical or the old RGB hookups

 I need several older devices to plug into this but just can't do it


 For the space available, it was the largest unit we could get at Best Buy, and for the price, I'm just not sold on it

 It looks good, but really needs way more inputs.The "switches" on the front of the unit (on/off, etc) are invisible, and aren't buttons at all but touch-switches

 I thought this was cool, but in dim light, you can't see where you need to press

$review_text.: I've had my C3030 for months, now.  It's so small I can take it everywhere--and I do. With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.  But I really don't need to.All in all, the C3030 is an excellent Camera.  The number of settings and menus is, at first, a bit daunting.  But spending some time to get to know the camera really unlocks its full potential.If you want an excellent digital camera, with excellent image quality, easy to use default settings, and advanced features for even more flexibility, the C3030 is the one to get.

$REVIEW.: The Martin Logan 10 speakers are fantastic - clear and powerful at any volume.My home theater setup is a 550w yamaha receiver, a JBL subwoofer, and two Martin Logan 10s to go with my projector/htpc source


I typically use this media room to watch movies or football/basketball, and these speakers are ideal for either use.I also listen to many genres of music, and couldn't be happier with the delicate, clear sound provided by the speakers

 My sister brought over a recording of her performance in the university's orchestra (Rachmaninov), and the whole family gathered around to listen
 We turned off the subwoofer to avoid muddling the sound, and we were rewarded with crisp, clean notes and a powerful bass
 My mom even commented that it sounded better on the speakers than the live performance did!  The bass is very good on these, but not powerful enough to use without a subwoofer in a real home theater environment

 For enjoying music, though, these would be perfect as a standalone pairThe speakers were well packaged, and very easy to setup

 It even comes with mountable spikes to improve stability on the carpet

 These replace the stock rubber feet intended for use on hard flooring.The banana plug connections are a great option, but I really liked the spring-loaded receptacle for accepting stripped and twisted speaker wire
 Much more usable than the twist lock system that my receiver uses.The speakers themselves just look cool, too

 The feet extend about an inch or two on all sides beyond the speakers (for stability), but that does mean that they will stand out from the wall a little


 It looks like they are floating in the room


 Just keep that in mind if you are looking for speakers that will fit in flush to your other equipment.

$review_text.: I bought this as a replacement for my aging Linksys wireless router that was working fine, however my range necessities increased when we moved into our new house. My old one worked fine, but I wanted better. This looked like a good prospect since it had dual-band capability. It wasn't the easiest to set up, however it was more difficult than previous experiences. The software was my first clue of what was to come. It failed to install on my reasonably new Gateway pc with Vista. Now I know Vista isn't the best, but it should've gone smoother than it did.I finally got it to install, and I managed to add my laptop, my remote pc, my printer, and my Wii to the network. It took about a week for each of these wireless components to start dropping intermittently from the network. I ended up reinstalling the software, and re-added the components, only to have them intermittently drop again. I wen through several iterations of the same experience.The range is no better than my old Linksys. The software has been horrid, and now it won't let me add any additional components, and the key has disappeared from the display. I'm ready to trade up already for something that actually works reliably. My old Linksys was so much more reliable.

If you're planning on attaching this to your waist it is the best price you'll find anyway.A good product perfect for a on-waist application.
$SUMMARY.: I use it as a microphone for my Stormtrooper armor

$review_text.: Another quality Timbuk2 product.The case is well designed, fits the latest Kindle like a glove, and provides great protection.The lining of the case is great; extremely soft, ensuring you don't scratch your Kindle

The memory foam case is a nice touch, it does a great job of absorbing and shock from a fall.I believe another review commented that the sound from the velcro was too loud...my ears must not be that sensitive


Yes, it sounds like you are opening velcro, but it is not that loud.Buy with confidence, this is a quality product.

$REVIEW.: I guess I'm not alone with the "frozen" player. It worked great for 2 months then stuck on start screen. I had already registered it on the sandisk website so I sent an e-mail to tech support.They replied the same day with some things to do to re-boot it. I tried and it didn't work so I e-mailed them back and within 6 hours they e-mailed me a pre-paid shipping label and a return authorization number. I shipped it off and received a brand new player within 6 days. They did not make me return it through Amazon and I put the player by itself into a padded envelope.Did not have receipt,original box or paperwork of any kind. Sandisk customer service is one of the best I have delt with and I work in purchasing and deal with hundredes of companies.If I have any problems with this one I will take the same steps again.I would also like to say that both of my children have the 1GB version of this sandisk and they have worked without a glitch for 6 months now, and my 11 year olds throw them in their backpacks, their desks, their pockets etc...they have really taken a beating and still work and sound great.

$REVIEW.: I bought this after reading several reviews of people that have had this for some time; now I understand why it seems to last for so long: it is really sturdy, and after a quick glance at the instructions it's very easy to use. I'm 6 feet tall and can easily get a Canon 30D at eye level.Everything seems easy to control with precision, which is a big reason why you'd get this over a cheaper model.You can leave a quick-release post on the camera, so it's a good idea to buy more of those if you have several cameras; you can also take the whole pan head out. You can even mount the camera on one of the posts - slick indeed!One thing I didn't get - Adorama didn't have it at the time - was a bag; do get one, it would be a shame to scrape this while transporting it.

$REVIEW.: The little plastic post things on the bottom of the stand (refer to picture of product) would be very annoying, but I use a keyboard attached to my 17" MacBook Pro when it's on the stand. I got the stand because I needed to sit farther from the screen when possible, not bend my neck so much and still read what is on it -- not easy with bifocals. The stand holds the Mac at a good height, and the little plastic posts flex enough to allow the top to close completely. I expected to configure a portable workstation and this works fine for that purpose. I don't know about the fan -- never use it.If someone plans to type on the MacBook keyboard, the posts are a real negative. But for me, and I'd expect for others with bifocals who do not enjoy the symphony of crackling vertebrae that follows a long notebook session, it's a great solution. The stand folds easily, fits into my notebook case with all the other junk in it, including the excellent Apple keyboard, and enables hours of work without the pain in the neck I had before. Yeah, this setup would look ridiculous at Starbucks, but I only go there on AARP nights.

$review_text.: I looked at quite a few tablets before deciding to buy the G-Tab and the selling point for me was the size and the price. When I opened the box and fired it up it was fully charged and best of all it didn't look like a cheap tablet. There is only one speaker so the tablet isn't very loud but I use headphones so it wasn't a big deal. It doesn't come preloaded with apps I'll never use so I was able to customize it the way I wanted to. Screen looksImpressive which means if you watch movies on your tablet you'll be blown away.The table this very easy to use and was able to navigate through the screens and options quickly and easily with zero difficulty.Granted there is limited memory but that's why it has expandable memory. You can pop in an SD card and boost it. I have no idea how the camera looks because I use my cell phone and have no need to use the camera on my tablet. The one issue everyone seems to have is the Wi-Fi but I had no issues there at all. Granted, this was just in house but at some point I'll take this out to test it further.I have only had the tablet for a day but so far I'm impressed. It may be priced low but for what it offeres it doesn't feel like a cheap tablet. For those who are looking for a tablet that fits into a budget go with the G-Tab and you won't be dissapointed. I have had no problems and recommend this to everyone.

If you want better pictures, you need to start with a cleaner lens.The brush is great, and the smudge remover really does work. I don't understand how it works, because if you touch the smudge remover to your skin, it leaves a black residue. I have no troubel with black smudges on my lens after using it.

$REVIEW.: The Sansa e260 4GB MP3 player lives up to all the features that I wanted: it is small, easy to use (intuitive), has all controls in an easy-to-access position, has a control-lock feature to prevent inadvertently modifying settings, has a bright screen, and - best of all - accepts micro flash cards so that I can retain my 'base' music catalogue and still provide, from time to time, other offerings as well

 The built-in microphone allows the Sansa to act as a voice recorder; I have not used this feature yet


 It is also possible, of course, to store animations, movies, and images on the Sansa.The sansa comes with re-charging and data-transfer cable, lanyard, and soft storage bag

 The lanyard is large enough that I can hang the Sansa around my neck
 The Sansa is heavy for its size - a feature that I like; the weight reminds me that I am carrying it and helps prevent loss.It is highly recommended to anyone who wants a great value at a good price.

$REVIEW.: As this product is my first of the type, I am very excited at my newfound convenience in being able to stream movies off my PC.  I have yet to try the 'services' - I will wait until I get it hard-wired as my bandwidth is only 2mb, but it streams (wireles) flawlessly from my PC with one exception - it will not play DVD folder structures (VOB) without freezing up.  Apparently, this defect goes back years - literally - and WD has yet to fix it.  That is absolutely pathetic.  The band-aid: take the VIDEO_TS folder and put it in an ISO, then it plays perfectly.  Yes, odd indeed but true.But, the little thing is so neat and capable otherwise, that I still rate it 4 stars.The only con aside from the above mentioned defect, is that the sound lacks volume and treble somewhat.  I currently have it wired via component out so hopefully the HDMI will improve this, but even through component, the sound should not be so much lower in volume and tone than all the other devices.

$review_text.: This KVM unit has two buttons on the front like most, one for computer 1 and one for computer 2
When I first connected this unit to my two computers, it worked flawlessly for half a day
I was in KVM heaven, no special setup was needed
At the end of the day, however, computer 2 stopped responding to the keyboard and mouse

As of now, the monitor switching still works, but I am back to two keyboards and two mice

Also, StarTech support today confirmed with me by telephone that switching the cables does not fix the problem with "computer 2" not responding to mouse and keyboard, meaning the problem is with their unit in port 2


Whichever computer is connected to port 1 works fine


I am returning this unit for a refund
The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it somewhat works, but it is close to the same as using no KVM.

Unlike a "sonic" cleaner, which uses vibrations only, we've trusted this ultrasonic on some of our more delicate items; a pair of antique eyeglasses (gently but thoroughly cleaned them), an antique magnifying glass with filigree and delicate handle (two cycles, one to clean the glass and filigree end, then turned the magnifier around to clean the handle with another cycle, leaving the lid open both times).There are 5 automatic settings - push the Set button for the pre-timed setting you desire, press On and let the cleaner to do its job - a function that's both helpful and practical.  Auto settings are displayed in seconds, but the minute times are 1 , 3, a little over 4 , a little over 6 minutes, and 8 minutes (we timed the settings, the cleaner ran accurately).I've been using hot water with a good squirt of dish liquid, mixed well before using.  Just pull out the plastic basket afterward and rinse everything under the tap (we do make sure the drain is closed).  Always check with your jeweler or one of many online sites to see what stones/metals may be safely cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner.Pros:1) Very powerful cleaning ability yet quiet operation2) Able to safely clean antique items (use the shortest cycle and check for any loose areas prior to cleaning), unlike `sonic only' cleaners which may damage items3) 5 useful Auto Timed settings4) Cleans glasses and even larger items when the lid is left open5) Operating buttons located on the unit, not the lid - durable design6) 6 month warrantyCons:1) Does not heat water, which would be usefulThe New Trent CD-3800 is a well designed powerful ultrasonic cleaner with the extra feature of pre-timed settings - I'm impressed with this ultrasonic cleaner.

$REVIEW.: I returned this mouse unopened shortly after receiving it because the mouse is so big.  It has been perhaps 20 years since I have seen a mouse this large.  Instead I bought the smaller Logitech M325 model, which I am extremely pleased with.I wear large gloves, so I suspect this mouse is either suited to people with much longer fingers, wider hands, and who would wear extra large gloves.  Because the mouse needs to move around, this is definitely unsuitable unless you have a large area for the mouse to move in as far as I am concerned.
$review_summary.: This is a large mouse and it is only suitable for those individuals with hands much wider and fingers longer than most.

$REVIEW.: I picked up this PSU for a budget build I did for a friend of mine. The computer wasn't built to be a powerhouse by any means but I wanted to be sure I got a reputable power supply with plenty of wattage. It's a nice, heavy unit (some power supplies can be super lightweight and feel incredibly cheap) and  has plenty of cooling. It looks great in the stealthy black finish. It has ample power connectors and each cable lead is braided in a black mesh to keep things organized. For the price it's an excellent PSU that I wouldn't hesitate to put in any mid-to-low power machine.

$REVIEW.: This picture is so clear that when I watch a football game, I can count the blades of grass!  I've had other hd tv's but this is by far the best clarity
 I only wish I was able to get the 46" tv, but I could only fit the 40 in the armoire

 The sound isn't the greatest, but who doesn't hook up their tv to a home theater system?? The 3D feature is really cool

 It doesn't so much jump out at you when you watch, rather inside, the set gains depth
 I watched a half of basketball on christmas and it made it exciting

 Do yourself a favor and get the package with the glasses and blu ray dvd player


 The 2d to 3d feature isn't quite as good as the regular 3d versions

It's ok but nothing to write home about
The regular picture is so real that, frankly, everything looks almost 3D!  The comcast guy who was setting up the tv's when we moved in must've stared at the screen for a half hour

I really thought we would have needed to kick him out!

$REVIEW.: this headset plugs right into the xbox controller, had a volume control for the headphone, that goes down to no volume or mute, and a mute switch for the microphone.initially the bar that goes over your head was very curved and therefore very tight, but it's loosened up a lot after a few weeks of use. If it really bothered me I would have tried dipping it in boiling water to heat up and lossen the plastic and try to gently bend it to accommodate a larger head.the only thing i don't like about this headset is the microphone only swivels down in one direction, so the earpiece is always on your left ear. I would prefer it could be switched around.

$REVIEW.: Well, you know what they say. Hind sight is 20/20. Lesson learned. This camera is wonderful and I am an idiot. I have now used the Nikon P100 (returned 2 due to lockup and then some more serious issues), this one, the Fuji HS10 and now I own the Panasonic FZ35. The sony has the BEST picture quality simply set to auto. The next would be the Nikon and Pany tied for 2cd with the Pany taking much better quality photos, and the 3rd would be the HS10 which in my HUMBLE opinion STANK in auto.I returned the Sony to Wolf camera basically because I wanted to try the new HS10 ,which hadn't been released yet, and the fact that I owned so many nice FAST SDHC class 6 and 10 memory cards. And then I end up returning the Fuji. After the Sony I realized how bad the pics taken with the Fuji really were. But it was too late. So I just got the Panasonic. I do like it, but I am still learning the camera. I only recieved it yesterday.The Sony takes beautiful macro shots with SUCH ease, not so for me with the other cameras. It took lovely night shots, good indoor shots and all in an auto settings mode. I wish I could say I played with other settings but I really didn't. The in camera Panning mode works really well, again, MUCH better picture than with the HS10 in the same mode.Colors were lovely and pics were SHARP. I loved that. I would get some over processing, but I now realize all I had to do was go in and change the settings, tweek it a little. Live and learn.So I simply want to recommend this camera. I have compared it to many others, but no Canons. so I'm of no help there. I feel almost anyone can take great pictures right out of the box with this baby.I'm still kicking myself.

$review_text.: For my review I compared between the Jabra Solemate and the Transit and the differences are:1) The Solemate has much better low range than does the Transit. The Jabra has got three speakers, two tweeters and a sub woofer versus only two in the Transit.2) The Solemate can be connected wired or wirelessly via Bluetooth, USB cable or 3.5 mm audio cable located in the Solemate, while the transit can only be connected either Bluetooth or wired.3) Also the Solemate can be charged either USB while connected to the USB port on the PC, versus the Transit requiring a separate charge cable and the use of the 3.5 mm audio cable, which means that the Jabra Solemate actually while connected to a PC plays digitally versus analog.4) Another difference is that the Solemate comes with a protective bag to protect it while outdoors.  Protects it from the elements (sand at the beach etc.)  It also sounds the same with the bag covering it.For the money right now Amazon is selling the JABRA Solemate for $141.21 with Free Shipping and the Transit is $249.95 with Free shipping.Also the Solemate is physically smaller.In my opinion this is simply not a good value for the money.

$REVIEW.: I have been looking for something I could use with my phone for quite some time


I didn't want something that stuck to the window because of field of view issues


I didn't want something that attached to the dash because I thought it would be too awkward with my dash
When I saw this, I thought it would be good to try since I rarely (if ever) use my CD player these days anyway

After testing it for a little over a month, I'm mostly pleased but have a few issues.In the &#34;pro&#34; department, this thing couldn't be easier to install or to use
I'm honestly not even sure if it came with instructions, as I simply didn't need them
It goes in and tightens with a quick turn of the screw towards the bottom

It is pretty secure, though I wouldn't go around pulling on it
The grip on my phone is also secure - no slippage or any other issues
It adjusts up or down easily and pretty much stays where it is put.However - there are a few caveats (not really &#34;cons&#34;, since I have a sneaking suspicion that these are probably vehicle-centric)


When I have this in my CD player, and have my phone in it, it tends to block a few important things - mainly my climate control


I have to reach behind in order to adjust the temperature, and around/behind to turn on the windshield defrost
It also blocks the power/volume button for the stereo.For me, these are annoying but fairly minor

And as I said, probably vehicle specific


Not a deal-breaker at the moment, though I will probably continue to look for something that fits my car a bit better.

$REVIEW.: This product does work as it is intended, but it didn't fix all my computer problems. It did remove the trojans and viruses that had infected my computer. I could only use this in SafeMode. It wouldn't work at all in Normal mode. But it wasn't able to remove the backdoor files that the trojans and virsus had left, preventing me from having full use of my computer. I contacted the Tech Support and was able to get his assistance via remote connect. But I didn't like the fact that he never actually called me and told me what he was doing. He instaled a program on my compuer, that was suppost to give me back control over my control panel (trojans took that over) - but it didn't work. The time that I wasted using this program, communicating with tech support, and waiting on everything via remote connect - I could have already reinstalled my entire operating system. Which I had to reinstall the operating system on all 3 of my computers anyways. If you have a major infection, don't waste your money on any software or service to &#34;fix&#34; it. Just get all important files off your computer by loading them to USB flash drive and reinstall your entire operating system. That way you will know for certain that the infections are truly gone and any backdoor files have been completely erased. By reloading your entire operating system, it will delete any and all files that are currently on your computer - basically restoring your computer to an out of the box state. That is the best and safest way to remove any infection. The one set back to that would be reinstalling any OS updates, which can be time consuming - but the cheapest way. I personally can not recommend this product because it didn't fix any of the issues that remained on my computer.

The good thing is that they come with Microsoft Office which should come in handy when they go back to school later this year. They are fast and the touch screen works.

 The Incipio Inscribe Capacitive Tip stylus does the job quite well

 It eliminates the touches with my finger that are in the wrong place and when coupled with a good case, is handy and useful
I'm so glad I bought this stylus.

$review_text.: The Logitech Wireless USB Speaker Z515 is about the size of a tall paperback book, and it packs a lot of power for its small size. I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the sound quality is for a unit this small. I would compare the sound quality to that of a good quality nightstand radio (or radio/CD player/alarm clock, etc.). My desktop and laptop (the former running Windows 7 64-bit, the latter Vista) recognized the USB dongle right away, so for me set up was literally plug & play. I did have to discover on my own (this wasn't in the literature) that turning the speaker off (there's a button on the upper rear of the unit) turns Windows Media Player off, and in order to switch from using the Z515 to wired speakers I have to remove the USB dongle (and can do so by simply removing it, i.e., no need to go through a "safely remove this hardware" step). (If I want to mute the unit without turning Windows Media Player off, I have to remember to simply turn it down instead of off.)One bit of information you won't find in the literature or at the Logitech website concerns the life of and potential to replace the built-in rechargeable battery. I emailed Logitech and received a response within less than 24 hours, and am told that Logitech will replace the unit "free of charge" should the battery fail within the 2 year warranty period, and that the battery is otherwise NOT "user" replaceable. Whether this means that it can be replaced by a handy user who is into opening gadgets up remains to be seen, but I do want to mention that the presence of recessed screws on the rear of the unit lead me to think that it may at least be possible to open the unit up (after the warranty period has passed, of course) and maybe replace the battery. In any case, the speaker can also be AC powered via the included adapter.I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker to a laptop using student living in a dorm or anyone whose living quarters are small or who travels with a laptop - or simply an MP3 player (which requires a wired connection) - and wants to have with them a handy portable travel speaker. The Z515 comes with a handsome zippered carrying case with a fairly rugged exterior (the carrying case holds the speaker but not the AC adapter; the USB dongle fits into a compartment under the fold-out speaker stand) to protect it during transport. Would make a great gift for a college student who doesn't have room for wired computer speakers.The wireless range has been great for me. I can go anywhere in any room of my 1700 square foot home and stay connected, and I can go on the porch, in the garage, or close to the house in the driveway without getting disconnected.Would make a great gift for anyone who can use a compact wireless speaker. Although the sound is stereo - there are two speakers side-by-side in the unit - because of the size of the unit and short distance of the speakers from each other, the sound of the Z515 is akin to that of a good quality mono table radio. I personally don't get much sense of stereo separation when listening to it, but I don't count this as a drawback or con given the size, convenience, portability, and overall sonic quality of the unit.

There was one available for free.

$REVIEW.: Reading some of the other reviews I felt the need to balance out some of the negative comments.First, some feel that the hard drive space is too small, and that streaming will be an issue
Well, I've watched three movies and about a dozen TV shows on it so far, and I can tell you that streaming is not an issue

Perhaps other devices have problems but the aTV has never even hiccuped once

Streaming video takes about 5-10 seconds to buffer up, about enough time to put down the remote, sit back, and pick up the popcorn.And since streaming is not an issue, neither is the hard drive space


I keep all of the movies and shows I've downloaded from iTMS safely on the 500GB RAID drive attached to my iMac


I did sync all of my music to the aTV, but even that only used a quarter of the space


Unless you a torrent fiend you'll have plenty of room.As to video quality I rate it between cable and DVD, based on watching it using a 42" Samsung Plasma TV.Others have suggested getting an iPod and the A/V dock, but then you're missing out on the "Front Row" interfac

And remember, the aTV is essentially a mini-Mac-mini that runs OS X


Because of this I envision plenty of upgrades and goodies to come.The only real drawback I've found thus far is that, unlike an iPod, it won't play audiobooks purchased from Audible (and I have a LOT of them), but it will play audiobooks purchased from iTMS (go figure)


All in all, it's a great first entry in a very promising product line.

$REVIEW.: Now that Pentax has come out with the K-3, the real retail price of K-5ii has gone down by $500 -- so that a great value becomes an insanely great value.  With the 18-135mm lens, for $950 you get a camera that is comparable to a Nikon D7100 with 18-140 lens, which currently (4/20/2014) sells for $1500.  Both have solid magnesium bodies -- not plastic over a metal frame, DX sensors, and comparably excellent image quality.  The Pentax is fully weatherproof -- you can shoot in a heavy rainstorm without worry -- while Nikon is vague about the extent of its weatherproofing.  Image quality of the K-5ii is as good as the K-3 -- in fact, the K-5ii gets a higher score from Dxomark.  The K-3 has better video features than the K-5ii, but no Pentax or Nikon camera gives really good control over video -- you're much better off with an inexpensive camcorder.  (If for some reason you have to use a DSLR for video, get a Canon -- but at this price range, you'll be stuck with the cheap plastic construction and lack of weather-sealing of the Ti line.)

$REVIEW.: This flexible tripod is serviceable, if you have a very small, very lightweight little camera.  It's not the greatest flexible tripod I've ever used- I prefer the GorillaPod, which feels more well-made than the AmazonBasics offering.  However, I wanted a flexible tripod I could keep in my plane and wrap around different things in the cockpit and put my flip-cam on, to record little segments of flights.  This works fine for that, for now.  I don't have high hopes for the durability of this item, but for now, it works for light duty, holding up a light camera.  But I think you'd be fine, skipping this one and getting a real GorillaPod, if you're looking for a flexible tripod.

$review_text.: This replaced a tube TV in a dining room

 The old TV had still been working well so I had something to quickly compare the new TV to and, for a few weeks, I was not able to be fully satisfied with the new image

 It is incredibly sharp and shows very fine details (when broadcast)
 Colors are gorgeous and very vivid


 Sometimes overly so and I adjusted the color down slightly for something closer to the colors I am accustomed to


 Still, the image seemed less bright than my old TV
 I have another Sony tube TV in my home, a 32inch, and kept going between the two TV's comparing the image
 The tube TV is less sharp and the colors less vivid, but I liked the overall picture better
 I finally went to a store with many TV's (all large screens) and began looking carefully at the images and discovered that the LCD sets all lacked the brightness of the LED sets
 Perhaps it is just the state of the technology


 After several weeks I have grown accustomed to this new TV and like it very much

 I would not go back to my old tube set now because I enjoy the new sharpness and vivid colors

 Future flat screens I buy will definitely be LED but I don't believe Sony offers a 22 inch LED model, and I wanted the smaller screen for this room


 Sony has never failed me for over 40 years and I love their products and expect this new product will serve me equally well
 The sound is excellent as well, but I do not expect more than good-quality sound


 If I needed any better I would connect to an external audio system of some sort
 Very happy with my purchase
 I would recommend this TV to anyone.November 18, 2011:  I just returned home from a 6 week trip staying in an apartment equipped with a 50" Panasonic Viera plasma TV and now understand my discontent with this 22" Bravia
 I had never seen a plasma display before and was truly mesmerized by it's beautiful, extremely natural image and color

 While my LCD display is great, I will never be as satisfied as I was with the plasma image, but, I can actually enjoy my LCD set better now that I understand why my old tube set kept looking better
 It wasn't just my imagination but was a significant difference in technologies
 But the plasma set was extremely heavy.March 23, 2013:  Set has begun freezing and cannot be controlled until unplugged and allowed to reset


 Then it works again...until the next time it freezes again
 Contacted a trusted repair technician and described the problem and he knew immediately what was wrong and identified the component needed


 However, after searching further, he could not locate any of the needed components and told me he could not repair it

 He further asked if it was made in China because the situation was indicative of a product made there
 When I checked the TV label, sure enough, there it was---"Made in China"
 More cheap junk and certainly a blemish on the good reputation of Sony
 So I have, with sadness, bought my last Sony product

 When they were from Japan they could be depended on to be top-of-the-line but since they have chosen to put their name on Chinese garbage they have gotten their last dollar from me

 What a sad end to a brand synonymous with quality for so long.



$SUMMARY.: Very Happy With My Purchase (Not any more!)

$review_text.: I've used Trackman trackballs since the late 90's - still have the second one I ever bought, a Trackman Marble, in use on my work desktop. I took them up due to RSI pain I developed playing first person shooters at that time. The thumbball didn't require all the forearm movement necessary for mouse-use, isolating 99% of the movement to the thumb. Thumball's aren't for everyone, but I found the level of control to be fine enough for use with everything from Photoshop to gameplay (both fine-pixel movement apps). Since that time I've moved on from the game-play, but the trackmen still sit right next to every keyboard I own. I've been using the current incarnation, the "Wheel Optical" variant with my laptops for several years. They're functionally equivelent to the older marbles, and I've had no issues using them for the same range of material. I hear that the newer "laser" mice have better fine-control than the older opticals, and would definitately upgrade, if logitech brings one to market in the same form-factor, but until then I'll keep buying the old-faithful.

$review_text.: I figured for the cost and the positive reviews I couldn't go wrong.Unfortunately, I tried one of those leaf-style antennas first (like a mouse pad with a coax cable coming out of it)


Compared to the leaf-style, this little antenna is marginal

I live roughly 30 miles from the transmission towers but I have true line-of-sight

The leaf antenna found 30 local channels and I was able to view all of them clearly.I installed this antenna and most of the channels the leaf antenna picked up clearly now display "No Signal"

Some channels come through fine, others are so fragmented and choppy they are unwatchable.This antenna might be acceptable for those who live closer to the broadcast towers, and is more portable, if that is more important than reception quality.Spend the extra money on a leaf-style antenna (BUT AVOID THOSE INFOMERCIALS!!! You can find them a lot cheaper on the internet!)

$review_text.: Let me get the biggest con out of the way. The mouse has weight. Its huge, its bulky. Some people may like it, but I don't. My previous mouse wasMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000and I felt that that mouse hit the sweet spot in terms of the weight strain I wanted to put on my hands.Back on topic, excluding that one con, the G700 is full of win. As with my previous mouse, the "Plug-in Nano Receiver" doesn't stick out of the USB port reducing the risk of accidentally clipping it. The scrolling wheel has two settings which can be changed at the press of a button, freespin and "notched" spin mode. The freespin mode allows you to scroll down a page without the worry of friction on the wheel (much beneficial in gaming mode). The "notched" mode adds some friction to the wheel and would better be suited when browsing through long pages.Moving on to the one thing Logitech advertises about the mouse the most, buttons. Yes, there are indeed a lot of buttons. Downside is that you will barely use them unless you play a lot of MMORPGS (which unfortunately, I don't). Anyways, I popped in a game of Crysis to observe the results and compare it with my older mouse. I can barely explain them in technical terms, but the response times were amazing, a lot better than my previous mouse. No missed hits, no blaming on the lag. The mouse is set at 500 reports/second right out of the box, but can go as high as 1000.Being a gaming mouse, this thing is designed for comfort, which I believe degrades the overall look. The battery is rechargeable and it comes with a cable to do so. The cable port is same as a HTC HD2's, so if you happen to lose it, you know what to look for. There is a button designed to change the speed of the mouse without having to go to the Control Panel every time. The box was enclosed in a frustration-free packaging, which is a big plus too.Overall, I would really recommend this mouse, but you will have to do some getting used to if your previous mouse is as small as mine.

$REVIEW.: I replaced all the office Pentium/CRT units with Atoms/LCD displays and saw our power consumption cut by 50%. But a recent client required us to work with several Excel sheets with a total or 300,000 rows and the Atom started to bog down and VLOOKUPs started freezing on me.I stumbled upon this great board in Amazon and promptly setup a test unit with a Core i3-520 and 4Gb RAM - the speed at which those Excel files loaded/worked blew me away.I'm using the on-board DVI output coupled with a low-profile Radeon 4350 video card for a dual-monitor setup. For applications that requires raw processing power, productivity is definitely way better than the Atoms without sacrificing power efficiency.The Core i3, on-chip HD graphics capability, HDMI port, and power-efficient design makes this a much better choice as a HTPC than the Atoms as it doesn't choke on 1080p or Blu-ray movies.A great compromise between power consumption, processing power, and price!

All the mics, while stretching wildly (price-wise), seemed to have some flaws and appears your camera can be responsible for some issues as well


I'm no expert and this is my first attempt at sound recording with any device other than internal mics.I decided to get some experience by getting a relatively cheap, but well reviewed model

Of those available, this wasn't the cheapest (close), but seems to have the potential I was looking for
I also got the mono/stereo adapter plugCables To Go 40634 3.5mm Stereo Male to 3.5mm Mono Female Adapter (Metallic Silver).This mic really does work & work well
My set up with either the T3i or 60D allows manual sound adjustment & this mic works very nicely on both cameras

Yes ther are some issues such as noise, but it really is a nice mic overall.This also allows you to better  target the sound


Since many others complained about poor results with the normal setting, I've only used it on tele

I'm still unsure about using the Magic Lantern firmware upgrade, but that could conceivably resolve some issues.Yes, it would be nice if it had an on/off LED


Yes, it would be nice if a stereo adapter wasn't needed


The fact remains this is a very well made mic available at a very reasonable price from a highly respected mfr
that includes a lifetime guarantee
I recommend this product, it's definitely a good value.

$review_text.: Once I tried my first pair of Bluetooth headphones for running, I never went back to wired

 Not having a cord running between the headphones and my player and bounding around was worth the higher cost of the headphones and needing to charge the headphones periodically.I found the Denon Exercise Freak to be lightweight and comfortable to wear

 The earbud turns and is articulated so that you can position it comfortably in your ear
 The ear tip that extends into your ear canal is not a tight fit


 I prefer a loose fit so that I can hear the ambient noise when I am running on the road so that I know when a car is approaching from behind

 The wire that runs between the earpieces has a reflective band on it which is a nice touch.The sound quality is good but not great
 I haven't experienced may dropouts while running while I am holding my player in my hand.Overall, I have been pleased with the Denon Exercise Freak.


$SUMMARY.: Good wireless headphones for running

$review_text.: I upgraded to the View from a Sansa e260. I liked the e260, but I had several issues with it: (1) Synch was clumsy and didn't always work. (2) the MicroSD slot wasn't very useful, since it forced me to synch in MSC mode. (3) Video playback was unwatchable, primarily due to the poor synch between audio and video on the device.The Sansa View addresses all of these issues pretty well. With 16 GB, I fon't need the MicroSD slot--the View synched all of my music, every video I had on my PC, and every photo I had on the PC, with 2 GB to spare. Wow!Synch is much cleaner. Synch uses Microsoft Sync Center and syncs to Windows Media Player without a hitch. And video is not bad. The player can play WMV and MP4 files natively, without having to fool with Sansa's Media Center application. There is a bit of artifacting in movies (jaggies when a fast move occurs), but movies are still watchable.I got this unit for planes and trains. I can throw it in my pocket without worrying about spare batteries or any of the other hassles I had with my larger screen video player. I think it's going to work well for that purpose.

$review_text.: First let's get this out of the way: you need to understand SquareTrade's warranties to appreciate them, and make appropriate decisions on them.  If you understand that the value of the warranty diminishes with your repair claims, then you're OK. The point of the ST warranty is to make sure your computer runs for the duration of the warranty period OR fix or replace it up to, or until, the face value of the warranty is met. Meaning: if you have warranted the computer for $1000, and it is repaired at a repair cost of $200, your remaining warranty is only good for $800 worth of additinoal repairs or refund during the warranty period. I understand this and think it is a fair policy which helps keep pricing affordable.My claims experience with SquareTrade is twofold. About a year into the warranty my touchscreen laptop had a screen problem. SquareTrade repaired it quickly. Unfortunately the screen still occassionally lost its touch ability, but this seemed more software based than hardware as a reboot would correct. All in all I was happy with the repair. The cost of the repair was valued at roughly $250, which seemed reasonable.About a year after that, in a rush, I unfortunately dropped the laptop and broke it severely. I felt terrible as this is my daughter's computer which she loves. Since we had Accidental Damage protection (thought we might need it for my daughter and not for me!) I frantically called SquareTrade. My call was taken care of quickly and professionally. I sent the laptop in and in 2 days was greeted with a warranty payment equal to the face amount minus the $250 previous repair charge. This allowed me to replace my daughter's computer quickly (and with less of a wallet impact) and not have an issue with her school work.Worked exactly as advertised by SquareTrade and I am very happy with their service. This experience will provide additional peace of mind to me should I ever need to make another claim (which I hope I do not) on any of the other items I have warranted with them.

$review_text.: ...although I should thank Amazon Warehouse for first sending me a busted-up 50" version of last year's C8000 or I may never have experienced the awesomeness of the 59" D8000!The great (and exhaustive) information at AVSFourm lead me to this beauty, which I purchased from BuyDig due to Amazon Warehouse hanging me up on a C8000 replacement, and then Amazon taking forever to get the new 2011 Samsungs into inventory and listed for sale. I've got mine paired up with aSamsung BD-D6700 3D Blu-ray PlayerusingAmazonBasics High Speed HDMI Cable. I wall mounted the set with aSanus Vlt14-B1 Super-Slim Tilt Mountbracket. I'm usingSamsung's SSG-3100GB 3D Glassesthat came as part of theShrek/Megamind 3D Starter Kit, which was included as a promotional item with this set.Regarding picture quality:- Simply outstanding. Crisp definition. True colors that aren't overly bright or artificial. Inky black blacks.- No ghosting or shadows. Great with fast action and camera panning. Haven't tried video games.- No sign of jutter or film effect; the high refresh rate makes any motion smooth and realistic, especially noticeable in-store when comparing this side-by-side with a lower refresh TV.- Not so hot as a PC monitor with respect to reading tiny text.If you're worried about the size possibly being too big:- I thought I was pushing my luck after my wife commented that the broken 50" C8000 that showed up at our front door (but was never mounted) looked "too big." And I'll admit, this 59" TV is huge, but once we sat back to enjoy it, I don't know how we suffered (*cough, cough*) with out 32" Trinitron tube for the past 14 years.- With whatever up-convert happens between our DVD player and the TV itself, standard definition movies still look fine on this set. No, they're not as amazingly crystal clear as high-def Blu-ray content, but they're not at all blocky as I had expected.- You will want to take advantage of any HD cable, satellite or over-the-air broadcasts you might have available. Standard definition television picture quality will make you crazy after knowing the cleanliness of HD. (In our case, we're sticking with Comcast's most basic service but added their converter box, and are paying them about $28 per month.)- The VESA mounting pattern on the back is 800mm x 600mm, the largest size the Sanus mount I linked to supports. It's probably worth checking that whatever mount you select is compatible with this pattern.3D movies on this set are simply outstanding. So far, I've only got the Shrek discs that came with Samsung's starter kit to view, though I've got a couple more on the way. The big screen gives a really perceptible depth effect when viewed from my normal sitting position approximately 10 feet away. But we have a wide room and even from viewing angles of 45 the effect is still present with only very minor drop-offs in color and brightness (the picture noticeably dims once the 3D glasses are powered on, especially when the room is bright).3D setup and playback is a cinch -- the sync signal is bluetooth, so each pair of glasses needs to be paired the first time used. Pairing involves nothing more than turning the glasses on, and since the bluetooth signal is bi-directional, the television recognizes when the glasses are activated and provides a brief pop-up indication in the lower left corner saying so.After that initial setup, inserting a 3D disk and pressing play is all that's required to get the show going. The TV even automatically powers on and switches to the correct input when I power up my Samsung player and insert a disk.During the day I've watched my movies with the bright overhead lights on, and daylight lighting the room through two large windows. The anti-reflective coating on the screen is excellent! There's no apparent glare, and the brightness of the screen even at the factory setting (if I recall correctly, it's initially set at brightness level 48) is more than enough overcome this ambient light, without washing out the deep, dark black levels. (The 3D glasses reflect lighted surfaces located directly behind my head; in this case a darker room is preferred lest I need to fashion side-shades for the glasses.) In a dark room, the picture is simply jaw-dropping.Even the built-in speakers of this set do an adequate job of getting the sound out. Fine in a pinch, but I think you'll agree it's no match for amping the audio through an AV receiver to external speakers (in our case, aDenon AVR-3311CIwhich supports HDMI 1.4a and 3D pass-through.)Samsung's QWERTY remote is really a huge leap forward from a standard numeric remote, but is slow and slightly awkward in use. The two-sided remote resembles a conventional numbers-only device on one side, beaming our traditional infrared signals. The keyboard side takes advantage of the D8000's bluetooth, and is therefore only compatible with the television, and not the Samsung DVD player, nor any other device.  The keyboard side of the remote even has a usable thumb sensor -- sort of like a track pad on a Blackberry or a thumb control on a laptop keyboard -- allowing easy cursor navigation of the built-in web browser and applications.However, try as they might, the remote + SmartTV web apps still leave a bit to be desired when compared to a PC interface. For instance, sites like Hulu and NBC won't play Flash video (which I was aware of prior to purchase). So instead, I connect my laptop viaSiig's USB to HDmi adapterto watch broadcast TV shows, and will switch to a PC with a HDMI-out video card sometime in the future.The television's Netflix capabilities are solid. My one gripe is that once I locate and begin watching a movie, but then pause it and return to finish it on a different day, it has taken me quite a bit of searching to re-find it. But once I do, it resumes where I left off, and all of the expected pause, fast forward and rewind functions work as expected. However, once inside the Netflix app, I'm locked out of accessing the television's menu, so I lose the ability to adjust picture (and audio, if using the TV speakers).There are a number of redundant SmartTV features between the television and my Samsung DVD player, and if it were truly "smart," might it not somehow combine these Samsung web apps so that I'm only dealing with one Netflix, one YouTube, one browser, etc.? Because it sure would be nice to use the QWERTY remote on everything, including Pandora, which (I believe) isn't available as an application on the television. As it is, each application has its own login process, with the Netflix process being quite different from Pandora or YouTube, for instance.The YouTube app needs improvement. It doesn't make use of the remote's QWERTY keypad, and instead requires the user to use the cursor buttons to scroll around the on-screen virtual keyboard to conduct a video search. Instead, I use the TV's built-in web browser to access YouTube, which works pretty well, even in full-screen mode.The most desirable part of the Facebook app would be the photo viewer, which for some inexplicable reason won't take advantage of the full screen size -- even for photos that were uploaded at full resolution. This makes showing off baby and vacation pictures a bit of a yawner. The photos tend to be small and a little washed out, though easy to navigate between albums. The rest of the Facebook application is cumbersome to navigate, read and update, and never seems to fully load.One last comment, regarding some criticism I've read regarding the television's silver bezel: it really isn't a stand-out issue. In a dark room, you'll never see it. In a lighted room, it doesn't pop out to me like it does in the product shots shown here and on other sites. It really is a flat finish that doesn't reflect back a whole lot of light, it blends nicely with the glass overlay, and isn't something I'm ever conscious of.Samsung has put together a really nice television here at an attractive price, packed with lots of features and a stunning picture. I simply can't imagine anything to complain about and enthusiastically recommend anyone looking to check one of these out at a local electronics store to be wowed by its brilliance.

$REVIEW.: I just received this adapter and installed it almost without any problems.  The instructions in the booklet for inserting the card were different from the software--one said to turn off your computer.  I tried it without turning it off and it worked (sort of).  After completing the installation I still didn't have an interent or networking connection and the signal strenght was poor.  (We have a Linksys wireless router--about five feet away).After going through the help screen in the utility menu about four times--it was no help.  I finally figured out that it needed the ssid--it didn't detect it automatically (like the usb version does).  To make a long story short--I finally manually inputted the ssid and after tinkering a little more it worked.

$review_text.: There is a huge bug in Windows 7 (Home) that I ran into when I bought a second WD Elements USB drive to act as a backup to my first WD Elements USB drive, both models the same size (2TB). I found that when I plugged in the new second drive, it was not recognized by the system, no disk letter was assigned, it didn't show up in Explorer. I got the normal USB sound plugging it in, and in fact in Device Manager both drives were there, and clicking on them I was told both were working OK.I know the new 2TB drive I received was not damaged, because if I plugged it in alone, i.e. with my existing 2TB WD drive removed, it worked fine. Plug in the two drives in any order and only one or the other will show up in Explorer! The other stays hidden with no drive letter assigned and inaccessible.Good news is that after about four hours work researching this and trying things, I got both drives working. I will explain below how I did it.First I want to curse out Microsoft (and WD too). This is a horrible bug, USB drives are supposed to be plug and play. I'm an engineer, so was able to plow though some technical forum postings, but most non-techies would be stumped by this. Buying a second drive to act as a backup has got to be fairly common, this is not an unusual configuration. The cursing applies to WD too, because this problem is known to them, in fact I found the hint on one of their forums for the solution. I read that WD metaphorically shrugs and blames Microsoft, but by providing no insert in the disk drive packaging to warn and/or provide a work around, they are just leaving their customers hanging.I started my research by searching the Amazon reviews and found some tips and tricks that had worked for others to get a single WD drive recognized, but none of them worked in this case. Here is what I tried: reversed the order of plugging in USB cable and drive power, added some media, i.e. put the new empty drive on another computer and copied over a file to it, renamed the new drive so drives had different names, enabled/disabled the drives in Device Manager, and rebooted a bunch of times. All to no avail.Here's what did work. I had read on a WD forum that one user with the same problem had gotten his drives working by plugging both drives into a Window7 Pro. His explanation had something to do with the computer needing to reassign signatures when two drives are the same, and he guessed that Windows Home for some reason (bug!!) is unable to do this, but his other machine could. At that point he was able to move the drives back to Windows Home, and they now were both recognized, the signatures apparently fixed (permanently) by the other machine.I have an old Windows XP machine, so I used that. I just plugged both 2TB WD drives into the XP and let them sit for a minute or two until their drive lights stopped flashing, and sure enough when I moved them back to my Window7 Home machine, both drives now displayed in Explorer and both could be accessed. I later was able to fully copy the contents of the first drive to the second.Microsoft's incompetence is dragging down the USA's technical reputation. Not only does Windows7 file search not work right, Windows7 System Restore is so buggy that it is not reliable, but now I find that its plug and play can't handle two identical drives!

Seems sturdy and feels good.Easy to hold for both browsing and watching movies.However...1) Its heaver than you'd expect. After the lengths to which Apple goes to shave every 0.1 ounce, would prefer a case thats equally careful with not adding on extra weight.2) The holes for the Home and Volume buttons do not line up.Constantly hitting leather with that home button is not a pleasant experience, given how often its used.It comes in a nice pouch which I dont understand - who cares about a  pouch for a case?  wish they''d rather addressed real usage issues.That to me is a little sloppy and why Im giving 4stars.

$REVIEW.: This is a nicely laid out case with a good cable routing system and easy drive install and removal. As supplied, there is a lot of cooling and room to work on and install components and aesthetically it is a notch above most. The mechanical parts are sturdy, quiet with three fans running and modular in construction.Instructions for inexperienced assemblers are not good, particularly when making panel and other electrical connections to a mother board. As an example, there is a fan control switch with a power connection and four fan connections. No instructions. The four fan connections are only required if fans are added to the case as the existing fans are already wired. There are no instructions regarding wiring power, reset, etc. and mother boards only provide pin identification, but not connector orientation.

$review_text.: The Gripster makes it easy to watch movies, work a crossword, or perform any other task where using both hands on a mostly vertical screen makes sense. On its own, the Fire is hard to prop up on a slick surface. As promised, though, the Gripster does grip exceedingly well.That said, I really want a case to protect my Fire. The Gripster does that very well. The Fire easily slips into the case where a single flap holds it very securely in place. The Fire stays put in this case. This Gripster + a screen protector should keep my Fire looking new long after it's obsolete.If I have a knock, it's the busy look of the design. I'm not sure the two fabrics go together. However, I'm used to it now and quite happy with my Gripster.

The sound quality is surprisingly decent considering the nature of the device. There is some noticable hiss during quiet music. The remote seems to be a waste; it works, but so what. Maybe if somebody in the back seat wants to use it. Actually, the kids don't; they want to plug their mp3 players into it instead.

The images and video performance of this monitor are just great. Other then the fact that I have a widescreen and more real estate, I forget I am viewing another monitor. The picture is quite comparable to the CRT. I popped in my Superbit Spiderman DVD to check out the performance and it looked very good, at least I was pleased. I found the default resolution of 1680x1050 a bit too high for text viewing so I settled on 1280x1024. There are quite a number of supported resolutions.I debated on whether on not to go to widescreen for my computer, and now I'm glad I did. Most programs take advantage of the widescreen. Excel charts span the entire width and many Web sites will also stretch to fill the entire width so you don't have to scroll so much to read the text. Outlook fills the entire screen as well letting you see more of those verbose e-mails. You can open a window to what would be full screen on a standard aspect ratio monitor, and then open other windows and cascade them side by side. Vertically splitting windows allows you to see more of each window. I don't think I'd go back to the 3X4 aspect ratio.
$review_summary.: Very good monitor

$review_text.: I own a Canon T1i camera. In looking for a long range lens above 200mm, I read reviews on both Amazon and other commercial sites. I was looking for a lens with image quality above 200mm but did not want to incur the cost of purchasing one of the excellent Canon "L" lenses. Further, I wanted Image Stabilization and USM if possible. During reviews, I found that this zoom lens came as close to a full 5-star rating as any on the market in the non-L category. Since obtaining the lens, it has complimented my two other lenses quite nicely, one being the Canon 18-135mm "walk-around" lens and the super-fine Canon 17-55mm 2.8 IS USM non-L lens. The Bokeh is unbelievable; the sharpness of detail is as good as I could have desired. During a recent trip to the Canaveral National Seashore, I was able to get distant photos of Alligators and Roseate Spoonbill birds that were exceedingly sharp. And I was able to use the Canon IS feature to take shots at 250-300mm without a tripod.I now find that I am spoiled. While I went into this purchase with my eyes wide open, this lens starts at 70mm; my great 17-55mm lens ends at 55mm. While my 18-135mm is a very good walk-around lens, I find myself missing the image quality that I have with my 17-55mm and the 70-300mm lenses. This causes me, so far, to do most of my shooting with the 17-55mm and the 70-300mm creating the need to change lenses too frequently between the 17-55mm and the 70-300mm. I give up the walk-around feature that I enjoyed with the 18-135mm. Perhaps this will change in time and I will again start using my older 18-135mm for the purpose intended - a walk-around lens that I keep on my camera most of the time. But as I said, I have really been spoiled with this new 70-300mm lens.
$SUMMARY.: Superior lens for the price

His only complaint is that he can't use them to speak on the phone - which is not something they're designed for! So I'm pleased that the sounds quality is great, he definitely can't hear when he's listening to his music - I literally have to tap him on the shoulder, and he has to pull them out, not just turn down the music - so these are excellent

Cool color too, and easy to be sure that the kiddos don't accidentally grab daddy's  set!

$review_text.: These headphones are rated pretty high, but not from anyone who has owned a pair of them for a significant period of time. So let me fill you in on some serious quality issues I have seen after owning a pair for about 6 years (in the order the events occured). Mind you I have always babied these things and kept them in the hard case, so thats why I find this particulary disturbing (well, that, and the fact that they cost $300).1. About 3 years ago, as I was adjusting the headband, I noticed that the plastic had broken where the two pieces slide into one another. It was bad enough that crazy glue was not an option. So I contacted Bose fully expecting to be able to get them repaired or replaced for a reasonable fee. No such luck. The Bose rep told me I could purchase another pair, period. He may have offered a discount, but it must not have been a very good discount because I recall ripping him a new one for such bad support. I was going to throw them away, but I took one more look at the damage and decided the try to fix the broken area with some tightly wound electrical tape. This worked well enough, so I kept them, determined to get a few more months out of them.2. About a year ago I noticed that the on/off switch was intermittant. You have to push extra hard to the right to get the red light to come on. Wierd, but I can live with that.3. This past weekend I placed the headphone earpieces down on my dads fine wood clothing bureau and when I picked them up a few hours later I noticed that some of the soft cushion had stuck to the wood! It appears that the cushion is deteriorating!! There were little black cushion bits everywhere. There was nothing on the wood surface to cause this, except possibly for some very light wood polish.Now, these things would be forgivable if this was a cheap pair of headphones, but this is BOSE for gosh sakes, and these cost $300! Whats up with that? You buy a brand like Bose precisely becuase you assume the quality after 6 years will be excellent, not just fair or good.So, yes, the sound quality is very good. And I am sure they have made some design changes in the past 6 years. But the overall quality of the pair that I have is  most certainly NOT good. Have they addressed all of these issues in the current model? I have no idea. The BOSE rep did not tell me about if they did. But based on my experience I am very dissapointed in BOSE and will never again waste my hard earned money on a pair of thier headphones again. There are plenty of other noise cancelling headphones out there that are just as good, for alot less $$. My advice is shop around and consider this review before you fork over big bucks for these headphones.

$review_text.: I will vouch for anything Logitech.  I am not saying this because I am a vine member, but because I have a lot of things that are Logitech, and they are all great products (including microphones and keyboards).  The only thing I was disappointed in from Logitech was my old webcam the "Pro 5000".  Maybe I was just disillusioned because I thought it would work like a real camera, but either way it didn't perform up to snuff for the price I paid for it  (its retail was $80.00).When I received the "QuickCam Pro 9000" I was very leery because of my past experience (right or wrong).  I read the fancy description of the box about its lenses being designed by Carl Zeiss.  He is makes lenses for space exploration, so I thought "Well, maybe this is higher quality than my last one..."  However, I was not holding out hope.As usual the set-up was very simple; just put in the disc and install the Logitech software and then plug in the webcam.  So, I did that and then started using the camera immediately.  I am sad to say that I didn't think it was a whole lot better than the Pro 5000, except a couple details.1.  The sound quality is far better than it was on the Pro 5000.  Things were a little bit better synchronized with my face and it just picked up my voice better overall.2.  The picture quality is less grainy.  The picture quality on this camera is top-notch, not at all grainy like the Pro 5000.  I was very much impressed with the visual quality of the ProCam 9000 .I wish I could've taken back my old camera and paid the extra $20.00 because the sound quality and picture quality are that much better on the Pro9000.  The other features on this one are basically the same as their other cameras because it comes with the same software is the other camera. Still, if you are looking for a decent webcam that is $100.00 or less, I would say that you cannot go wrong with this one.God Bless & *enjoy*  ~Amy

$REVIEW.: APC, generally, makes very good quality UPS's. This is an entry-level UPS, so do not expect more than a couple minutes of runtime if you have a computer plugged in to it. (This was purchased to provide backup to a cordless phone base station. In this application, the UPS provides 90+ minutes of runtime.)One thing to keep in mind is that only 4 of the 8 plugs are UPS protected. All 8 plugs provide conditioned power.A nice feature is that one of the outlets is offset from the others. That way you can plug in an AC transformer without it covering half of the neighboring plugs.

$review_text.: I purchased a Samsung HMX-100N demonstrator without any accessory (just the camcorder) from Fry's Electronics at a steal of a deal, about 20% of the cost of a new camcorder

 So I spent another 20% to buy the original Samsung brand battery and AC adapter


I'm glad I did.While shopping for this camcorder, I found three battery price levels: about $10, $20, and this genuine Samsung battery

 I have experienced not so good luck buying the least expensive batteries for a different device, so that was out


When I saw the original Samsung battery is only 10% more than second-tier batteries (and none of them were name brands one sees in retail electronics shops), I figured why not?Not having an original battery to start with, this turned out to be a good strategy
I don't mind paying half for a decent battery, especially if I have the original as a back-up

 But original brand batteries tend to be around $30-50

At this price, you can't go wrong with a Samsung brand battery.

$REVIEW.: I owned a Macair for about 2y, sold it now to get this one. Definitely love the screen and 8G and 256G is enough; I run wmware with Win7X64 and RedHat Enterprise as virtual machines.No freezing issues like others experienced (mouse or keyboard). The reason for 4 starts only is because at this price apple should have included I7 dual core.It's very light, and I see that apple is slowly offering more for the same money due to competition. Another thing is (typical apple)is the inability to set up the screen at retina display with only what apple supplied. One has to download a 3rd party app to do that (which needs to be started upon reboot, or at least set up to the resolution you want), which is unacceptable. With all that being said is not really easy to use the display at that resolution, but still that option should be left with the buyer.Another thing I can't stand with Apple laptops is that the SD sticks out way too much, and could potentially break.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the predecessor which cause me to buy this unit

 Though I'm not a big fan of noise canceling this feature is nice


 The feature is better than Bose Headphones I have listened to.I won't go into of features too since it will be like said or has been said already

i.e
(The best sounding MMP/DAP out there and the best DAP since MiniDisc and the Atrac format.Awesome battery life,ect.)One feature that is overlooked and cause anguish for many is the lack of iTune support, not exactly
 You can drag and drop from you file with is great for video, photos,(which I always had issues with my iPods), music collections that are small (under 2,000 songs).What do you do if you have a butt load of songs or use to iTunes or have playlist?Answer:  You open iTunes and Media Manager for Walkman (assuming you have it installed-it is free)

In iTunes you highlight your playlist or what music you want and drag it over to Media Manager and boom...your music is transfered
 I have tried to drag and drop to the player itself from iTumes..
it doesn't work


 NOTE: this is not the perfect solution but it is easy
 Since Sony can't write decent software
This is a working solution to all those iTune users.I like the video on my Sony and rewind or ff is better than iPod in fact it is more like using a DVD player because you can adjust the seed of you search by pressing the button of the direction you wish to go.The user interface is clean as a breeze to use and the design is clean
 If you are into music and not one of those who just need sound but listening to quality reproduction than go out and buy this player
 After all when is the last time you heard someone mugged for a Sony?

They're totally disposable!Beats using a zip tie hands down.  They're not tough on the cables, and don't need cutters to finish off or remove.  Can be reused, and are very sticky/strong once in place8 inches long but gives you more like 6&#34; of usable diameter, because they're too flimsy at the very ends (they have to overlap some).  Also, the entire length is Velcro, and thus totally adjustable and reversible....you don't have to line up the spots to make them stick.I have these All over my office and data center to manage cables.

Strong, sturdy, spring-loaded, incredible (and variable) footprint, solid feeling without being "heavy." I won't hesitate to use these outdoors in wind. (Can't say the same about the much lighter brand I ordered from Amazon last year.) I also wouldn't hesitate to mount my 40D on one of these, if necessary. (I would not even CONSIDER doing that with the other brand which, by comparison, seems fairly useless now.)These will easily and securely hold an umbrella mount and umbrella, lightbox (with multiple Speedlites), extension arm, etc.I cannot imagine that there is a better deal on lightstands of this quality (yes, they're "professional" quality) anywhere.Securely packaged and shipped fast.GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT DEAL!

$REVIEW.: Back in 2008 I bought two HDMI cables by Monster from Best Buy at $89.99 apiece.Hind sight really is 20/20. No offense to Monster they make some excellent products but you pay more for name then the quality. Gold plating on the connector sounds nice but research shows any improvement in connectivity is minimal to none.I purchased this cable for a new Roku and it performs beautifully. Gorgeous picture and sound. Great Quality to boot. The cable arrives with plastic protective covers over the connection ports - the braided version is worth the few extra dollars. Braided cable is extremely sturdy and much less prone to damage, the molded covering, the connections are all as perfect as it gets.Comparing apples to apples  - the same cable by the big names run from $59.95 to a whopping $99.99 - make no mistake, this is an exceptional buy.A quick comment about the packaging.The Amazon frustration free packaging is sensational. In the past I would usually opt for retail packaging. But all to often opening these plastic clam shell fort Knox cases are a nightmare. Not to mention, a disaster for the environment. The Frustration Free packaging is 100% hassle free and is completely bio degradable. I now make it  a point to opt for this packaging whenever it's offered.As for the cable it's a terrific product and a stunning deal.

$REVIEW.: Well SmartWare isn't really removed, simply 'hidden'.  That's good enough it doesn't get in the way of how I want to use this drive.  I was concerned when I bought it about the built-in backup software but fortunately I didn't even have the annoyance of seeing it load once (set-up the drive on my mac).  I formatted the drive to FAT32 and it's working fine on my Snow Leopard Macbook Pro, my Windows 7 Desktop and as an external drive for my PS3 Slim.  I also have a Seagate FreeAgent Desktop USB drive which never worked right.  No matter what I had it hooked up to it would constantly discnonnect; the WD drive has been serving up a steady stream of mp3s to my PS3 for the last hour (the Seagate couldn't even make it through a single song).  So I'm happy.  The fact that I did have to go through the albeit expected hassle of disabling the Virtual CD drive is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.  Western Digital should be commended for listening to their customers and providing the means to disable the junky SmartWare.  1.5 TB for $169 seems a little like science fiction.

$REVIEW.: The product must be assembled
Easy to do, but odd.The tilt requires you to adjust a screw, however it is too weak to hold the angle with that one weak screw
Plus it is hard to get your hand in behind the tv to adjust

Your TV will hang tilted down, the only thing stopping it is when the bottom of the tv touches the wall


That will give you a two-three inch gap on top.Also, it mounts very tight to the wall, only a 1/2&#34; gap
So if you plug your tv into a socket behind the wall, you will have an issue, the plug will interfere with the mount.

I am terrible at closing the disc again (I have to make my husband do it), but I have been that way with every disc I have ever used. Bottom line, for the price you can't beat it and it is a good size - big enough for your needs but easy to tote around with your other gear.

$review_text.: Wilife Digital Security System is the first video security system I've had that really works . . . at least part of the time.  But it's a far cry from foolproof.  And I'll admit to being something of a fool when it comes to electronics.I wanted this system to be able to look in on my sleeping mother (she has Alzheimer's disease) without waking her.  And it turns out that the system is pretty good for that purpose, sometimes.  Here's what I experienced:The GoodHaving this system in a bedroom where you want to look in on a baby or elder sometimes requires seeing in the dark.  This camera is surprisingly good at producing an image in light where your eye fails to register an image.  Lighten up your screen, if necessary, but you won't have to turn on a light to disturb your sleeper.The images produced are at or above the level of security cameras I've seen.  Good, but not great.  And good is enough to accomplish my purpose.So far, so good, but wait!  There's more.The BadInstalling this system was anything but the 15-minute breeze promised by the Logitech blurb.  I ended up calling their support number (the rep was helpful and pleasant) and finally resolved the problem with new software.  (six hours)I wasn't done yet.  The software needed to recognize the camera - and that took several trips to the Knowledge base to resolve.  Turns out this system does not work or play well with my firewall (or my virus protection), so all those programs had to be turned off in order for camera recognition to occur (another four hours).Then my sleeper complained about the brightness of the light on the spy clock.  I toned it down with a sheet of paper cut to fit the display, and she was pacified (another hour).  Had I not taken this step, she would have removed the camera from her room, and the whole exercise would have been for naught.The UglyThe system refused to work at all this morning.  Apparently, another program was interfering with recognition of the USB device, so I had to go through the entire install procedure again (another hour and 1/2).  By this time, my temper is becoming frayed at the edges, and I'm wondering if it's really worth the effort I'm putting in to it.ConclusionImage quality is good enough for my purposes, and leaving my dedicated computer on all the time, I believe I can maintain contact with the camera.  So, for me it's worth it.However, you shouldn't have to be a computer wizard to set this system up and get it working.  Installation should be the breeze promised - but for me it was not!Three stars!

$review_text.: I purchased and installed this into an older white MacBook. The speed improvement was very obvious when booting, restarting, and opening apps. My laptop now runs OSX Mountain Lion just fine. Unfortunately, even with this SSD, Apple will not let you utilize the new features in Mountain lion such as Power Nap. Oh well, this upgrade was well worth it and completely revived my old MacBook. It is now just as fast as my 2012 MacBook air. One thing that people might not know is that in addition to the slight weight reduction and no more hard drive clicking, it significantly improves your battery life because of its ultra low power usage. My white MacBook used to get about 5 hours before I install this drive. Now it gets about eight. It's a huge improvement in battery life! My computer also runs cooler so I can leave it on my lap for longer than I used to with a traditional hard drive; now I also do not have to worry so much about the safety of my data if my laptop gets bumped or dropped.

The boot time with the Samsung SSD 1TB drive was 45 seconds faster than the traditional hard drive.I've had it running for 3-4 months now with not one problem!This SSD also weighs about 1/3 the traditional HDD so it also cut back on the weight of my (already heavy) MBP 17.Love this drive!

$review_text.: These arrived just a few days ago.  I've gotta say, for the few minutes I have listened to them, they sound awesome!  I typically have trouble with any in-ear headphone design (I guess I have a small ear canal or something) but I found a great fit so far with the different options of seals included.  The sound...WOW!  I never thought you could get such dynamic sound from an in-ear headphone!  I was very surprised at the bass response (coupled with my Sansa Clip Zip) and heard details in my music  that I have never heard before from any source!  And they're beautiful on top of it all!  I also actually like the cotton pouch...it is perfect to fit the headphones and my music player.  One strange thing...my package did not include a cable clip.  Not sure why?  I'll contact Amazon about it because it is something I would definitely use.  However, it does not affect my review of the product.  From first glance, I'm giving the product five starts, which is unlikely to change with use.  Good job Thinksound!

$review_text.: I have the original "Zagg Mate" case/keyboard for the first iPad.  For the most part, I liked that case: a perfect fit for the iPad, but the keyboard was kind of cramped.At first glance, this new case for the iPad 2 (made by Zagg, sold by Logitech) looks extremely similar to the original.  However, there are several noteworthy improvements over the original:1) First and foremost, the keyboard is noticably more spacious.  Slightly smaller enter/tab/shift/caps lock keys, and some other minor rearranging has led to keys that have a little more space between them, both horizontally and vertically.  On the old Zagg Mate, I frequently typed the incorrect keys.  On this one (I'm using it now to type this review), the layout is perfect for my hands.2) It's easier than it used to be to set up the iPad on the stand.  On the old Zagg Mate, there was a little flip-up holder that needed to be set up to hold the iPad in its place.  On this version, there is no need for the flip-up.  Whether you want the iPad in portrait or landscape mode, just set it in the slot and go.3) Other minor improvements: dedicated cut/copy/paste keys, magnets that turn on/off the iPad 2 (just like the smart cover), and easy bluetooth connectivity all help to make this a great keyboard/case.Final verdict: This is a great case!  I was hesitant to get it because of my experience with the original version, but this one is a great big step forward!

$REVIEW.: I chose this cover because there isn't an Otter Box made for a 7&#34; Kindle Fire. It is just an ok product. There is no screen cover so that had to be purchased separately and the cover simply gets in the way. It is suppose to fold on to itself and allow the KF to sit at an angle but the channel barely holds it, which means don't put too much pressure or force on the touch screen. That being said it is lightweight and substantial enough to protect the KF, I just would not have purchased it if I had seen it before I bought it.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this UPS for about six months. It keeps my computer alive during brief outages, and seems to do a good job filtering electrical noise. I basically really like this UPS. My only harware-related criticism is that there seems to be no way to keep the cool display lit permanently while the UPS is on mains power. Maybe there's a way to set this through the Cyberpower Software? Maybe...but I'll never know.What I hate about this product is that the software that comes with this UPS is deficient. In point of fact, it does not work for me at all. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the original and the newest version of the CP software on my PC (Windows 7, i5 64 bit quad core processor, 8G of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 video card), but it never works. The icon appears in my taskbar, but the program will not open. Process Manager shows that it's running, but the GUI never shows up. Each time I reinstall the program, the first time I try to start the GUI, I get a small white window in the middle of my screen. All subsequent attempts to run the GUI result in nothing at all.What I wanted to do was set actions to be taken when the PC is running off the UPS battery. For example, I wanted to set the point at which the PC would shut down, what the max CPU percentage would be, the cooling policy, etc. And oh yeah, set the blinkenlights to stay on. My last UPS was an APC, and their software was really nice. In addition to a user friendly GUI to set when the PC should perform an orderly shutdown during a power failure, it showed me a history of power failure or line noise incidents. But the APC had no blinkenlights at all!I called CyberPower support, but was told they had no idea what was wrong, and they didn't seem to care much about my problem. It's possible that my PC's hardware specs are uncommon (it's homebrew), but it doesn't seem all that arcane to me. It's not overclocked, everything is running vanilla. Personally, I think it may be a compatibility problem with the video card or drivers. This software may work for everyone but me, however I can only rate a product based on my own experiences, and I am dissatisfied with at least this aspect of the product, and seriously irritated by CP's lackadaisical tech support.What especially frustrated me was the inability to set the shutdown point for my PC when the UPS battery gets too low. The "Power Options" in the control panel didn't seem to know about the UPS, and--oddly--no "Battery" options were present. I now think the CyberPower software took control of the UPS from the OS. However, I did figure out how to fix this: I just now uninstalled the CyberPower software (for the last time), and found that the Windows 7 Control Panel power options now permit me to select actions to be taken on low battery conditions!I think that if CP is not going to support their software, they should just sell the UPS with directions on how to set the power options through the Control Panel, and forget about distributing the software at all.

$REVIEW.: I paid $12 for this thing, and what a deal that was.  This device will allow you to connect up 3 HDMI devices to a TV, for example, that only has one.  The unit gets power over HDMI, so no need to use a power supply, it doesn't come with one if you do somehow need one.  It comes with a remote and IR sensor, for switching between the 3, however, it senses which one is connected so you really don't need the remote.  For example, I have a TV with only one HDMI input.  I want to connect my DirecTV receiver and my WD TV Live Plus Media Player.  When I turn on the media player, it will switch to that input, when I turn on the DirecTv receiver, it will switch to that.  Pretty simple.  Absolutely no setup.  Awesome product.  Ok, now for the con(s), they put a LED to show which input is high.  This LED is too bright and will actually make it annoying while sleeping.  But, that is what tape is for.Get this thing...

Sorry Mom, but I feel I've got to warn others that there may be better choices.My wife bought this DVD player as JVC was considered a good brand & the saleman told her it was. Yes, it played DVDs, but it could not rewind (play backwards) or fast forward. If those buttons were pushed, this JVC DVD player jumped to random places in the DVD. The controller also had to be within a narrow range (reception cone) to work. My previous Panasonic DVD, which died suddenly, could receive almost anywhere. I also had trouble with the closed caption being properly displayed.Finally, who designed the black buttons on a black background? Even in bright light they were difficult to see & read, let alone the dim light most TV viewing is done in.Seems like all DVD players now suffer from having to be China-Cheap & are designed to be poorly designed, frustrating, throwaway items.

$REVIEW.: I had debated whether or not to buy one of these until one evening I watched some very old home movies with the kids and realized that we hardly ever recorded anything anymore.We have a "normal" camcorder but end up not using it very much - it's just too much work to drag it out, get it turned on, find a tape, and get it started it (and it seems like the battery is always low).With the Flip, however, it's about as quick to get up and running as a digital camera - just grab it and turn it on. Now we capture moments on video all the time.The video quality is actually quite good. At first I thought the 1 hour limit on storage would be a problem, but then I realized I pretty much never need to record that much continuous time anyway.

$REVIEW.: Some reviewers commented about the build quality of this lens.I agree it is a little light and flimsy-feeling but it's held together well and I've been using it quite a lot.Now, on to what matters! The images from this lens are beautiful! at f/1.8 max. aperture it's wonderful for using natural light indoors - the resulting images have been warm and saturated. Sure Canon offers F/1.4 and 1.2 versions that are much sturdier etc.  but it's the price that makes this one a winner.  It doesn't cost a lot to "check out" this lens and I haven't been disappointed. There are times that I wish it were a zoom, but I've gotten used to just backing up or moving closer. And consider, a comprable zoom in this range would either be much slower, or faaarrr more expen$ive. And even then you'd be hard pressed to find a zoom that's as sharp.I recommend it to anyone in the novice to avid-amateur status range. Snooty pros and people with unlimited budgets please disregard my humble advice (until I become one of you - preferably the unlimited budget thing . . . ) at that time my reviews may be of value to even you.

$review_text.: The instructions were easy to follow and the set up was accomplished in just a few minutes as advertised. Even the firmware update was simple to complete. With this said, the instructions are lacking on how to use the remote that came with the receiver/transmitter or more importantly that you need the source remote to control the device. This may seem obvious, but a small remote did come in the package and even had an up and down buttons to suggest you could change the channels.I was hooking up a TV in my office area so I could watch football on Sundays as these days it seems I'm always working weekends and wanted a way to watch football off a direct TV receiver that neither my wife nor my kids would likely be using during the day. The solution was to connect the transmitter to the DVR unit we have in our bedroom which again took all of two minutes. My office is in the basement while our bedroom is on the first floor but on the opposite side of the house so the signal had to go through a floor and a few walls. The signal was still very strong with no flicker or other video feed disruptions.If it was possible, I would have given the product a score of 4.5 as I couldn't give the product five stars (although the reception is like watching my bedroom TV) but for the fact the instructions could be a bit clearer.

$REVIEW.: This is compatible with the PS3, all specs fit PS3 requirement

It works with all PS models (Original, Slim and Super Slim) I've tested them all
If you have a PS Plus subscription, or someone that buys there games off of PSN


This is a must buy.I don't have any issue with the HDD itself


I've had it over an year now, and it's been work fine
It's nice to have all my game downloaded and not having to delete and re-download games I want to play

My only tip is not to fill the HDD all the way

Leave about 100GB free


Sometimes HDD get all weird when you fill them up to max capacity.Installing the HDD are pretty simple

Each PS models has the HDD in a different place, but installing each drive is the same
Just the access points are different.I give this product, Seagate Momentus 1 TB 5400RPM by Seaget a 5 out of 5

$REVIEW.: I have had an Acer Aspire One AO150 for a few years and have been very pleased with it

Unfortunately, it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April

I really didn't want Windows 8 so I felt between a rock and a hard place
The V5 has helped me escape this dilemma.While small and light, with great battery time owing to its 6-cell battery, my Aspire One was a netbook, i.e

it had alimited Atom CPU and 1GB of memory, not really enough power to handle upgrading
The V5 doesn't have those limitations

With a Celeron CPU, 4GB memory , 500GB HDD, a full 1366x768 display and HDMI, it has all the features of a low-end 15&#34; laptop but only weighs 3 lbs


The V5 also has the 6-cell pack and hopefully has the same battery life as the smaller Aspire One.One thing I really liked about the Aspire One was its keyboard, which was small but had a nice feel, not cheap like the Asus eeePC


The V5 has the same feel but its keyboard about the same size as a 15&#34; PC, so it's easy to type on.I really don't know why anyone would want to buy an overpriced, underpowered tablet when the Acer V5 has most of the features ( light weight, long battery life ) and none of the hassles one can have using a tablet


Many people end up adding a keyboard to their tablet - this one has a nice keyboard built-in and only 480+GB more disk space


In sum, the V5 is a real computer, only just a little smaller.

$review_text.: I purchased this to convert a 3-year-old HP desktop into a DVR for over-the-air digital TV, and it works exactly as I'd hoped. A few notes:1. Although many Windows computers will automatically download the drivers for this tuner, those drivers will often be out of date. Be sure to download the latest drivers from the Hauppauge website. (If you're using Windows Media Center, it'll hang while trying to find signals if you're using an outdated driver.)2. If you have a computer with Windows Media Center, you won't need the software that comes with this tuner; Windows Media Center automatically detected the card and TV signals (after I updated the drivers), and it's an intuitive, robust program that works like a charm.3. The antenna that comes with this tuner will only suffice if you live in a metropolitan area where all of the broadcast signals generate within a 10-mile radius; the rest of us will need a heftier antenna. The Mohu Leaf is a good option, although I use the ChannelMaster DB8 since many of our local broadcasts generate from 30+ miles away.4. I don't know if the included remote will work with Windows Media Center, but I use theLogitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad. It's inexpensive, lightweight, small, easy to use, and has a wireless range of 33 feet.With all of that said, this is a good product if you've ditched cable but still want to be able to record your favorite programs. And for the record, my computer is connected to a 720 HDTV via a VGA cable and male-to-male stereo cable. The picture isn't as good as when the coax was plugged directly into the TV, but it's still quite good. If you have the option of connecting your computer and TV via HDMI, the picture should be excellent.

$review_text.: I am always looking for a new Palm handheld that is affordable but has a lot of great features. Most of the latest models that have been coming out have been focusing more on wireless capabilitie than function and affordability. Well I think the Palm Zire 71 is getting them back on track.This device is reasonably priced... what the Palm m500 cost when it was initially released, which is saying a lot considering the differences between the two models. For the most part everything new is simply a refinement to an already simplified and easy to use device.A hidden camera, high-res color screen, a better directional navigation, more memory... this thing has just about everything I have been looking for short of a sliding keyboard. If they would keep the stylus writing area and stil find room for a Thumboard I would be sold in a heart beat.The only thing I don't lie about this new model is the color. They have been staying fairly consistent with plain metallic cases. Had they stuck to their guns with this model I would be sold.In the mean time I'll continue to play with the display models in Staples.

$review_text.: If you are looking for a product that doubles as both a GMRS and a marine radio, you have probably found this product

 From the specs, it looks good, and using on dry land, it is fine, but once you use the submersible attribute of the product, that is when the problems start.I bought this product to replace the 2 radios I had been carrying in waterproof bag

 Initially, this product was a god send, it was compact, did 2 functions in just one radio, and didn't need a waterproof bag
 The problem is that one the product is submersed, it stops working as intended.The first one of these I had was submersed in water of about .5 meters for only a few seconds while in my life jacket

 After that, the sound levels dropped drastically and functions started to change sporadically without me trying to change them
 Cobra was very helpful and sent me an RMA and replaced the product.The second radio I got (the replacement) befell a similar fate again after being momentarily submersed
 This time, the radio began to pick up rogue transmission that weren't on any of the channels I was monitoring


 Cobra was again helpful in replacing the device.The third radio (the replacement's replacement) is now kept in a sealed waterproof bag where I haven't had any trouble with it yet, but the purpose of getting a submersible radio is defeated if it can't be submersed without failing.If you have plans on keeping the radio high and dry, it is a good radio with a wide feature set and decent reception, but if you are like me and need a radio that can get submersed, I would highly recommend staying away from this one.

$review_text.: I'm sorta new to off-camera lighting, so I picked up this flash meter for one reason only: its about 4 times cheaper than ANY other flash meter on the market.Ok - the battery door is hard to close, but yes it does indeed close and once it is closed it is closed pretty good.  You just have to press the top edge of the battery door shut a with a bit of pressure, before pushing the other end in.  Once the top end locks in - the rest will snap right in place.The thing couldn't be easier to use.  I've used a digital meter, and this is JUST as a straightforward (maybe more so).  Its hard to see from the image how it works - but on that big dial (which you adjust the ISO) the F numbers are printed.  You turn on the unit, and it is ready to receive a flash.  If you have the flash connected with a pc synch you can just press the flash button on the meter to remotely fire it.  Or even better, if you are using RF triggers, and you have a little PC to 1/8th jack cord, you can connect it to your RF trigger and fire your flash remotely! (Check out the picture I uploaded for how it connects). Otherwise, manually fire off your flash and the an LED will light up behind the corresponding F number.  On top of the meter you will see LED lights for 1/3 and 2/3 F stops.This is because just about every camera reads F stops in third increments.  So if you didnt know, the difference between F8 and F11 is a 1 full stop (not three), so F9 is really F8 and 1/3rd, and F10 is F8 and 2/3rds.This is very simple to figure out.  If your meter lights up with F8 and the 1/3 stop light also - than the exposure is F9.  If you cant figure it out - tune your camera to the number on the dial (F8), and if there is an additional 1/3 stop lit up - simply tune your aperture on your camera one more notch, if the 2/3 lights up tune it 2 notches on the dial of your camera.I dont have anything to calibrate against, but the exposure seems pretty spot on - and even if it was off at all (as I said, I'm not a lighting expert...yet), the exposure is consistent.  I've read someone having trouble having it read the flash - it didnt miss a single flash of mine and I tried it all distances and power levels.I hate the picture they have of this thing, it makes it look pretty chintzy - but its actually not.  Its a fair size, kinda thick, and its got a decent build, a decent weight to it, comes with a short lanyard (i'll probably get a neck lanyard though), and a nice leather (or leather-like) case.So if you're not sure if it works, check out the photo I posted of the unit.  I use a completely manual off-camera flash, I tuned in a flash power that I thought was appropriate (bounced off a card) and read it with the meter.  I dialed in exactly what it read onto my camera and took the shot.  If you think my image is properly exposed (I do), then it works!I'm quite happy with the purchase.

 First, they didn't arrive until January 8 and secondly, they work poorly
 The one I took out of the package to see how well they worked started flashing like small strobe lights


 When the flashing subsided, 6 of the 11 LEDs had stopped working


 I just threw the whole package in the trash

 Maybe the low price should have tipped me off: You get what you pay for


 OR, maybe that is the energy savings part of the deal; less than half of the LEDs work saving you over half of the energy cost.

Quite frankly, I always preferred the HD DVD format over Blu-Ray. a much better menu system and IMHO better quality. I also own a Toshiba A2 HD DVD player and about 25 HD DVDs. I Was disheartened when the HD DVD format fell by the wayside. The good news to HD DVD fans is that this LG Super Blu combo unit lets you have your Hi-Def cake and eat it to. Now I buy bargain HD DVDs for past titles and Blu-Ray for new releases. Shop around for deals and you can find this unit considerably less than here.

$review_text.: This is a really small speaker with big sound! I was very impressed with the sound quality the first time I tried it out as soon as I got it. Then I realized that it 'pops' open in order to provide even better sound and bass! For such a small, battery powered speaker, the sound quality is really good. Plus, the small size makes it very convenient to take with you practically anywhere.It is very convenient that it has an audio cord built in, so you can use this to play music from anyone's device. Only thing I would recommend is having a longer audio cord to use when possible, as the included cable is short. But that isn't necessary.The possible uses for this mini speaker are endless, but to name just one, I have used it in the car to play audio from my phone (music, podcasts, videos, etc.) because I do not have Bluetooth connections or an auxiliary jack in my car. This speaker lets everyone in my car be able to hear the sounds!

$REVIEW.: Before buying this, I had a mix of cables, plus an older, but good quality HDMI switch.  When I got AT&T; uVerse, I began having problems with errors flashing on the screen for HDCP, sometimes not allowing me to watch.I really wasn't sure of the cause, so I replaced the old cables, and also replaced the switch with a cheap, new switch at the same time.  I had no problems after that.It probably wasn't the cables that caused the problem, but I can say that the new cables were high quality and caused no problems with my picky source.

$REVIEW.: This is a horrible router with intermittent dropped wireless connection.  I am more than capable of installing routers.  I've been doing them for 10 years.  I've tried many of the settings to make this wireless router work.I've updated the firmware, adjusted the MTU, changed the channels, Beacon Interval, Frag pack time, etc. etc.  I've basically tried and changed each setting and it still has wireless dropping problems on several computers.It's not my connection either. I dusted off an old Netgear and Dlink router and they both work with the Comcast connection.I've done everything possible to try and make this router work consistently, but it doesn't.  It's this router plain and simple.  It's garbage.

$review_text.: These are in ear monitor earbuds. They are designed to be worn with the cord looping around your ear and the earpeice resting within your ear canal, not straight down with the earpeice in the air. You essentially slid the cord around the back of your ear then rotate the earpiece 180 degrees so that the rubber tips fit into your ears.Most of the not so good reviews seem to be from folk wearing them incorrectly.See the picture below for an example of how to wear them.https://www.google.com/search?q=Monoprice+108320&oe;=utf-8&aq;=t&rls;=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client;=firefox-a&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&ei;=RScHUuzuBOSb2QWW9oDQAw&biw;=1366&bih;=572&sei;=SycHUq7cNLH62AXTooAI#facrc=_&imgdii;=_&imgrc;=doxiR_iDWaW07M%3A%3BsudncrW7al8LcM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fecx.images-amazon.com%252Fimages%252FI%252F51lFhEBwv6L.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252FMonoprice-108320-Enhanced-Isolating-Earphones%252Fdp%252FB007VEQ2UU%3B500%3B322Once you put them on correctly, you'll realize what it seems 1,000s of others have..these are the best 10$ headphones you will ever find. I listened to Modest Mouse "Good News for People Who Love Bad News" hundred of times before now, on dozens of different headphones. Hearing them through these revealed details and changes to the balancing of the songs I had never picked up before. The bass is pronounced but not overwhelming (common problem at this price point) and the mids are very warm. Surprisingly good build quality as well (at least for the all black version.. the silver version looks like it might be made of cheaper, less robust plastic). Generally I have a hard time thinking what other thing one can buy for 10 bucks that performs so well. From my experience they can hang with most headphones in the 40-60 dollar range for sound quality and probably quite a few around 100$.

$REVIEW.: Under the Amazon Vines program, I had requested this case for the Kindle Paperwhite, and instead one arrived for the Kindle Fire. Before asking for an exchange, I figured I would check out the quality of the case to see if I wanted to go through the hassle. Turns out I don't. The primary problem is that the case is nearly impossible to open. The instructions are unclear, and when I went to the website address given on the instructions for an installation demonstration video, there was none. The demonstration video on the Amazon item page is useless. The first step is supposedly removing the outer bumper by &#34;pealing&#34; back one of the corners. It seemed to be impossible without crushing the case or cracking the clear cover, so I never got beyond that. I'm very content with the official Kindle Paperwhite case I have now, since I don't plan on going swimming with my Kindle. Another problem I can see with the case is that the clear covering is very shiny, which would cause terrible reflections. That added to the many other comments about the difficulty of installing the device in the case (not to mention removing it) gives me no desire to try this brand again with an actual Paperwhite version.
$SUMMARY.: Wrong case sent, but I don't really care...

$REVIEW.: I bought this mainly for the green screen but extra light can always help. The green screen was great and the stand is very nicely built. I've set it up and down over a dozen times and it's still working great. The fabric isn't as dense as I'd like. Any light behind it can be seen. The extra lights are great for lighting a subject but not nearly enough light for the green screen. You'll still need two 500 watt lamps to really light the green to a proper value you can key. Still a good product for the price though.

$REVIEW.: The Sigma 50-500 F/4.5-6.3 APO DG HSM SLD Ultra is a reasonable compromise between shorter and longer lenses.  I use it on both a Canon T4i (using the additional lens hood adapter for the APS-C camera) and a Canon 5DIII using the standard Sigma full-frame lens hood.The lens is large, heavy, but physically sound. It comes with a well-padded carrying case that has room for both lens hoods, if you follow the instructions on how to connect these hoods for storage.  Most switches on  the lens are firm, although the autofocus/manual switch is easy to accidentally reset, for example if the camera is being carried by a side-strap and the lens brushes your leg.The lens falls short of its advertised 500mm capability.  Unfortunately, its sweet-spot falls around 300mm.  It is soft at the 500 end of the range and fairly useless at the 50mm end of the range.I purchased this lens to help with photography of birds in flight and it is too soon to tell if that will be possible for me.  Although I knew the weight of the lens when I purchase it, it seem slightly out of balance when the lens is extended for higher magnification and this makes is difficult of keep the bird in the frame.  Perhaps I will need to learn a new technique to  master this lens.  I have seen flight images taken by Robert O'Toole with this lens and they are of extremely high quality, so the lens can be mastered.  Time will tell if this was the right lens for me, but it is still early in the game.  I will update you on my final conclusions after I have had more practice with this particular lens.One final comment - the lens is black and the inscriptions on the lens body are in white.  When you are zooming at 450 - 500 mm it looks as if you have unrolled a billboard of text.  Not really a functional problem, but it causes the lens to look like something found in a war surplus store.

I did need one that was firewire 400 cause my Macbook 2,1 (not pro, it is that old) does not have an 800 port
I put the Western Digital Scorpio Black 7200 320GB in there and it fit just fine
Others seem to say the WD drives are a really tight fit

Not for me, though not sure if a bigger GB capacity makes any diff as to how tight the fit is
I also read other places that the Firewire seems to go only after a few uses?? I think the off switch is really handy, that way I dont have to unplug from my laptop.Also THE LIGHT IS REALLY BRIGHT!!! I know everyone says that, but they were not kidding! I had to cover it with a double folded piece of paper so I could still see the indicator light but not be blinded by it.Really simple, just plug and play.

$review_text.: I will assume if you're looking at buying this particular camera model, then:  a. You are looking at upgrading from a point-N-shoot. Or,  b. An intermediate to advanced photographer looking for a decent backup camera. Since I have owned this camera, I have been doing a lot of shooting with a friend of mine who happens to do photography for a living. My friend uses a Fujifilm S3 pro dSLR. Let me tell you, there isn't much difference in picture quality between the $700 d40x or $2,300 S3 pro when using the same lens. Both cameras are capable of producing almost identically amazing pictures. The main difference is when buying the d40x, you can get about the same quality photos for more than 3x cheaper than an average pro-level SLR camera.If there was one thing I would do over again, I would definitely buy the d40x as a camera body only. Not that the kit lens is bad, but it's rather limiting to your d40's potential.  Having the chance to use Nikon's 18-200mm VR lens has made me a real believer of how important a really good lens is for great photography.My only major gripes about the d40x is the lack of adjustment buttons and no aperture dial the higher end dSLR's have. It can be somewhat annoying having to go into the camera's menu screen to make simple adjustments.The PRO's for sure outweigh the few CON's this camera has. It's a great dSLR camera to start out with. The only real limitations of the d40x will be the skill level of the person behind it.

$REVIEW.: Compared these head-to-head with Bose QC2 which I had owned a couple months before hearing about the A-Ts.  You will see I have a slightly different take from a couple previous reviewers; obviously personal perceptions play significantly.  Here are my results:- Noise cancellation:  About the same.  However, I hear a very noticeable hiss from the A-Ts when they're turned on in a quiet environment; the Bose NR introduces a much-reduced 'ambient' hiss.- Sound quality:  A-T much more accurate, though it would be nice to have a tad more bass.  The Bose go too far the other way, with bloated bass and recessed mids.  An added A-T advantage:  It will pass the music through even with the NR turned off (or dead battery).  The Bose plays nothing with no power.- Comfort:  Bose has edge.  Its earcups feel slightly bigger around and deeper, with less contact on my ears.  Pressure and padding feel about the same between the two.- Construction:  I can't tell much difference.  The A-Ts feel perhaps more sturdy, but it's very subtle and subjective and I wouldn't bank much on it.- Other:  Battery life is about the same, from the same single AAA battery.  Bose uses proprietary audio cord, while the A-T cord uses standard plug on both ends so would be cheaper to replace.  Both store in similar flat cases, though the A-T case is slightly thicker.- The Bose-Killer:  Price.  The QC2 is better than A-T in a couple areas but IMHO is way overpriced at $185 more--especially if you care about sound quality.
$review_summary.: Toss-Up with Bose QC2 but reasonably priced!

$REVIEW.: This bag is very sturdy and stylish. I like that I have one spot for papers/documents that has a firm separator that keeps my papers unwrinkled. The computer holding portion is ample for my 15 inch mac-book, but I'm pretty sure a 17 inch could fit in there just fine. There's spots to stick my mouse, and a little extra room for some odds and ends with the computer. Additionally there's a way to attach this to a rolling luggage case.There's a very nice spot for pens and a small zip area that has a mesh pocket so you can see what is secured in it. The zippers on the outside are all high quality and I doubt that they will malfunction any time soon, and the cases and strap are equally well put together. I haven't carried it in the rain, but I suspect it would be largely water proof. I got it for a great deal of around $40 on Amazon, but I would pay $75 for it without hesitation.

But this devise is the second generation to a popular EVA8000, NETGEAR should have perfected the device by now.The issues I have are:1) The device does not support the popular Canon 5D2. Full HD videos out of the 5D2 play without audio. This has been confirmed by Netgear, not sure is it will be supported and when.2) The interface is not suitable for a living room operation! it is difficult & weird!3) The remote control is not documented or laid out very will.

After 2 years, 300-400 trips to the land of 45s, and a lot of sweat (a lot-a lot), I'm finally having to put old Bose down. The sound deterioated a bit, and the cord that protects the wires began to tear away from the wires. The buds themselves held up wonderfully.

$REVIEW.: The image stabilizer is top notch and the array of filters, colors, themes, settings, and even camera settings is pretty impressive.getting this with a SDHC class 10 high speed card is a sweet combo.  I still wish I had it but the housekeeping in a motel in Pamona California (lemon tree i think)  stole it and thanks to motel anti-liability, apparently they arent liable if stuff comes up missing...total crap.The built in mic could be far better and you might be better off picking up the dead cat clip on mic for the top of this camera or plugging in a mic into the side.The mic port being in the side of the camera is not my favorite placement, it puts a lot of stress on the port to use something like a stage/studio mic with it jarring out sideways from the little 3.5mm jack.  Probably would have been better placed at the bottom bear the back battery.I got this Camera when it was like $417 (Not on sale) But now it seems to be far more expensive...doesn't obsolete stuff usually get CHEAPER with age?! Some sellers are dumb I guess.This camera is great with the Manfroto tripod stand that locks in place with a thumbwheel, just a thought!Would but again, wish it was cheaper! :DThe basic battery life is dissapointing and while Wasabi power 2 pack batteries (BP-727) are fantastic,  Canon has a bad habit of proprietaryness and makes it where the ONLY way to tell how much juice is in a battery is to use official canon batteries (which have a chip in the battery that syncs with the camera) so you have to guess it by testing

$review_text.: After spending a huge amount of time going through countless reviews I finally bought the ZS3 from a wholesaler with a 3 month return policy. Glad I did. It's going back tomorrow. Although the zoom was nice, Panasonic missed the boat on basics like clean focusing and noise in most iso settings.Today I took the ZS3 and my seven year old Fuji 3800 to a local park and spent about 2 hours shooting the same scenes with both cameras. No contest. The aging Fuji's shots were clean and well focused. With the ZS3 it was a crap shoot. Sometimes it was almost equal to the Fuji, but on most shots it was very disappointing. Also found the lens took too much time to retract, often hesitating and then finally retracting. Yes, the Fuji is bulky,and has trouble focusing in low light, but it runs quite nicely on four AA batteries (which unfortunately must be removed between sessions).Next on the hit parade will be the Canon G11. Should be better in low light, and the fold out LCD screen is very seductive. My recommendation is to pass on this ZS3.

$REVIEW.: I received this adapter in exchange for a review. I would love to give this a solid five stars, if for no other reason than it exceeded my expectations. I had a crashed hard drive that had been laying in my desk for years. In practically no time I was able to see and copy files that I thought were forever lost. Needless to say I was both thrilled and grateful.However, this review needs to point out the fact that I have well over thirty-five years of technical experience that enabled me to figure out how to use this on my own. Had I needed to depend on the documentation I would have been lost. That is the weak point and why I subtracted a star.The package itself is amazingly complete, and anyone who has a technical background will be pleased. There is an adapter for any SATA or IDE hard drive in 2.5 or 3.5 inch form factors that you are likely to encounter. I was able to connect using just the adapter that connects to my laptop's USB port without needing the included power supply. The drive was powered via the USB port and the wheezing old XP system immediately recognized it.If you are non-technical this will be a puzzle. First, the documentation mentions jumper settings, but does not explain what a jumper is, nor even what one looks like. A little more discussion and some illustrations showing examples would have gone a long way. And especially so since this adapter may not work if your drive is set to anything but MASTER. The last three of the six steps listed for using this are confusing if you do not need to use the included power adapter. The fact that those steps are optional may leave non-technical users baffled and spinning their wheels.The bottom line is in the hands of experienced folks who are familiar with hard drive nomenclature this is an invaluable tool. In fact I personally believe that every computer repair tech should have one of these sets in his or her tool kit.If the manufacturer were to take the time to develop clear and well illustrated documentation this kit would be a life saver (and a money saver) to average users who want to rescue files from a drive or to back up one. It's the documentation that is standing in way of a larger market as well as making the difference between this being a clever techie tool and a five star product.

 The price put me off and I just held it on my Wish List for 6 months until the price dropped a bit


 Still expensive, but you get what you pay for.There's a definite difference from cheaper polarizer filter I had been using in terms of the light loss
 F-stop or so better
 I haven't smeared my fingers all over it to test the claim that it is resistant to dirt and finger-prints, but I am sometimes a klutz changing filters - especially thin filters like this with a rotating part - and so far it has stayed clean and finger-print free

 I have DEFINITELY not tested how resistant it is to being stepped on, banged against things, etc


and I hope I don't have to.So far:  Good polarizing properties; better than normal polarizer at allowing light through; seems to stay clean well; easy for me to put on and remove; thin profile and light-weight; smooth, easy action.

$review_text.: I researched multiple cord reel's before I bought this one. I have it attached to the ceiling in my garage hooked into the garage opener plug.I chose the 13 Amp over the 10 Amp cords because if you are running a shop vac and a chop saw at the same time, as I do often, you will be above 10 Amps. My setup would run about 12.5 Amps in that example.I have it attached to a high ceiling and it was very easy to adjust stopper ball so in never reeled up to high for me to grab it.Cons (the reasons below are why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars)- As other reviews have stated the male plug is way to short, I could not put the reel where it made the most sense.- It does have issue retracting all the way, also stated in other reviews. Its not a huge deal, you can just push it up the rest of the way. However, I do keep 4 feet out all the time anyway since its mounted on a high garage ceiling.Overall I am happy with this purchase, if it starts falling apart in a few months I will be sure to update my review.

$review_text.: Update 2: Okay, sorry about this..
I've discovered this seems to do a bit worse reading rental discs than my normal Sony Blu Ray player, but after cleaning the discs it seems to be working
 Hopefully this'll be the last time I need to update the review!Okay, here's my original review, which for the most part is still relevant:I've been surprised it's taken Sony this long to release a portable Blu Ray player, considering they were one of the main companies involved in the standard

 I've been scared off by negative reports on some earlier portable players by other companies, but thought I'd take a shot on this.Random things about it:-The unit physically looks a lot like a notebook computer


 The screen opens up just like one (and it looks even more like a notebook when the screen's shut)


 It's black, and kind of a very dark blue that is easily mistaken for black
 (I'm noticing in some pictures it looks fairly bright blue, but in real life, even under bright lighting, it looks almost black-it's not garish at all in other words).-The screen can swivel around, so it's facing backwards, or folded flat against the base


 I'm not really sure why I'd want to do that, but the hinges seem to be really sturdy.-The controls on the unit itself are unfortunately touch based instead of physical buttons, but they're also indented, so they're easier to hit than they'd otherwise be
 It also comes with an almost totally normal IR remote, which works great
 (Virtually identical to the one my normal Sony Blu Ray player shipped with, except it's a little bit more compact.)-The unit's battery unfortunately seems to be sealed...I suppose if/when I ever get rid of this, I'll unscrew it and pull the battery out for recycling.-The screen is "matte", instead of the more typical "glossy" (reflective) screens used on most notebook computers

 Matte looks less flashy in stores, but actually works better, since you're not seeing reflections all the time

 I'd assume that the LCD panel itself is identical to ones used in 'netbooks'-it's the same size and resolution as the typical 'netbook'.-Unfortunately I *STILL* don't know for sure if this uses cheaper/older florescent backlighting, or LED backlighting


 For a variety of reasons, I prefer LED
 Since Sony doesn't say, you'd assume that means it's using cheaper florescent lighting...except it's fairly bright and seems to more uniformly go up and down in brightness when adjusted, the way LED backlighting typically is


 Is Sony just inexplicably not marketing a selling point on this?  I don't know for sure.-The screen itself looks good, and appears to be QUITE watchable with shows or movies
 I wasn't too impressed in the store, but it looks better at home, and better still once I actually threw a Blu Ray in


 While the resolution is "only" 1024x600 rather than a full 720p, on such a small screen, and considering you'll probably have it at least a few feet from your face, I doubt that'll make much difference


 At any rate, both DVD and Blu Rays look great, it maintains correct aspect ratios, etc.-The unit uses Sony's XMB (Cross media bar) interface they've been using for the last few years on everything from the Playstation 3/Portable, to newer TVs, and normal Blu Ray players

 It's a straight forward interface that makes adjusting settings pretty self explanatory-of course most of the time you'll just be launching a disc from the 'Video' section, so barely even using it.-Volume and sound quality through the built in speakers actually seems surprisingly good


 I don't know how it would be on a noisier environment though (a car, for example), but it seemed a bit louder and better than my typical 14" notebook, which is saying something considering this is physically smaller.-According to the manual, the unit weighs a bit over 3 lbs (also similar to notebooks using the same sized screen!)-The unit includes the aforementioned almost-normal remote, regular (and pretty small) power supply, and also an power supply for use in a car's cigarette adapter


 It also has a composite cable for connection to a TV

 Of course using composite instead of HDMI means it can't output HD, but it's still nice to have.-The unit has an HDMI port, but doesn't include an HDMI cable (most products don't include a cable, unfortunately).-It also has a proprietary part that apparently lets it accept composite INPUTS, but unfortunately doesn't include a cable for that
 Unless maybe with adapters the input cable would work?  That's theoretically a neat feature-you could display an older game system or the like on this unit's built-in screen, for example-but I'm not sure how you'd find the necessary cable (Unless the input cable would work, with three adapters).-Performance seems good
 It actually loads Blu Rays faster than my 2009 Sony Blu Ray player (which works fine, but this does seem noticeably faster)


 No complaints about that

 Every Blu Ray and DVD I've used has loaded just fine so far, just like my normal player


 DVDs seem to be scaled just fine on both the internal display and through HDMI.-Unfortunately, the headphone jacks are shut off when it's outputting HDMI (the volume controls also stop working, and the internal speakers are shut off)

 Thankfully, the monitor I'm using it with has an analog output...I'm running a cable from that to my notebook, and from that to my headphones...bit of a weird work around, but works fine
 Of course this won't matter if you're using it on a TV, or if you're using it with it's own built in screen.-Bizarrely, you don't seem to be able to shut off the internal screen when it's outputing through HDMI...it just mirror's almost everything to the external display (everything except the menu to control the internal display's brightness, contrast etc
 That menu only displays on the internal display, and the settings don't affect the external display)


 The closest I can do is just turning the brightness all the way down

 Seems like there should be a toggle to shut it off completely, but...-Like my TV and normal Blu Ray player, this has an Ethernet jack for doing firmware updates


 You plug it in, it checks, and lets you install an update if available
 For whatever reason though, while this was 'seeing' that an update was available, it couldn't download it, and eventually timed out with an error about the server not responding


 This may just be bad timing-Sony's update server might be down today or something

 I was able to work around it by downloading the update from Sony's support site (it's pretty easy to find), sticking the files on a CD-R (Sony even gives you instructions for who to do that on the support site), and sticking the disc in the player

 It took a LONG time to finish the update-felt like 10 minutes-but it worked fine.Everything actually seemed to work just fine before the update, but the release notes mentioned a few things it changed
 Of course this is probably just a one or two time thing-don't know that it'll ever need another update.So anyway, aside from the few minor issues mentioned above, so far this seems like a quality product
 The performance and compatibility seem fine


 The screen looks nice


 HDMI out works

 The remote's nice, etc
 Seems like a safe choice if you're looking for a portable player, and technically it could even be used as a normal player (except that the internal screen will be on the whole time...unless I just haven't figured out how you shut it off).

$review_text.: Yes, I've got TWO of these radios, BOTH with the SAME defect - the display and most of the buttons quit working!I thought the first one was my fault, not taking enough care to avoid direct water on the radio..


of course it died just outside the 1 year warranty period


I liked the radio (when it worked), features were awesome, ipod interface worked great, etc...So I bought a 2nd radio, and made a point to be extremely careful to avoid any direct water contact, telling everyone this as well...It worked great, and now it's doing the EXACT same thing! Worked one weekend, then the next, nothing! My boat is garaged normally and only sits outside when we're at the lake, so it's not like it spends 24/7 outside.The display is dead, nothing, most of the buttons don't work...some work, the radio still works because I can operate it via the remote.I've swapped front panels, and neither work, both have very slight different buttons and one has a couple of segments on the LCD on, nothing of any meaning.I'd say stay away from this model, and possibly Sony in general for marine radios

$REVIEW.: This is my fourth Invisible Shield (2 MacBook Pro and 2 iPod Touch). This one is a huge disappointment. While the others fit perfectly, were fairly easy to apply, and have been very durable, here's what I've found after 3 months of use of this product:- Very difficult to apply. The pieces for the top and bottom are HUGE and it's very hard to align them properly, let alone work trapped air out as you apply. None of the other Shields I've had were this hard.- The two side pieces don't fit well. This is very unusual for Zagg products. Both side products are too long, and the user must trim them if access to the DVD player and headphone jack are important.- The side/front/back pieces are also just a tad too wide. Result: after 3 months of use, all of my pieces are peeling away on the edges. Once they peel a bit more, I'll just chuck them. Zagg could have made the parts the right size and/or used better adhesives.- The top is just a little mis-sized. Current design doesn't leave quite enough overlap to give sufficient sticking surface as the top wraps around the Al MacBook Pro part. Just a little larger would have given enough sticking area. Or, Zagg could have cut the part just a little smaller and not worried about needing to have a skinny surface stick. As it is, all four corners of my top are already pulling away--and I'm very careful with how I handle and pack this machine.Installation was a pain; I ruined the first top section and, true to their promise and reputation, Zagg replaced it. That's the good news. The bad news is that they take your credit card number and require you to return an entire Shield or they'll charge your card. They don't even pay return shipping. That's part of why I'll just chuck the bad side pieces on my unit rather than return it for "free" replacement.Oh: if you need to remove a large piece of Shield as I did, WOW IS IT A PAIN!!! While edges may peel away and trap dirt and look lousy, large, adhered surfaces really stick!Based on my experience with this unit, I will probably NOT buy another Invisible Shield for future MacBook Pros, and will think hard about buying them for other devices. It's nice to keep gear looking great for a long time, but my experience with this product is really really discouraging.ZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Apple MacBook Pro 15 -Inch 3rd Gen Unibody 2009 model (Full Body)

I selected this case because the Kindle always ends up in various precarious positions around my 2.5 year old and my 16 month old and I needed something that would still capture the Kindle's functionality while ensuring its safety.The case went on in minutes, it fully covers the Kindle, and it's pretty solid so it doesn't pull away from the edge.I noticed that several people have indicated that they had issues with overheating.  We have been using this case for about a month and haven't noticed any such issues (even though it usually sits adjacent to the stove in an under cabinet mount).Pros:Looks greatWorks wellIncludes a screen cover (replaceable)Corners are thicker so it can take a hitAllows you to retain full functionality of the KindleCons:If you have an existing screen cover then you need to remove it in order to use the one that comes with the Gumdrop case.

$REVIEW.: I bought these just to use as rear and side speakers in a 7.1 system

 I also tried a pair of them as front speakers, but that will not be a permanent position

They produce reasonably good sound


I do wish they were a little taller so that they would be more at ear level when seated


 My plan is to purchase a pair of Klipsch RF-62 speakers and a RC-62 center channel speaker to complete the system
It is interesting to note the speaker frequency specification of these speakers is about the same as the $500 RC-62 center channel speaker
The overwhelming majority of sound in a movie comes out of the center channel and next from the front side speakers


Well, the subwoofer produces all the low frequency sound

I plan to get the RW-12d for the subwoofer

So if a person really believes the published frequency range specifications, he would use these RF-10 speakers for everything except for the center channel and subwoofer
I bought four of these speakers on a previous Amazon sale thinking I got a really good deal, but now the price is even $19 per speaker less than what I paid
So I think $140 per speaker is a steal


I am really tempted to purchase another pair for the front left and right speakers and depend upon the subwoofer to handle everything under 60 Hz.Update: Klipsch now lists this speaker as a discontinued item
 I still believe these are best suited for side and rear speakers

Currently, I am inclined to consider the WF-35 or WF-34 line of Klipsch speakers for the front speakers and subwoofer.

$review_text.: I am a professional photographer. I purchased this camera for my mother thinking she would enjoy the extra features that it came with. I wish I had known ahead of time that this camera simply does NOT do what it says it does. I give this item two stars for quick shipping and price. When I get my money back I'll let you know.I spent three hours playing with this camera and getting to know its features only to find that it has very limited and pathetic features. The quality of the photos doesn't go up when altered. Literally, each setting produced the same quality photo; all of them very low. There was so much noise (and remember, I do this for a living with multiple professional DSLRs. I'm not just blowing smoke here.) that the photo was impossible to use. It's shutter speed alterations did not correctly change shutter speed (At 125 shutter speed I was getting incredibly dark photos with f/3.6 and a 1600 ISO. Ridiculous.) The lens had severe light aberrations in normal sunlight, and while I'm on the topic, the lens zoom didn't adhere to the chosen frame setting. (At a selected 16:9, zooming cropped the screen quality. Why in God's name would it do that!?) The manual ability would have been great if it...well it just wasn't great. 14MP is hardly high quality when it's 14MP of low quality, poorly lit, blurred photos. I am returning this product immediately.At the end of it all I can really only remind you that you're getting what you pay for. Cameras cannot be bought for less than $300 and expected to be up to par with your professional grade DLSRs. My advice, do NOT buy this camera. Look instead to the Canon SX40 HS. It costs over twice as much, but remember, the more you pay the better product you're getting. (Don't quote me on that.)

$REVIEW.: I purchase this camcorder from Amazon.com last year. It has a lot more features that I will every use in my life time. The video from this video camera is nothing but outstanding. The colors are just out of this world. The camcorder is so tiny that it fits just right in the palm of my hand. I am using a 16G SDHC Class 6 memory card with this camera. Also using Sothink Movie DVD Maker Pro (29.95 USD) to create great looking video that I play in my Blu-ray player and it also can be play in my SD video player. The video looks outstanding on a Samsung 55" LCD HDTV television. I needed to turn the Canon HF 20 camera's volume down a little because it would pickup some wind noise. I do not miss a viewfinder on a camcorder. I use the LCD on the camcorder to view what I am recording and for me it works just fine. This camcorder is going to last me a very long time, it has features that would last a life time. I like the idea of using SDHC memory cards, very nice. I purchase a BP-809 battery from a third party for very little cost. It is the size of the Canon BP-809 battery but when using the third party battery, the camcorder does not show the remaining time on the LCD display. And the third party battery has to be recharge using the Canon's AC power adapter. The third party battery seems to last as long as the Canon's BP-809 battery. There are a lot of Video Converter software that can convert AVCHD (mts, m2ts) format to any other video format that can be play on almost any type of video player. I burn my videos onto a DVD to be play on my Samsung 55" LCD HDTV. No problems. I would recommend the Canon's HF 20 camcorder to my friends.

$REVIEW.: The cap does not come with the string attached, it comes in a little baggie. The hole for the string is just small enough to make you think it's possible to poke it through, but after about 20 minutes of frustration and the string fraying on both ends, you realize it's a mind trick.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this for a few days now, and I'm very impressed. The package includes 3 protectors, which is helpful, both in case one gets scratched up and also in case you have issues putting one or two on (although you likely won't). It also includes a cleaning cloth and dust removal stickers. The stickers were one of my favorite parts, because getting those last few specks off is often an issue.After cleaning the screen thoroughly, adding the protector was easy. One recommendation to iSmooth: it would be nice if the top &#34;throwaway&#34; layer of the protector (you peel it off last) was marginally larger and the exact size of the Nexus 5 display so that it would be easier to align the protector properly. The protector is very slightly smaller than the screen - which is good, because otherwise it would be extremely easy to accidentally pry it up - and so until you've put the protector on, you're not quite sure exactly how to place it. The holes around the camera, top earpiece, etc. are large enough that you can't just rely upon looking at them. Anyway, barring that change, bear in mind that the protector will have a very thin (1mm or less) margin around it, so plan accordingly. My suggestion? Just lay it on the display with both of the peel-off layers on it before beginning any cleaning, just to get a feel for the margins.Bubbles smoothed out well. Simply ensure you've removed all dust (and oil), and the protector will lay down perfectly.Screen feel isn't quite as frictionless as the Gorilla Glass 3, but it's quite good. I'm very happy with this purchase. You will be too, as long as you clean the screen well first and take some care aligning the protector.

$REVIEW.: I had initially purchased one of these a month ago for my cousin and she has loved it.  I ended up needing a laptop for myself for a summer job assignment.  I initially wanted a MacBook Air but the 2GB RAM and measly 5 hour battery life turned me off.  I think the Air is still at least two iterations away from being something i'd consider.I then looked at the 15" and nearly purchased one before I decided to go back to my dorm and sleep on it.  Fortunately, my roommate had a 15" MBP and let me try to fit it in my computer bag as well as walking it around.  One, the 15" didn't fit in my bag lengthwise and two, it was simply too heavy.  Since I'd be walking a lot with my MBP each day, I wanted something as light as possible.  Then, I came back to this 13" model and bought it for 1099 and couldn't be happier.  The $600 I saved can go towards buying the 24" LED Cinema Display, which can satisfy my big screen needs, yet still retaining the portability I need.I also briefly considered the MacBook at 949 but figured for the $150 difference, I'd get twice as much RAM, firewire 800 (of which I do have a HDD with FW and USB, so essentially giving me an extra usb port to work with), aluminum unibody, 2 fewer ounces, backlit keyboard, sd card reader, and getting a "classier" computer, it was a no brainer to go with the 13" MBP.

$review_text.: Im giving this only a 3 star because i found certain thing i didnt like about this product


First and foremost, the earbud is made of cheap material and attracts dust very easily
Second is the cable length is either too short or too long -- there is no 'appropriate' length for the cable


For instance I'm 6&#34; and I couldnt put my phone in the pocket while standing


Even though there is an extension cable it will make it longer than needed
The sound quality is an A-OK
People who choose bass as their first priority will love these i assume


The mids and highs are not what i expected it to be


The one thing to admire about these headphones are the shape of the earbuds, which fit perfectly for the ear

It is comfortable and and sometimes you cant even feel your wearing a headphone! However given my rating, I still feel this is a good bang for the buck


Go for it if all you care about is a comfortable earphones with good bass.

Based on the recommendations of others, I paid the higher price for the Canon adapter rather than buying the third-party brand
The tripod mount on the bottom of the adapter is very useful in balancing the camera and the lens and is perfect for use with the Opteka HG-1 Heavy Duty Aluminum Grip which gives you solid, stable control of the camera and lens
I am very happy with this purchase and encourage Amazon and Canon to bring us the new Canon EOS-M2 so I can buy another camera and Canon mount adapter.

$review_text.: I had owned about 4 cheap USB card readers prior to purchasing this little guy here. All of them eventually perished after limited amounts of use. The metal prongs inside the things would always end up bending due to the way that the CF cards would loosely slide into the units.That certainly isnt an issue with this sandisk reader. The slot is cut to the exact size of the CF card and after about 2 years of use it still works as if I just got it in the mail from Amazon.Another perk is the fact that its firewire and that means its fast. Much faster than my old USB style readers and faster than my cameras as well....If you are in the market for a great CF card reader, you cant go wrong with this one here....

$REVIEW.: There are several features about this unit that are very good but just as many or more that are not so good. It is very accurate and it holds the satellite signal extremely well. The color display is very good although difficult to see well in bright sunlight. The unit is very "power hungry" and this is probably why the brightness is limited. It is also why the unit is designed to power up with the display very dim. It is brighter when used in the vehicle if plugged into the power outlet using the optional adapter.I use the unit primarily for hiking and geocaching and I really like the geocaching features especially the ability to go "paperless". I do not like the method of entering notes or coordinates into the unit. Instead of the displayed letter, number and character wheel, a virtual "keyboard" display would be much easier to use even with the same controls. A system similar to the Delorme PN-20 would be much better. Geocache files are handled differently than waypoints. One cannot delete geocache information from the unit but must connect to the computer to manage geocache files. Waypoints can be deleted individually directly from the unit without the computer.A word of caution: the base map files and preloaded Topo files are all combined into one large file which is NOT isolated or protected and can be deleted accidentally very easily. Be very careful!Road routing is excellent with the optional City Navigator software.One does not have an option for sorting geocaches or waypoints; default is by distance. If one knows the name or GC code, a search can be done fairly easily. It would be nice to have the option to sort either alphabetically or by distance.Although the Garmin Colorado is quite functional, it is far from the unit I expected. If I could return it now, I would do so. Then I would buy the Delorme PN-40 which will be available later this month.

$review_text.: I've tried two of these units in a row, and they both failed within a couple of days


 The failure process was the same as others have seen:  The unit works fine at first, for about a day, then starts beeping


 Other than the beeping, there's no immediate indication of a problem, even if you cycle through the displays on the unit


 If you keep an eye on the unit over the next day or so, you'll notice that the battery meter gets lower and lower, despite the fact that the household power is on (as evidence of that, the non-battery backup outlets of the unit continue to supply power)


 Once the battery meter gets to zero, the battery backup outlets no longer function, and the unit reports the F5 and F6 failures.Note that the non-battery backup outlets continue to function, providing you with a very expensive surge suppressor, and that's what I'm using until Amazon delivers my newly ordered Cyberpower unit.I'm fairly sure the two APC units I tried were from different batches, as one had a manual that was in English only, and the other had a manual with multiple languages


 I don't know if APC has just designed a bad unit, or has started using cheap parts that fail under load, though I suspect the latter


 It's a shame, as I have an older 1500VA APC unit that I've had for more than five years, which is still going strong on its original battery.

I did this because each Klipsch satellite has separate horn tweeter and midrange speaker. The mix-match system now sounds almost perfect to me. I got the Z-5500 to have the digital inputs for my PS3 and HDTV receiver and a remote control for convenience.

$REVIEW.: I'm a musician by background, and a music snob/audiophile by choice. As such, I have very high standards for headphones, and I didn't expect a whole lot from these. I was actually pleasantly surprised by them. They aren't phenomenal by any stretch, but they're better than most other headphones I've tried at this price level, making them an excellent value. Let me rate each aspect of them:Treble: 9/10 - Crisp, clear highs. Music is detailed and punchy.Mids: 8/10 - Good balance in the mid-range, but not too mid-rangy.Bass: 5/10 - Not a strong suit for sure, but few headphones in this price range (and physical size) have decent bass. Easily better than most, but not great.Coloration: 7/10 - I have not done true testing on these, but based on my non-technical observations, one of the most surprising aspects of these headphones is the lack of tonal coloration. Most headphones (especially in this price range) have significant coloration of the tone across the frequency spectrum. These have some (to the high-mid and low-treble side of things), but not nearly as much as I expected.Noise Isolation: 8/10 - Creates a good seal in the ear canal, blocking out ambient noise pretty well. Better than anticipated at this price range.Comfort: ??? - Not sure how comfortable these will be as I haven't had occasion to wear them for longer periods of time. However, I will say this: I typically HATE earbuds. I think they are one of the worst types of headphones. They are totally uncomfortable, they get tangled too easily, break too easily, and just don't have the size to reproduce decent sound. Mostly I hate them because they rarely fit well. I either have to twist, turn, or shove them into my ears, and even then they rarely stay put. I often find the earbuds falling out after a short period of use. I guess I just don't have the size/shape of ear canals that are conducive to this type of design. Accordingly, I have a hard time finding earbuds that seem to fit well. With that in mind, I was VERY pleasantly surprised that these earbuds fit immediately out of the box, with very little adjusting, pushing, or rearranging needed. They went in quickly...and not uncomfortably...and they stayed put - a significant enough feat on its own. And once I started listening to music with them, I forgot they were there - which is a stunning achievement. Typically with earbuds I'm ACUTELY aware at all times that I'm wearing earbuds. With these, they were such a good fit that they kind of got themselves out of the way. This alone is worth the price of admission for these headphones. Note that your mileage may vary depending on the size/shape of your ear canal, since everyone is different, though I was pleased to see that the box included two additional set of the rubber earbud mounts - one size smaller than the standard, and one size larger...a very helpful addition."Accessories": 6/10 - The big plus here are the additional earbud pieces, as noted above. The two major omissions are not specific to these headphones, but are annoying nonetheless. The first is the lack of in-line volume control. As far as I'm concerned, every single pair of headphones over $10 should include these. They don't cost that much more to implement, but are infinitely useful. For those who don't need/want them, they don't have to use them. But for those who DO use them, they are invaluable, and their omission here is worth noting. The second is the absence of any kind of carrying case. ESPECIALLY with these thin-wire-type earbuds, they get tangled easily, and even moreso when you have to shove them in a bag or a pocket without any kind of case. This should also be standard for all but the cheapest headphones. Again, these aren't specific to just these headphones, but still worth noting for sure.Overall, I'm very pleasantly surprised by these headphones. Their sound is crisp and clean, with a slight upper-midrange coloration. They lack bass, but still have more than many in this price range. While long-term comfort remains to be seen, they fit (my ears, at least) right out of the box, and stayed put. These headphones are good overall, but are an excellent value. So if the highest fidelity isn't the most important thing for you, and you can do without a couple of accessories (albeit crucial ones), these offer excellent bang for your buck. Recommended.

$review_text.: The case is sleek and well designed and is overall a well made product

The kindle fits in nicely and easily
The buttons and port access is nice

However it was a bit expensive in my opinion
Also I am kind of annoyed it was just release in the purple color which I preferred and was available in the smaller size
A note about delayed release would have been nice, i would have waited
Especially since a delivery issue resulted in receiving my actual device a week late


Not the fault of the product but I thought it was worth noting
The amazon branded cases are always nice and preferable to me

I may go back and order one for my kindle keyboard if they worked out the random electrical problem from when they came out a couple of years back

$review_text.: These walkie talkies do everything I need. Bought them for the kids who were always disappointed by the garbage toy ones sold in stores. Those were unable to transmit clear sound from any distance. For a few bucks more, I got these which work amazingly well. No interference. Clear transmission. Easy to use. I've only tested these as far as 1/4 mile away because that's why we bought them. But there was no issue at all and I could see them going much further. Only problem was the AAA batteries going dead after what seemed like a few hours of constant use. But I guess that's to be expected from 3 AAA batteries. I would rather put in 3 more or buy rechargeables than have some more expensive battery type. I would highly reccomend these as they work very well and are so inexpensive.

$REVIEW.: I bought a pair for around $18 at wal-mart, so even less is even a better deal. When I bought these, the package said studio headphones, or something like that. If you need headphones to do some mixing, I think you need to keep looking. I hear a smack around 1.6 K. It's fine if you just need them for listening to some music. Good for the price though.

Initially I had purchased an h55 for my dedicated computer and H60 for gaming rig, they performed so different that I ended up returning the H55 for another H60, also this was a deal breaker specially if you are a person who is always changing computer parts, the H55 unit on &#34;AMD&#34; platform the motherboard needs to be completely removed from the chassis case in order to be mounted, which it is very inconvenient if you ask me, the design on the H60 so MUCH BETTER!

$review_text.: I'm a photojournalist and sometimes need to transfer several GB of photos to clients in the field

I bought several of the Kingston DataTraveler Generation 3 Flash Drives

"Flash"--what a joke.I tested one yesterday


In a USB 2.0 computer slot (not a hub), it took 21 minutes to transfer 2.43 GB
That means it takes 35 freaking minutes to copy 4 GB onto this dumb thing! These stupid flash drives are totally useless for any sort of serious data transfer.One star

They work, and they fit the USB slot, that's about all
But the speed is simply wretched

This is many times SLOWER than a DVD burner! Too bad this review will be buried among the positive reviews.Two megabytes per second sounds fast
It is not

$review_text.: The hood blocks out surrounding light allowing easy viewing even in bright sunlight.  It does have a few drawbacks, but for when you know you'll be in bright sunlight, this definitely works to allow you to frame your subject and combined with the camera's peaking function, you can verify focus pretty well.  Unlike some of the other reviews, I like how the magnets break-away easily -- better that it drop off than put unnecessary force on the camera in the event of a hard knock or fall.This are the main negatives as I see it:- It doesn't collapse/fold, so it's a bit bulky (considering the small size of the camera).  It's another thing to carry around.- The lens isn't great quality, with lots of CA, so when I reviewed photos to see if they came out OK, it was sometimes hard to tell.- It uses magnets.  Another reviewer says that it damaged one of his lenses.  You probably need to store and handle this seprately from any lenses or anything that can be affected by magnets.It's a great value for the price, and it is very useful for certain situations.  It was very helpful in the outdoor event that I used it in.Great value!  Recommended, as long as you can work around its quirks.

$review_text.: I see that several other reviewers seem to think this item is "junk"

 My thought is that this device has a build quality that is "as good", if not BETTER, than similarly priced competing products
 It works..
fast and FLAWLESSLY


 Given the ZERO shipping cost with Prime membership, I would honestly buy another one (if I lost this one).PROS:* No cap to lose!* The reader has retractable doors on each end that slide-out to protect the male USB jack or any inserted memory cards
 (Did I mention "no cap to lose"?)* BONUS - It includes a short USB extension cable for hard to reach USB slots


 (The cable is not depicted in the photo or mentioned in the description, but it was included when I selected Amazon as the seller).* It mounts as TWO drives
 You can insert an SDHC card AND a MicroSDHC card SIMULTANEOUSLY, and both cards are accessible.CONS:* Although it LOOKS like brushed aluminum, it's plastic (like most other portable readers in this price range).* Slightly "bulkier" than some other options
(If you don't mind losing caps, or you can accomodate readers with "side" insertion slots, there are "slimmer/trimmer" options).

$review_text.: Haven't had an external flash since the days of dedicated thyristor vivitar on my OM-1 (miss those days...). I needed a flash for a wedding overseas to use with my Canon 60D. I looked online extensively, not wanting to spend much over $100, yet not wanting to have to buy a better flash in a few months. If you're looking at this then you know the 565EX is a twin to a much more expensive Canon flash. I definitely wanted ETTL since the flash would be camera mounted on my overseas trip. And it needed enough power to be able to bounce light off walls or ceiling. I was a bit hesitant since I read mixed reviews about the flash suddenly stopping, or overheating during a shoot. But I had no problems with it. Flash arrived packaged well, in a branded box tucked inside its sturdy cloth pouch. I examined it and was pleasantly surprised by the build quality, and a bit overwhelmed by the buttons and display. Also, once I put the batteries in (rechargeable AA's) I was not looking forward to hefting the weight of it around on a full day shoot. But I'm used to it since I use my LED light on my camera for video shoots.Ok, so then I checked the sparsely written and somewhat comical translation of the manual and understood the functions a bit better. Then I did an extensive test with the 60D, using it in various bounce settings in low light to simulate wedding conditions. Wow! I thought 'how can I miss!" The ETTL worked perfectly. During my test I tried different types of batteries, and of course the Eneloops were the way to go if I didn't want to wait to take another shot. And indeed, in a wedding scenario if you want to snap a few pics in succession I recommend the eneloops. Or a battery pack for the flash which I don't have. I took around 600 pics during the wedding and have only a couple rejects due to insufficient flash. I'm quite pleased with the on-camera performance of the 565EX, and look forward to try it wireless off-cam coupled with the master flash on the 60D. The obvious cons to the flash are the manual and lack of high speed shutter. It's also slave-only and the audible beeps are astonishingly noisy (you turn it off deep in a function menu). If you need the ETTL with occasion to use it as a strobist flash get this one. It also works with Nikon (same unit right out of the box will work with either camera). If ETTL is no concern then get the 468ll or the 560lll. The 565EX is more powerful, has zoom range to 105mm and works wirelessly with ETTL. Unfortunately I didn't buy this when I got my 60D a couple years ago when the price was around $100. I paid close to $160.

$REVIEW.: I'm now revising my review after owning this for about a month.  I still think that the rave reviews are confusing.  The upresing performance of this thing is actually astounding.  If you never buy a blu-ray disc, you'll be perfectly happy with the picture, even on a large plasma/lcd.The bad news is that all of the nice logical user interface things you'd expect from Samsung (and that I did expect after previously owning a Samsung DVD player) are jacked or gone.For instance, I just opened the tray, set a disc in, and then had to hit both 'eject' and 'play' on it several times before it would freaking take the disc.It really comes down to a lot of little things, but they add up eventually and have you pulling out your hair.  More things, just off the top of my head:- I just tried to update the firmware, in hopes that they would have actually fixed some of this stuff.  I went to the menu and told it to update, and it said I had to eject my current disc before it would consider updating.- My old Samsung DVD player (DVD-HD860) would remember where you were on a disc when you turned it off (or ejected).  When you booted back up to that disc, you'd be right back where you left off.  This thing only does that once in a blue moon, and I'm not sure how to get it to always do it.- The Netflix feature doesn't allow you to choose a stream quality, which means that if you are on non-blazing internet, you're stuck with a picture that actually looks worse than if I just watch on my laptop.- The remote control has 3 different menu buttons.  Three.  Apparently they all do different things, but not necessarily as labeled.  Poor layout, and you're very often locked out of performing functions you want to (a la classic DVD previews you MUST watch according to the disc author).  But worse.- Firmware update via ethernet is pretty buggy.  The screen went blank for ten minutes without telling me anything.  I had no idea what to do, did it crash?  Will I break it if I reboot?  Etc.This thing just feels very rushed, and the pricetag isn't appropriate for something that doesn't run smoothly and without frustrating.

$review_text.: This speaker is compact, comes with a cute little carrying case and, for the few minutes it worked, apparently produces a more-than-adequate sound.  However, pairing it with my ipad 2 was difficult.  I had to go to the web and explore possibilities -- and then do a factory re-set on the speaker several times to get it to pair.  Once it paired, the sound was fine . . . and we got excited.  However, it cut out after anywhere between two and five minutes, requiring me to go through the whole factory re-set/re-pairing again.  And then it cut out . . . well, you get the picture.  According to one of Logitech's chat lines, they "are aware of the problem and are working on it."  (This was mid-summer.)  I'm sorry, this isn't good enough -- the speaker is in a box and will be returned.  A disappointment, particularly as I was counting on it for a professional engagement next weekend.

$REVIEW.: So I'm currently using this at work to add a 3rd monitor as an extended desktop to my other two.  I have to say with Windows XP at least the set up is really quite nice and easy.  Lots of options for cloning or extending and a great deal of control over which monitor is which.One interesting thing that is worth mentioning is that you can have up to 6 of these.  That means 6 additional monitors can conceivably be added to your current set up should you ever have a desire for such a thing (although I personally would hate it as I'd never be able to find my cursor).  Now you can only do one monitor per device you buy.  If you DO want to do 6, you'll have to buy 6 of these.It also  allows you to add a VGA port to a device that doesn't have one.  Why do I care about this?  Well...it sure would be nice to play video files on my Dell Duo (tablet/netbook) on my HDTV.  Since it has no HDMI, VGA, or DVI port natively, this would allow that.  I'm sure you can think of other devices with this same issue...An additional point of interest for some - normally when you clone monitors in Windows you have to set both monitors at the same resolution.  Further it means you have to go with the resolution of the worst monitor as a max and that mixing monitors of differing aspect ratios will yield weird results.  (for instance, if you have a monitor that's capable of 1920x1200 and one that can only do 1280 x 1024, you'll have to run both at 1280x1024 or less).  This device allows you to clone monitors...at different resolutions!  If you don't need this...you don't care.  But if you do, you KNOW what a huge deal this is!The only complaint I have with the way I'm currently using it is that whenever my computer goes to sleep, whatever is on the 3rd monitor (the one on this device) gets pushed over to one of the other screens.  Very minor, but I have so many applications open at once that it'd be nice if they stayed put over there.However, that said here are some other things worth knowing (for most people these wouldn't be issues I don't think, but just in case it doesn't happen to impact you...)I originally got it for an embedded project since it would have been a lot nicer to have a USB port than a VGA port + power.  It was a nice small form factor for it, but ultimately I didn't end up using it because:1. It requires a driver to install.  This means that every computer you plug it into will need to install this software.  That's fine if you have a specific computer you're going to use it on.  Not so much for an embedded device that needs to plug into a variety of computers.2. I don't know if it's a problem with Windows 7 or with the specific computer I was using it with, but the "primary" computer for the embedded device didn't do so well with the USB display device software.  The resolution stayed set from the last computer I used it on and as for cloning and extending the video card of the computer recognized it as a 3rd monitor.  It did mean I could technically use it, but I didn't have all options available and I wasn't able to get the exact set up I wanted because I couldn't access the software.  On the XP computers I didn't have this issue.  You may find you also only have access to some options if whatever impacted me shows up for you.  (It really may be the Win 7 thing)3. It's a teeny bit of a power hog.  I had a USB hub internal to my device.  I should have had about 200 mA available for this, but it exceeded it a few times which wasn't a big deal but I got flicker because of that.  Unless you are also using it on an unpowered hub with other devices though, you'll never notice this.All in all, I actually really like it and think it works pretty well indeed.  It didn't work for what I bought it for, but that doesn't mean I don't find it useful.Update: co-worker of mine got one and says it worked fine for him on Windows 7 computer - either they updated the software in the meantime (it's over a year later at this point) or it was just the computer I was using.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Moshi palm guard because of their reputation - and they deserve it. It was easy to install, taking only a few minutes. It looks and feels durable. I feel much safer using my brand new MBP with this installed - especially for those occasions when I'm wearing a watch. It does not show dirt, or scratches. The included trackpad protector actually makes the trackpad easier to use in my opinion because of the added texture. I've recommended this to a few of my friends, and intend to purchase one of these for every Macbook that I purchase in the future.

$review_text.: These speakers are just OK.  I figured out that they work in conjunction with the speakers built into my Chromebook, and not independently, as I had expected.I started to return them, but remembered that in searching for PC speakers, some of them advertised compatibility with other operating systems other than Chromebook OS (i.e. Mac, Windows).  Therefore, in light of this, I decided to keep them since they were advertised to work with Chromebook..My observation of these speakers is that the only thing they do OK is to add some bass to make the sound you hear a &#8220;little&#8221; better than just using the laptop speakers only (which aren&#8217;t bad at all on my Chromebook).  On the flip side, the speakers give slightly greater volume when hooked up to my MP3 player.  Also, I like the design.The lights are a good feature and I like them.  They come on when I start my laptop and turn off when I turn my laptop off.These speakers will do until I can find more powerful speakers that are compatible with my Chromebook OS.

$review_text.: This is one of the few DVR boxes in this price class that has an analog tuner for reception of older-style NTSC analog broadcasts
 (NTSC is what old &#34;square&#34; TV sets receive.)  I got this one because when I travel I stay in guest houses and hotel rooms with the local TV stations in HD, and the &#34;cable&#34; channels still in analog

 This is because these businesses don't get their programming from the local cable company

 They use a rooftop antenna to receive local TV stations, and commercial grade &#34;chassis and card&#34; style DirecTV receiver units that provide 6 or more analog channels, and can't afford the cost of replacing them with new digital models


 Many of these places have just invested in upgrading their TV sets to HD models


 (As recently as a year ago, they still had old-fashioned TV sets!)  That in a nutshell is why you should care if your DVR has an analog tuner if you travel with one of these.Now about the unit

 I'm a TiVo owner, so I have certain standards
 This box ain't no TiVo!!!  But it is a capable box that can do one thing that no TiVo can do
 This box gets its program guide data directly from local TV stations, and allows you to recodr by program name instead of time and channel

 (There's no data for analog channels, so you have to record these like with an olf VCR.)  Setup is relatively painless, with a scan for analog and digital TV channels that finishes relatively quickly

 Once set up, channels can be selected as you would with your TV set, using (for example) &#34;5-1&#34; to get the main program stream from digital TV channel 5, and &#34;23&#34; to select analog channel 23

 There's only one tuner input (the other is an output), so you can connect to an antenna (ATSC/NTSC) or closed circuit (MATV, CATV, etc.) cable (OpenQAM, NTSC), but not both at once.One big disappointment with this box is that it does not support pausing or rewinding live programming

 If you must have this feature, this isn't the box for you

 OTOH you can play back a program that you're recording, so that's one work-around
 Since you have to go to the playlist it's not as convenient, but it's better than nothing

 I typically use this to record the news and other shows that I'm going to miss because I'm out doing things, so I can watch them before I go to bed

 I realize that most road warriors aren't going to pack a DVR, so this is more likely to be used in a vacation house or other place where you wouldn't want to pay for cable TV service year 'round
 You could use this as a budget &#34;only DVR&#34;, but it's not really for cable systems


 Whatever you use it for, it's going to be a special purpose.Now for what this box can do:  It can record one channel while you watch another channel
 It can record by time/channel (what I call &#34;VCR mode&#34;), or by program name when the digital TV station provides program guide data


 It can record one show while playing back another


 And, as I noted before, it can play back the program you're recording

 It sets its clock from a local TV station


 It shuts itself off when it's done recording to save power


 It plays MPEG-2 (PS) video from an external drive (a USB thumb drive or USB-connected hard drive) and saves MPEG-2 (TS) video to a connected drive


 It can be set up to play to a HDTV or an old NTSC TV/monitor
 There's a separate RCA jack to feed an RF modulator (not included) if your TV doesn't have line inputs.Picture quality is great


 The remote is awful


 You have to point it straight at the box, and even then it doesn't get the message on the first try

 It has HDMI outputs, but, as usual the cable is not included

 The manual is very basic

 If you need an analog (NTSC) / digital (ATSC or QAM) DVR with a built-in HDD at around $200, this is likely to be your only choice.

I bought this as a primary drive replacement while the 1.5 was in for exchange. Used the Acronis software provided by Western Digital (support-download section)to clone and copy to the new drive (flawless transfer). I guess it depends when your new WD 2TB was made, but mine came with a 64mb cache. All-in-all, I love it. Quiet. plenty fast, lots of room. Very well packed from WD. And a Plus--delivered by UPS free.My 1.5 came back from Gateway, which I now use as a second logical drive for data(photos, doc's, music etc...)Resulting in 3.5 TB total storage. So..I ordered a WD 2TB My Book (due in 2 days) to run automatic backups on. Set for life? Probably.

$REVIEW.: This is my first Lenovo notebook and I am very impressed. It's hard to believe how much is included with the e520, despite it being part of the Lenovo's budget lineup, the Thinkpad Edge series. Here's a list of what I found impressive:PROSGreat keyboard - both the overall design and the feel. (Note: I didn't like the nonstandard placement of the control key. I went into the BIOS to swap it with FN key to get the normal position - now I'm happy).Very quiet (with exception of DVD drive - see below)7200 RPM 500GB hard drive seems plenty quiet and fasti5 2410m processor gives you turbo mode when needed (over less expensive systems that have the i3 2310m). I've noticed it kick in for sluggish web sites like bgr.com (can hear the fan get louder when this happens).Boot time 25 seconds to user screen, then 8 seconds after clicking on user. My boot time is now 30+10=40 total seconds after adding my own software. Resume from standby: less than 2 seconds.includes fingerprint reader, bluetooth, webcamThe overall hardware build quality very good considering the priceThe software build quality is terrific. Many system builders layer on so much junk onto Windows that it starts out of the box slow and buggy - not so with this unit. Includes Symantec's Norton Internet Security which I was using anyway (and have liked since version 10.0), and the Windows office starter, and a useful suite of Lenovo utilities. That's it.*****************************That being, said, this IS part of the budget lineup. Here's what I noticed was given up in this model in order to hit this price point:CONSNo keyboard Thinklight or key back lighting of any kind. The black keyboard can't be seen in dim light so you'll need an external light source at night. Most of the more expensive Lenovo's have this desirable feature.The screen is usable and without defects but is mediocre. I'm used to high quality screens for my desktop units and this is not even close, with poor viewing angles, less sharp text, muted colors, etc. It doesn't matter for me because I use it 98% of the time hooked up to a high quality 24" monitor/TV.The DVD drive is a cheap unit that is obnoxiously loud. Thankfully, I greatly reduced the noise from this by going into the BIOS and choosing the "silent" option for the DVD drive which is a tradeoff - I sacrifice speed in order to get quiet. This is well worth it for me as I'll be using it primarily to play movies, which don't require a rapidly spinning drive.Default touchpad settings were not so great. Took quite a bit of fiddling with the touchpad settings to increase responsiveness and accuracy.WHY I BOUGHT THE e520We have a family room which doubles as my early AM/late PM home office, as well as a home entertainment center. So we've been using a slow, hot, noisy old Dell desktop to run Windows XP Media Center Edition. I've been waiting patiently for years to replace it with a much better HTPC with appropriate price/performance.The Mac Mini seems like the perfect form factor yet in the Windows world you have to spend at least $1000 to get similar quality. If you literally buy a current Mac Mini, you'd also have to buy a Windows license, an external DVD drive, and a TV tuner which works with Macs, which tend to be more expensive than Windows TV tuners. So the price goes almost up to $1000 that route as well.In doing my research for the HTPC, it become obvious that laptop components are better suited for HTPC use because they use less power and therefore run less hot and less noisy (less fan cooling required). However, until 2011, integrated graphics in notebooks were usually not adequate. Now there's Intel's Sandy Bridge mobile parts, namely the i5 2410m (or not quite as powerful i3 2310m) combined with Intel's integrated HD 3000 graphics. It is the HD 3000 which is the key - it is more than enough graphics power to easily handle any kind of HTPC use.So I started looking at inexpensive laptops and was pleasantly shocked at how much computer you can get for about six hundred dollars. I settled on the e520 for this purpose because it included a 7200 RPM 500GB hard drive which none of the notebooks with i5 2410m did at around the same price point. Dell was very close but with them you never know how much junk they put on your computer in the budget models which might hobble the system.WHY THIS UNIT WORKS SO WELL FOR MESo how is this working (after getting past the setup of figuring out how to make the DVD drive less noisy and getting the external monitor to be the main monitor)?Great! It's quiet and fast. It's relatively attractive. Windows 7 and Media center run fine (and note that the Integrated Intel HD 3000 graphic runs my external 1920 x 1200 monitor/TV fast and smoothly). I did need to get a powered USB hub to accommodate the numerous USB devices but that's a good idea anyway to keep the unit running cooler. In the event we want to view a movie or TV recording in another part of the house, I'll be able to just disconnect the laptop and carry it there.Given how great this budget Lenovo unit is, I can only imagine how great the more expensive units are. But for someone planning to use their laptop primarily in a stationary setup like mine where you have plenty of light and an external monitor - this unit is a terrific value.
