$REVIEW.: Ordered this from warehouse deals at Amazon, 1st time they sent an old Denon amp from a few years ago in the right box, this one was correct but have not been able to get it to work. This is a beautiful amp with lots of menus, connections, looks like the internet radio would be fantastic-if only I could hear something. We have tried playing from radio, cd's, radio, rewiring all of the speakers, trying just two of them, plugging in headphones-never a sound. All the menus work except for the audyssey-it just sits there with no sound. My setup worked fine with my old non-hdmi amp but we wanted hdmi for our new tv. Unfortunately it is going to have to go back-I hate it because we got it for under 500 which is a steal with all of its functions....except sound that is. For those of you who chance warehouse deals beware this one is going to be sent out again to the next sucker(fyi-last 4 digits on serial no are 4139).
$SUMMARY.: have not been able to get any sound out of it

$REVIEW.: What other reviewers say is generally true about this product. The headset is a bit heavy and clamps tightly but the pads provided do make it more comfortable. Ear sweat will develope unless you take 5 minutes off each hour. The sound volume issue mentioned in a few reviews seems to have been solved by the latest software.The sound quality is superb, in an FPS I tested this by closing my eyes and spinning my POV randomly a few seconds. I was un-erringly able to locate where a loudspeaker in the enviorment was located with a high degree of accuracy. You will feel the bass during explosions. I felt like the cockpit was shaking when an opponent did a highspeed flyby over my canopy. You are isolated from the ambient enviornment while playing, for me this is a plus, though it also results in the ear sweat. The mic is high quality and the 'up for mute' function is paticularly useful as some games I play have the mic open all the time so a quick swipe up prevents broadcasting a sneezing fit. The volume roller on the headset is a great plus as I always forget to adjust before starting an application.I withheld a star because of the software. The three "G" keys are limited to a controlling a few programs built into the sotfware. Two of the available programs happen to be the ones I want (iTunes, Ventrilo), but I've come to expect complete customisation of buttons on gaming devices. The voice morphing feature works well but is a bit silly, I'll never use it.Overall I'd reccommend this headset highly.

$REVIEW.: After a few weeks of researching a GPS unit for my wife, it was a toss-up between the Garmin 855 and the Magellan 4700. Voice Recognition (VR) was a must for my wife to use it. I wanted her hands on the wheel.The 4700 became our final choice based on screen size, intuitive ease of data entry, the addition of Bluetooth, and no cost traffic alerts (when we finally buy the FM receiver wire).I originally ordered from Amazon but their delivery outlook was not good, and I went with BB. It saved me $7 but cost me NJ tax. Net additional expense was $5.Since then:. Loaded the 2.06 Software update without incident in about 10 minutes. It was easy.. Satellite acquisition has been fast .... +/- 20 seconds.. Routing is reasonably quick. Alternate routes take a bit longer.. The map system found our Delaware home address (in a remote new community)that other GPS's have failed to locate.. We have not traveled extensively with it yet, but from what we see the 4700routing process sometimes uses less than optimal routing.. TTS voice prompts are somewhat garbled but definitely discernible.. The POI's are very extensive and pretty useful.. Speaker volume is excellent.. Voice recognition is usable but requires a bit of refinement. It sometimes takes a fewattempts to register voice commands. It does however aid in hands free driving.. Configured three family phones for Bluetooth very quickly. Phone reception on bothends is quite good.. One phone took three tries to connect to Bluetooth but finally did.. Imported all phone addresses without incident. Over 225 entries.. Calls from the address book could be initiated by the GPS easily.. We set all 9 Speed dial entries. All worked fine.. Address entry is easy, but we are experiencing the issue of voice acknowledgmentof letters that do not register on the screen during entry.. Note: Garmin 855 is hands down a better VR unit in this regard but lacks some of the4700 features and larger screen size.. I find the touch screen a bit unresponsive at times but other family members do not.We suspect the next Software update (2.20 ?) will refine this unit to the point where it will be a five star device. Contrary to other 4700 owners we found the unit quite stable & remarkably sophisticated for a unit that costs under $175. A few years ago this would have cost $1000.RECOMMENDED without hesitation.

$REVIEW.: This MoKo Slim-Fit  Folio Cover Case for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 arrived on time and fit my Note 10.1 tablet and seemed like it was well made


It also has the right cut outs and easy access to the pen

It can be used at different angles and also provides some protection if dropped and lands on a corner, or flat down with the screen side hitting the floor or whatever surface it lands on, thanks to the elastic band that securely holds the case together

(Don't forget to put this small but useful elastic band across the case when putting your tablet away, the Small lip over the front of the case doesn't stay secured
I had been very happy with it until it started to fall apart

It's still works as a cover but as a way to use it as a stand is non-existent


The material is now stretched and won't hold the tablet up at any angle, so I just fold the front cover back and use the strap to slide my hand through
It works, but gets tiring after a short time
 The reason I'm writing this review now is because within six months the case has now come to it's end as a case for protection or comfortable to use


So for short term use, I gave 3 stars, had it lasted for a year, I would rate it 5 stars
(I only use my tablet when traveling, so this case should have lasted at least a year with the limited use
All in all this was the only cover I found that had all the cut outs, and could be used even while charging


Just needs to last longer.


$SUMMARY.: Good cover while it lasted

$REVIEW.: Overall: the remote is good, but be aware - the listed range is excessively overstated for typical use...If you are familiar with Harmony remotes, setup is typical; otherwise, it is a bit tedious, but not overwhelming.  One issue is that Harmony cannot (or at least will not) port an existing remote configuration from a lower remote to the 900 - net, you'll have to rebuild your devices and activities from scratch!The remote works reliably and the blasters work as advertised with one glaring exception - the listed range of 100' is not supported in a typical house (has other wireless devices in the area).  Based on a lengthy call with Harmony Tech Support to resolve blaster issues, they recommend a range of only 20 - 25 feet if you have any other wireless devices in your house (wireless phone, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.).  This seems quite restrictive for such an expensive product.  If you only need a close in product - it works great.  If you need the range - be ready to return it...Personal experience is that at 35 feet, the RF becomes sketchy enough to seriously degrade the product's usefulness (to be clear, that's 35 feet in clear air as my blaster is in the open)...

The only thing missing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that there is no auto sleep/wake function. However, I knew this before ordering this particular case; I still wanted it simply because of it's eye appeal and book-like feel. It also offers your iPad a lot of protection if you happen to drop it.

$review_text.: This is a great product first of all. The reason I gave it four stars is because there is something better.  There is a product that does the same thing but has a battery in it.  This produce will do the job of mobile internet, but having to plug it in seems to defeat the purpose behind it.  The plus of the device is that it is small, looks good, and really works well.  But if I am taking it with me for remote internet access, I do not want to find a plug for it.  And the need for cables is too much.  Look for the battery operated product, it is just as good and more convenient.  But if this works for you, go for it, it works well and is well made.

$review_text.: Cute and functional case. The back is transparent and does a good job of protecting the iPad from any scratches. I have an iPad with retina display and it fits the iPad perfectly though the opening at the bottom is designed for the 10 pin dock. In regards to the cover, it performs the same function as the smart cover and will turn your iPad on and off when you open it or close it, and the folding function works quite nicely to keep your iPad upright. Overall, it's cheaper than the respective apple official products (both smart cover and protection for the back f the iPad) and does a very nice job of keeping the iPad safe and also working as a stand. It is minimally bulky (one of the reasons why I bought it) and is inconspicuous as well. Definitely worth the money. Would recommend

$review_text.: I have a 4-way KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch with PS2 ports, and needed a new mouse. I wanted a true PS2 mouse because I had read that USB mice with PS2 adapters sometimes do not work well. Another reason is the keyboard and mouse ports on my KVM switch are close together, too close for a USB A connector.I chose this one because of the Logitech brand vs unknown, the reviews, and because it is a true PS2 mouse. The mouse seems to be of decent quality. The buttons and wheel have a nice feel.This mouse does have one quirk though. My keyboard shelf has a wood grain veneer, which caused the mouse to freak out every few minutes (it would jump to the top left of the screen). I downloaded and installed the latest Logitech driver but that didn't help. I was beginning to think the mouse was defective. It seemed unlikely but I placed it on a mouse pad to see if that would help, and it is okay now. My mouse pad has a print design, and though the mouse has been working much better with it, it has freaked out on me a few times over the last week. My conclusion is this mouse needs a solid color surface to work correctly.

$REVIEW.: I picked up a monitor at a thrift store for $5 to use as an extra display for my webcams


 However, it had a VGA connection, while my computer's video card only has DVI output

 So this adapter did the trick, didn't cost me an arm and a leg, and I can monitor my webcams without taking up my regular computer screen


 Tightening the screws was a little, um, tight


 Someone with large fingers might have a little difficulty if the available space on either side of the adapter is small - I almost had to disconnect my other monitor so that I could tighten it on one side


 But it all worked out, and I'm happy!

$review_text.: This is a great deal for what you pay for if you have a UV-5r.  Almost 4 amps of lithium power that with no power save used on the rig still gets me a few days on a charge.  The pack feels very light, I have the feeling the entire thing is not really full of &#34;battery&#34; but so what, it works and it's plenty of power.I've been a ham radio op for almost 20 years now and I remember back in the 80's and 90's when everything was nicad or nickle metal packs, and unless the pack was huge and weighed a few pounds you did not get performance like this.  Lithium also has the advantage of very low drain over time, so you can charge a few of these up and leave them in your go kit or a drawer or whatever for whenever you need a pack to go.Only thing I think that could be improved on is a bit quicker charger for it, but I guess if they made one, people would try to quickly charge the smaller packs and ruin them.  This product is a great idea that is sorely not done on most of the modern rigs out these days.

$REVIEW.: I bought this remote to control my XBox 360, Denon AVR-3310ci and Panasonic TV.  The first and biggest advantage to this was the ease of setup.  It is incredibly easy to program this remote through your pc.  The interfacs shows a photo of the remote itself on one side, and all the commands for the device you are working with (for example my XBox 360, in the list was the 'x', 'y', 'Start', etc.).  It pre-programs the obvious keys (left, right, etc.) but you can change anything you want just by dragging and dropping the function onto the picture of the remote.  It is so intuitive- I was blown away.It worked with all my devices, but I have two negatives (one of which isn't really Logitech's fault).1) It doesn't work with my Next Generation remote extender.  This is a device that allows me to hide all my devices in a cabinet.  All my other remotes work fine with it, but not the Harmony 300 (I have the 300i, for whatever that's worth).  For me, this is a deal-killer as I hate leaving the cabinets open to expose the IR ports and I don't want to pay the extra $50 or whatever for a new IR extension system.  I'd rather just try a different Universal Remote in the $20-$30 range.2) No backlight.  I understand it's a 'value' remote, but I can't imagine it would've added that much to the cost to provide a backlight.  In my case not a deal killer, but if you watch movies or TV in a dark room you'll immediately wish they had added that to the device.All in all a great product.  To repeat- setup was amazingly simple and it worked flawlessly.  Other companies could learn a thing or two from Logitech's web user interface for this device.  I wish there was some way I could get my Next Generation extender to work with it, but I don't think it's in the cards and I'll be trying something else.

This projector is everything I had hoped for and more.  It is very bright (I do not dim the lights).  I use the projector at about a five foot distance from the wall.  The display is very bright and large.  At this point, I have nothing negative to say about this projector.  It is small enough to carry back and forth to class, yet heavy enough to not move around while I walk and talk with my iPad. Which brings me to the last point that it works seamlessly with the iPad/VGA adapter.  This can be picked up at the Apple store.I use Notability on my iPad 2 for displaying lectures as I write.  Also, the fan is not noisy in my opinion at all on this projector.The projector also works at home for displaying outdoor movies for fun.

If you change zoom or pan to something else, there is a second or two of blur before it can refocus.

$REVIEW.: I frequently purchase/install Netgear equipment for our growing business and I've always been satisfied with their products

The first one started malfunctioning within 3 months; thought nothing of it and purchased an identical replacement

This one started with the dropped connections and getting hot (It wasn't an issue with electrical or the environment)


2 in a row is never a good sign.The R6200 was easy to set up/configure - nothing out of the ordinary
If you've set one router up and with basic networking knowledge, you'll be fine with all of them.


$SUMMARY.: Love most Netgear products.

$REVIEW.: Bought this replacement battery on Amazon for aging HP Pavilion dv7 laptop, the original battery could barely go 30 min without dying. This replacement fits perfectly. Full charge lasts 2 hr with basic use (web surfing, documents, spreadsheets, etc), not bad for the cheap price of a replacement battery.
$SUMMARY.: Good battery replacement for HP Pavilion dv7 laptop

$review_text.: The job I worked at until recently this year had lots of problems with people returning media. I researched this and found that unless your drive is an enternal computer dvd burner, or you have a brand new top of the line TV set top DVD recorder you can't use 8x speed disks end of discussion. so if you are looking for blank disks for a DVD burner you have hooked up to your TV most likely you should not buy these. However These are the only disks I have been able to get to work with my enternal Sony 16x dvd/cd burner. That is if I want them to play in my panasonic surround sound.

Also, Both are thin AWG (like the 4 wire flat RGB extension wire). One reviewer said was 22AWG although I don't have a wire gauge to determine size.Since the resistors nearest the power supply were getting hot I will be using these on a 6m LED strip by supplying power and ground (from the same source) to both ends to balance/split the load.  Hopefully the thin AWG won't be an issue.

Bigger than I expected too


Using it with a Nikon D90 and D300 with a battery grip
It holds up fine for me even with my 80-200mm lens
The $45 price works for me too! I love the smooth action when panning too, which is great if you do video


I appreciate the big knobs, which are easy to tighten and loosen


Just know that the bottom of the ball head requires a 3/8&#34;
I also use this on my camera slider and I have a 3/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; adapter for it.

$review_text.: The best portable Hi-End portable headphones, use only 23 Ohm of resistance - my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3 drives those easy, no PowerAmp pre-amp boost is needed. I am comparing to 64 Ohm Sennheiser HD 280 Pro, where I have to boost PowerAmp pre-amp all the way to the top for headphone's soundstage to open up and expand, in other words, to achieve the full covered frequency range of headphones. Yamaha's 23 Ohm of resistance shows all the way - I keep the volume on my Samsung Galaxy S3 connected to Yamaha 500 PRO on the lowest volume level, next to silent - low impedance ensures full loud sound on the low volume level. While listening to Yamaha, PowerAmp pre-amp level is in the middle, bass boost off, treble boost off, equalizer off - the sound in Yams does not need no help. For my Sennheiser HD 280 Pro volume level is 5/8 up, and if I want loud bass, 3/4 up, with the pre-amp level all the way up and bass boost on. While breaking in the Yamahas, on 1/2 the volume I could hear headphones playing loud and clear from across the large living room, 12-15 feet away. 500 PRO are very loud (high sound output, powerful 50mm magnets) headphones.With rich bass, wide stereo field, Yamaha PRO 500 sound is fantastic, coming in your ears, appear in your head out of nowhere - you don't feel "pointed-in-your-eardrums" sound of music, it is rather that wave after wave envelopes your eardrums, making you stop and listen, kinda like then you were a child and you wanted to hear what is coming next in your mother's bedtime story. 500 PROs are that good. Nice array of accessories, nice hard luxury-feel-emitting quality hard carrying case, 2 detachable cables (one 4 meter long for receiver and one shorter with remote for portables. Cables are very high quality, thick, beefy, substantial and light at the same time, with nice silk-screened Yamaha logo, gold-coated jacks, flexible but both cables do not pass thump/sound of touch along to earcups - what I mean is if you touch or bump cables 3-4 inches away from headphone cups, you cannot hear the thump of the sound - cable isolation material is sound-deadening - unlike on many of mine IEMs, where sound of touch or bump will travel all the way to the ears from any distance of the cable being touched or bumped. You can also connect cable to both sides of headphones, and it is normal 3,5 mm cable, so will be easy to replace if needed. I am right handed, so I connect to left side, but if you are leftie, you can connect to the right cable ear-cup, You can also daisy-chain Yams with another pair of headphones, but I haven't tried it yet. Looks like you can change the headband cushion too - I can see 4 little metal screws on the sides of headband - headband is made of some gel-like silicone-filled balloon cushion, triangular in shape, with one of the angles pointing towards the head. My Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphone's headband is still ok looking after 7 years of constant use. Let's see how Yams will stand the test of time. Headband is durable-looking, like the whole rest of Yams, will probably last, since synthetic silicone is stronger material by itself comparing to leather.NO ANDROID powered remote. Yamaha, are you listening !!!???!!! I paid top buck for 500 PROs, I will pay top buck to get my Android-compatible remote, please make sure I can buy those separately once you produce this Android remote, and please make it happen soon, Thank You, Yamaha !!! :-)))On Android-powered SGS3 the remote's middle button works (play/pause/next track/previous track), volume buttons and mic do not work, if you receive incoming cell phone call, S3 switches the sound to the phone's speaker/mic, thus I do not hear the caller in the headphones and have to take them off. I always think of Thinksounds' Ts-02 mic/remote, where the genius inventor made them (button and Mic) work with Android-powered Samsung Galaxy S3 AND Apple iPhone 5 at the same time, what a genius that guy is ... Even Yamaha couldn't do it ... and Yamaha is the world biggest music equipment creator for pros ...The PRO 500 is an around-the-ear, circum-aural design, very comfortable to skin and ears, though you will feel some slight pressure on the top of your head, seem to only happen during long listening periods. Adjusting the band helps, ear pads are very comfy to ears and plush, so is the underside of headband, overall the around-ear design works just as good for comfort and the overall listening experience as Senns HD 280 PRO larger-more-around-the-ears design, sound isolation is also on par.The materials used and the surface finish on the PRO 500 are top-notch. Mine were chosen in racing blue, and the paint job is NICE - has two-tone, automobile quality clear-coat duo-tone finish, looks super to the eyes, and is durable - I already banged them on my head into the walls and corners (by accident, not intentionally :-)(headphones sit quite high and wide on the head, easy to hit objects with them), and I thought for sure I have made a dent or at least scratched the finish of Yams - but no, even the clear coat lacquer finish didn't show no blemishes after those hard, against the hard-objects knocks.The only con as I see it the Yams are a little heavy cos of high-quality materials used and for being foldable design. Foldable design means there are two metal hinges one inch away from ear cups, those metal hinges allow headphones to collapse into itself in order to make them truly portable and ready to fit into whatever bag you carry with you to go on the road. Nevertheless, in my very humble opinion, high quality dense plastic resin and metal of the frame and hinges material, and portability enhancing duo-fold are all the more important to me, comparing to just being "feather-weight". So no stars detracted.I got mine 500 PROs on the site for the new fresh egg dot com, I am a new egg and the Banker in the real life !!! The deal was too good to pass from financial standpoint, so after having carefully reviewed hours after hours of reviews on Momentums and PRO 500 on Amazon, CNET.US (for 500 PRO review) and CNET.UK (for Senns Momentums review), New fresh eggs and PCMag (Thanks for the excellent review, Mr. Gideon), I bitten the bullet and got 500 PRO. I have 500s' for over a month now, use them daily. Very happy experience. Thank You, Yamaha team, you made my life more bearable with better and nicer sounds of music to my ears !!! :-)In my life I use In-Ear Monitors are Thinksound TS-02 with mic, Klipsch S4-A Image with mic, Klipsch Reference S4 Premium, and Klipsch Image X10 no mic, on the go driven by Samsung GS3 US spec (Qualcomm DAC, not Wolfson DAC, as in International version - I presume 500 PRO will sound even better with Wolfson DAC), at home I listen to Yamaha Pro 500 headphones driven by Yamaha RX-V671 Receiver, Bi-Amp wired with C2G 12AWG speaker wires to Polks Monitor 70s Series II. PC-Build rig is used with Senns 280 Pro (for movies, games, music, all driven by Creative SB ZX sound card with PC headphone amp). I mainly listen to 320 kbps MP3 and Apple or FLAC Lossless (ripped from my CDs) music files stored on 64 Gb Micro SDXC flash on my Samsung Galaxy S3/IPod Classic 5th Gen (bought my 4 IPods when I still respected Apple brand, no more respect for Apple) or on computer hard drive (DLNA to Yamaha receiver).Update 02/23/2013Excellent overall, Depeche Mode's "Wrong" shines, Yams handle complicated and deep bass sound stages with aplomb, with multiple octaves, and all from Samsung Galaxy S3, no headphone amp, just Android software PowerAmp pre-amp on the 60% level. Music feels like you have 3-4 speakers blowing into each ear, separate speaker for bass and low frequencies, separate for high, separate for mids, Yams are very articulate, each dimension of music has its own very separate sound space, and you can hear it clearly very spaced out and coming off a different angle, each instrument separate ...Also, if you have a small head, be advised, these headphones are big. They are even larger than Sennheiser HD 280 PRO's headphones. Initially when I bought headphones, I had them on the smallest setting. Now I extend hinges for 2 or 3 mm (1/16 of an inch) on each retractable hinge side, on my medium-to-large head. The headband is wide too, I guess for extra comfort, even though they sit tightly on my ears. After first month of use headphones loosened up on the sides, becoming more comfortable to wear, and as a result sitting a little bit higher on the head, so I started retracting them 2-3 mm outwards to keep them on my ears. Yams are still comfortable though, for their size and those huge magnets in ear-cups speakers (50 mm diameter magnet on each side, real rare earth metal neodymium magnets). So if they don't feel right away, do not give up, Yams loosen up on the sides and sit higher, so if originally they are too big for you, they may fit in a month of use ...update 03/23/13sides are much looser now, clamping force is on par to worn-out Senns HD 280. Found out due to the differences in music soundscape requirements it helps to adjust amp level in Power Amp Android App - if I want the music to be soft, "Enigmatic", whispering, non-fatiquing for hours to go, so to say the background fone music for studying, I lower the pre-amp level below middle point, somethere to 35-40% of the bar, and music becomes very unobtrusive and relaxing. If I want the music to shine to full potential and the treble/bass to be agressive, and frequency bands booming, for Depeche Mode, LP, Deep Purple, Pendulum, DDT, Cure, Pink Floyd, Adele, anything strong, heavy, loud, powerful, I move pre-amp to 70% or even 80% of the bar. I never have to use 100% pre-amp, like on Senns HD-280, as with Yams music becomes too harsh, they are too powerful to over-amp them,  and yes, you can over-amp Yams with little output of Power Amp on Galaxy S3 :-)... Om some tracks I listen volume gradient one notch up from silent/off - and the music is still loud, but there is no where to go lower. Yams are loud and powerful, but you can control them.update 03/31/13 (also posted on head-fi dott org)Yamaha 500 PRO is not not bass heavy, it is bass powerful though, I can tell it after owning them for 3 months. Bass is very controllable. I listen most of the time to FLAC/AAC/MP3 (128 to 320 kbps) on Samsung Galaxy S3 equipped with PowerAmp music app, PowerAmp has software control of output level of S3 (Pre Amp function). Rarely do I have to lower Pre Amp down or reduce bass freqs to clean bass from mids, because on Yams bass has tonality, octaves, I went to musical school in the past, and can hear the bass "dancing with music" - in other words it flows very much with mids, supporting mids if mid are present during bass frequencies spikes and happens to be delivered at the same time - mids and bass are very separate, and bass bounces below and around mids, it will only blow all frequencies away if you boost the bass or over-equalize it.So, do not be afraid of bass on Yams, but you will enjoy bass on them very much, huge aluminum-alloy metal housing of the drivers make bass very quick and tight, it flashes/spikes/tones up and down instantly, letting you hear all in between the flashes/spikes/tones changes.Now I understand why is the extra weight is on them - it is the price for that exceptional quick-dancing and bouncing bass. I never heard such quick bass before Yams.Also, as per comfort, you will get used to them, and they loose considerably over time (now they slide off my head if I tilt my head forward, just like my Senns 280 HD do :-)P.S. under influence on Yamaha PRO 500 I also got Yamaha EPH-100 SL, I was so impressed with 500 PRO.update 05/01/2013Yamaha PRO 500 headphones had finally "burned-in", after several months of daily use ... the main improvement is the sound ... bass become less isolated and cascading more in tune with lower-mids, vocals came out clearer,subtle highs are now present where I had not heard them before, the very subtle "behind-the-main-sound-stage" tonalities now come through ... Classical music is more defined after break-in, especially highs .. Headphones became very comfortable, clamping force is gone, my ears now adjusted to being slightly bent-in by the top and the bottom of round ear-pads ... and I am very pleased with Yamaha EPH-100 SL in-ear monitor phones as well ... only downside cannot get no COMPLY foams for them, have to use stock flimsies, that provide inferior sound isolation ...01-15-2014 updateYams are holding strong, got Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 3, now the mic and button work with the phone, can use mic for phone conversations, and button to play/pause/forward songs, or make calls. With Note 3 the quality of sound is much better comparing to S3, DAC is far better, but still not as spacious as listening through Yamaha RX-671 Burr-Brown DAC.

$review_text.: I purchased this battery for use with a Dell D830Keep in mind that there are several different vendors selling this battery, so you really don't know what you're getting, as far as manufacturer and age.I bought my battery from Bay Valley Parts, due mainly to how close they are, hoping for quick shipping.  My old battery was completely dead, so anything would have been better.What I got was a no-name battery with a defective charge indicator.  It does not have any manufacturer name on it, and no "LB1 High Performance Pro Series" markings like the picture. I knocked off a star due to the battery indicator not working.  The indicator in the computer works fine, it is the indicator lights on the battery that don't work.When I first installed it, I noticed that it fit exactly like the OEM battery, which was a relief.  I have purchased no-name batteries before that needed work with a Dremel to latch in place.As shipped, it had 57% charge, which is very good.  A Li-Ion battery will last a very long time at about 1/2 charge.  It irks me when a battery is shipped almost dead, or fully charged, as that means that the battery has lost some life before it is even put in use.One thing that is slightly different is that, with the OEM battery, one can move the release, and then pull the battery out after letting go of the release.  With this battery, I have to hold the release until the battery has been removed.  This is a bit more awkward, but not bad.Battery life is great.  I am getting 6 hours of browsing with the screen turned down to half-brightness.  At full brightness, I get 6 hours.I will update as the battery ages, but I am currently very happy with it.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent Replacement battery at an affordable price.

$review_text.: I have a lot of difficulty rating the 60CSx because I'm still not sure what it can and cannot do, or whether I'm doing things correctly. This is because it has the WORST SET OF INSTRUCTIONS, or for many things, NO INSTRUCTIONS, than any other electronic gadget I've ever used - and that's a whole lot.I am a computer tech, and I know that computers and software, sophisticated cell phones and the like have a well earned reputation for poor documentation, but I've never seen anything like this.The quarter inch thick manual really says nothing that you actually need to know, and the REQUIRED 24K Topo Maps have essentially no documentation at all. I spent a couple of days with this unit on my computer and one day in the field before I even began to figure out how to use it for my needs. And at one point, the maps, which I had successfully gotten to load on the GPS, suddenly vanished on the computer, leaving me with the useless basemaps.First of all, If you don't purchase the 100$+ 24K maps you might as well not bother with this unit, since what it comes with is put to shame by any 69$ automotive unit.And I think the most aggravating thing of all is that a few lines of instructions and explanation in certain places would solve most of the problems. In particular, just a sequence of steps to set up and use the GPS with the maps, including downloading data to your computer and using it, would be a great benefit.There were a few basic things not mentioned, and because I didn't know them or have any way of knowing, I went around chasing my tail for quite a while, including installing all the software two or three times.As far as I can see the unit works pretty well - if you ever figure it out - and I'm not at all sure I've done that yet.

Compared to my old Nikon D40, it was really convenient not having to swap out lenses all the time. Saved a TON of hiking with the 42x zoom. Found out the digital zoom only works with the switch on the lens, not the one on the shutter button - but trying to photograph anything at that distance is going to require a tripod or other stabilization equipment (like the railing of a cruise ship). Also doesn't take up as much space as my old D40 and two lenses.

$REVIEW.: Yes, that's correct - component (not composite) video


 A lot of folks don't realize, or go into a store and become sold on expensive cables that specifically perform to a single standard, but regular RCA cables designed for audio will successfully deliver component video signals


 Perhaps several years ago, there was a dire need to reduce interference and electrical noise by buying shielded cables and expensive surge protectors


 Today, most equipment inherently account for these variations and have their own filters and clipping circuits built in
 However, if you live within ten feet of a power substation, or happen to be running huge inductive loads like an electric furnace that a person could walk in - then you might have to worry
 Otherwise, don't fret :o)A pack of these connectors will cost you less than a standard component video cable, and allow you to upgrade ones you already own if space becomes limited behind your device


This was the case with us after purchasing a new television and mounting it to the wall, only to realize we still had to use some of the rear-facing connections


 We popped these adapters on the end of the existing cable and viola - turned it into a low-profile cable that routes perfectly in a tiny space.Quality is good - what does that mean?  Sometimes, when a seller offers a product like this in bulk, it's because that person bought someone else's scrap product that is too loose, too tight, or has a bad or shorted connection, etc
 It happens more often than you think...particularly on popular auction websites
 Fortunately, that isn't the case here

 The connections we made are tight, the conductive plating is not discolored or flaking, and the end result is a clear and high definition picture from the source device
 Top rating and review are deserved.I feel confident writing this and recommending the product to others


 Please feel free to add comments or questions and I'll do my best to help.

$review_text.: Great price for a super compact 64GB drive. I bought it at walmart assuming that it was only a USB 2.0 drive and thinking it would read/write about 15-20 MB/s, but it only writes between 5-10 MB/s.  It's super slow, but I'm still happy with it for something to keep in my pocket.Just don't buy it if you're going to get upset about the low transfer speeds.Update: I wrote this review after using this drive only on my Windows 8 ultrabook.  The slow speeds are consistent on all of its USB ports (both 2.0 and 3.0).  I noticed that on my Windows 7 desktop, this drive transfers consistently at about 24 MB/s read or write.  I'm not sure why there is the difference.  The ultrabook's transfer speeds are similar to the desktop's on all of my other drives.  Perhaps this thumb drive doesn't have good drivers for Windows 8 yet.

$REVIEW.: WoW!  Are you kidding me?  I&#8217;m so distrustful of anything with a suction cup for mounting, that initially I was guarded and leery it wouldn&#8217;t hold.  I mounted it (and of course my expensive Gopro camera) on my motorcycle fairing.  Although the manufacture assured me that it would hold, my plan &#8220;B&#8221; was to tether it using an adhesive anchor.  After a 1500 mile cross country tour on my bike, it held securely the entire trip.  I&#8217;m amazed!  The &#8220;icing on the cake&#8221; is I took some beautiful footage driving down the highway.  WoW!

$REVIEW.: What a disappointment
 The battery cover does not work on a eTrex Venture CX model
 What a disappointment


 The CX has a flash card slot on the upper left which requires a notch in the cover

 This one does not have the notch so it will not fit
 I also do not have the o-ring mentioned by the other reviewer so I am not sure if it will seal 100% on regular units anyway.What a bummer I threw away the packaging before I actually tried to mount it on the bicycle anyway


 What a bummer.

$SUMMARY.: It does not work for a etrex venture CX

$review_text.: Altec Lansing M402SR Moondance Glow Speaker System with Clock Radio, Snooze Remote, and iPod Dock (Black)I was so looking forward to testing out this iPod dock radio combination. Reality, is a BIG disappointment.  At a retail of $180 I expect something for my money. This device does not deliver. The unboxing is a straight forward if unexciting affair. Cardboard box surrounding molded Styrofoam. Nothing fancy or special, but efficient. The radio arrived in perfect condition.  The device looks "OK" but is rather plain in style. Two grilled speakers on either side of an stowable iPod dock, the small display/clock in the upper right. Nothing that will win design awards.  With the possible exception of the light-up touch controls on the top. They are cute but really lack any tactile senses. They work but are difficult to feel if it's by your bed and it's dark. They would be higher than your line of sight.The major purpose of this device is docking an iPod, and for real utility a Touch.  Here is brought to bear the major fault with this device. The dock is a slide out affair that doesn't really lock in the extended position as much as stops there.  Because of that when you touch the iPod controls you tend to flex it in the dock.  It makes for a less than perfect control arrangement. I am using an iPod Touch (gen 1) for these purposes and it's a royal pain to use.  There are numerous radio station apps for the touch that give the Moondance the ability to be a world radio. If it wasn't such a chore to use it in this configuration. The remote lets you control some iPod features and that's good, but trying to use the Touch screen on the iTouch is frustrating at best. I REALLY wanted this to work well! I am so disappointed. The FM feature is kind of crippled as you need the remote to access the 4 count them 4 presets. Don't lose the remote! There is also no AM tuner at all.  There is also no headphone jack, but unless you want to listen to FM in private, it's not much of an omission. If you have a Touch the radio section is redundant with all the radio apps available, many of which are free or inexpensive.The last two "features" are a remote sleep timer button thing. It works and is a larger target than the light array on the top of the radio. The Glow light is superfluous and a marketing gimmick. The sound it produces is OK but nothing that would win any awards.  The remote is thin and flimsy. If by the pictures you think it's backlit, it is not, just painted to look that way.  A disappointing box from Altec. Too bad.

$review_text.: Picture Quality Rating (HD): 9/10We thoroughly enjoyed reviewing the C7000 plasma series last year and we know that these TVs can deliver a great picture quality. The D7000 series also renders a superb picture, but slightly different than what we saw last year. First, let's start with the Picture Mode options which are fairly limited compared to many TVs we review. Preset Modes are Dynamic, Standard, Movie, and Relax. The Relax and Movie modes are pretty solid right out the box. We ISF calibrated the picture from the Movie Mode to D6500K and post those picture settings on the next page. We then measured peak brightness and peak black to determine a range of contrast and this is where we were first surprised. Contrast measures about half on the D7000 series than it did last year. We found the reason for the decrease to be less light output (brightness) rather than black performance. We attribute this decrease to one or both of the following explanations: 1) Plasma panel Image retention (not burn in) issues could have influenced Samsung to decrease light output and/or 2) Samsung had to reduce light output to meet internal or external energy consumption reduction requirements. Indeed as it relates to the second possible reason, there is a yellow sticker affixed to the TV that states an average annual $28 in power costs. OK, I can see a small reduction in light output to accommodate the first of these, but power costs? I think I prefer to pay an extra $1 per month or even $2 more per month to get a better contrast ratio. Haven't we gone overboard enough with this energy efficiency when it comes to TVs? We here at 3D-TVBuyingGuide.com are proponents of the best picture quality possible and not at the expense of the lowering the power bill by a buck a month to meet an external non-profit agencies requirements.OK, that said, how is the picture quality? Excellent, just like last year. Colors are realistic and explosive, black levels are inky deep, dark shadow detail is excellent even with dark and light colors in the scene. The latter of these attributes is one of the traits that sets these plasma TVs apart from LED and LCD technologies. That and off center side angle viewing which is perfect on this plasma as it is with most. There is no false countouring or mapping of color information. The only weaknesses with the picture is judder jerkiness during slow panning side to side and peak light output. The first of these weaknesses is present in almost all TVs, the second causes us to recommend this TV for light controlled rooms.3D TV Viewing: 3D viewing is much improved from last year. The PN51D7000 is full HD active shutter 3D and comes with Samsung's 3D starter kit which includes 2 pairs of active shutter 3D glasses model SSD-3100GB and a Shrek 3D movie. The TV recognizes when the 3D glasses are synced and an alert pops up on the screen stating, "3D Glasses are now connected." Many of the issues we noted last year are gone. There was no blurring in the bottom left and right corners of the screen. There was no crosstalk and flashing from the glasses from ambient room light. Images looked great and the depth is excellent depending on the 3D movie. The PND7000 3D plasma technology does justice to 3D technology. It certainly involves you in the picture. We did note some eye fatigue after viewing for a while but not as much as last year.Picture Quality Rating (Non-HD): 9/10Up conversion of lower end signals is very impressive on the PN51D7000. This is important due to the way we increasingly watch TV these days - through Internet TV programming like Netflix, Hulu and Vudu. These services do not always transmit their signals in HD and even when it is, it's usually a ramped down 720p HD rather than 1080p. Many times you are watching something akin to 480i or 480p resolution. So a good quality up conversion in a TV is essential and to get this you will likely need to go to a more high end solution like the D7000. Color information was very good despite the fact that you cannot adjust picture settings from the Smart Hub Internet options. The tools key will get you into the Sound Mode options but that's it. Nevertheless, in the end we were happy with the color, black levels, and especially the dark shadow detail on this TV.Features Rating: 9.5Internet Connectivity Smart Hub: Samsung's Smart Hub has probably the best selection of Internet TV Apps and Options on the market. There are the usual must haves like Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, ESPN, USA Today, AP, Accuweather. Some of the Apps are more worthy than others. The MLB.tv App shows todays game times and scores, and standings but no video clips or reruns. If you want to access the games, you'll have to subscribe to the premium service. Many small Apps like Pac man or various workout video apps cost between .99 and 2.99 each. One drawback of Samsung's Smart Hub is that you cannot access the picture menu to calibrate the picture. You must just watch it as it comes in - not that performance is poor, it isnt at all, but it's always nice to be able to calibrate the settings.Design and Appearance: The Samsung PN51D7000 looks much the same as the PND8000 series from last year except with a thinner framing bezel. It's a great looking set. The thin 1" brushed charcoal metallic finish lends a very expensive look and the depth of the TV is the same at just 1.4". There is a thick glass edging all the way around the TV. The screen when off is a deep rich charcoal color. The TV comes with a solidly built heavy table top which swivels 21 degrees side to side. Lastly, the neck is a clear acrylic piece that makes the TV look as if it's floating in air.Audio Output Quality: Audio output was impressive from the 10W X 10W speakers. Compared to most super thin TVs these days, sound from the PND7000's speakers is much fuller with more base and better quality. There was plenty of volume to fill a large room at the 50% level. There are impressively 5 Sound Mode options whereas most TVs only have two. We have preferred the Clear Voice option in the past so give that one a try. The Standard mode is also good. Music was not great but we felt the sound quality was well balanced.Value Rating: 9.5/10The PN51D7000 is an extremely attractive TV that has a classy and expensive looking casing to go with a superb picture quality and features. With excellent 3D performance and great black levels this TV is tough to compete with at a price $1647 from authorized online dealers. A Samsung 3D starter kit with 2 pairs of 3D shutter glasses and a free 3D movie or two will cost an extra $398 - though some retailers may charge a higher price for the TV but include the starter kit.See the full review along with our video review at 3D TV Buying Guide

 The Belkin couldn't handle the connection


 This router handled the connection with ease
 The setup is very quick and easy


 If you don't have experience manually setting up routers, then follow the instructions on the quick setup guide and setup will go along very quickly
I highly recommend this router.

$REVIEW.: My motherboard on my computer outputs digital optical, but I needed to route the cable under a desk, around a wall, up a credenza. This cable is soft and pliable, secure fitting at the end and works perfectly. The price is right as well, and the company claims a lifetime warranty. Light is light. You don't need to spend more for any reason. If the light goes from one end to the other and is read by your DA converter, it will sound EXACTLY the same as any other cable you could buy. If you can find cheaper, buy it. But this was the least expensive cable I found that had what appeared to be nice, molded terminals.

$REVIEW.: It works as advertised if you know how to use it, unlike other reviewers who are disappointed.I used the middle size first, for few months then switched to smaller size, it fits my ears better. For men over 40 should trim their ear hair before using any buds, before complaining. I'm over 50 it works fine for me. It's easily cleaned with warm water & hand soap, shake off water & dries in seconds. No more ear wax clogging the ear buds. No change in sound quality & no more ear ache from long duration use. It's a well engineered product. You have to work it to fit your ear, so it stays long, firm & comfortable. It's the difference between wearing a sweat pants with elastic waist verses a dress pants with a belt, one has to work the dress pants, make it fit then put your belt on. I guess lazy people like sweat pants, just pull it up & go. If you are a sweat pants type, then this product is not for you.

I was originally going to order a cheaper Logitech mouse but when I saw this one go on sale I had to snatch one up for my home use.  I basically like every aspect about this mouse, the back/forward buttons, the zoom buttons, the ability to switch between applications without touching the keyboard and most of all the ergonomics of it.  My hand doesn't cramp up or tire out after a long session of surfing when I'm using it.The only bad thing was that the included Logitech cd was missing.  I solved that by going to Logitech's website and downloading the software.  Everything works just fabulous!

$REVIEW.: Bottom line - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money.  Don't buy this one.. keep looking.  This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

$review_text.: This is an exceptional MP3 player for the price, without the limited usability that IPOD implements in order to stop piracy..

they're only losing customers who have more than one PC and buy their music like me.Let me see..

$200 for a 40GB MP3 player from Creative, or $599 for an Ipod..


not a difficult choice.I found setup to be very difficult indeed, and I am an advanced PC user

 The driver on this disc wouldn't install, so I had to manually download and install the device driver from the Creative website
(This is why it gets 4 stars and not 5)

 Also, the installation instructions are pretty poor


 It will say things like, "In the content menu select your music, and hit the send to device button"  Unfortunately for us, it doesn't give pictoral represtentations of what or where these buttons are, and the in screen buttons don't have a pop up label when you hover your cursor over it

 Very frustrating, but, eventually you'll figure it out..
unless the driver doesn't install on your PC either, then you're left to either manually install it or contact Tech support on how to do this.I've read a lot of complaints about not being able to arrange by folders..


but you can arrange by playlist


 Either manually, which will take forever, or hook it up to your PC, and use the Nomad Explorer program to open your Nomad files on your PC and manipulate the player at your PC's keyboard (much faster)


 You can sort, arrange, and do almost anything with this

 Arranging the files by playlist is virtually the same thing as arranging them by folder, and you can store all of a certain type or band to a playlist for easy access

 Though, you can not create sub-playlists, which would be conveinant if you wanted to sort a band with several albums

 It would be more conveniant to sort each album to a playlist.So, though the initial instalation was a little tedious, the device program for filing information really isn't as bad as everyone is making it sound, and its easy to 'Playlist' a group of songs from your PC.It has Superb music quality and volume.I would recommend this product based upon Price, quality of sound, and volume.But be prepared for a slightly challenging instal


 Still, worth the $300 I saved!!!

$REVIEW.: I am not much of a photographer.  Do not get me wrong, I like to take pictures.  I am just not very good at it.  For a couple of years now I have had a small camera, which I have enjoyed very much and have taken many "okay" pictures with it.  This camera manages to increase the quality of my photos without much effort on my part.  Of course, the fact that the colors are more vibrant and the image is crisper is down to the camera itself.  However, the nicer features, like the great zoom and better stabilization than my old camera, means even mediocre (at best) photographers like me can get great results.  Other reviewers have gone into many of the features, so I will not repeat that here.  I will however note that, like most electronics I review, I start out the "old fashioned" American way and see what I can figure out without looking at the directions (not that we are ignorant, we are just ferociously independent!).  I was able to use many of the features by trial and error so I think someone would be able to operate it pretty well straight out of the box.  That turns out to be a great thing since the manual is not very helpful.  All-in-all, I think it is a good camera for a casual photographer and it can help improve your shots if you are photo-impaired like me.

$REVIEW.: The Good:  They look and feel very cool and are solidly built.  The audio is great for electronic/club/dance/rap music.  Really strong bass considering it doesn't use batteries like other earphones.  They support telephone calls with the mic in the cable.  Speaking of which the cables it comes with feel solid which is GREAT!  It comes with two.  One just a straight cable and another with a microphone if you're plugging it into a phone.The Bad:  These headphones are NOT mean to be moved.  If you use them while you are walking you get a LOUD pounding from your footsteps because the noise cancelling comes from the near airtight seal it forms around your ears.  If you have sensitive ears they will bother you after a while because of the pressure they apply on your head.  Callers have reported a slightly muffled sound when using the microphone as opposed to standard microphone earphones that come with your mobile phones.The Ugly: The rubber seal on the top doesn't fit well and it is uncomfortable.  They headphones are kind of heavy and the cushion is NOT nearly soft enough to hold the weight.  Every single SOLO HD headphones I have seen separate from the edge on the headband.  There is a bulge near the metal extender and I've seen it completely fall off after some time on some of these headphones.  The size is kind of weird.  Any adult will require extending it losing the cool look.  Unless you use them hanging backwards but they are too heavy for that and slip down after a while.  Not to mention that if the headband touches your shirt at all a LOUD rubbing sound while far overpower whatever music you're listening to.The Summary:  The audio is pretty good.  The style is nice.  The cables are very good.  Ultimately I have an issue with the headband build for all the reasons mentioned above.  If you don't plan on moving around then these headphones will be great for you.  Strange though considering they are the ones with the microphone for you to use...while moving.

$REVIEW.: This little gadget is great! I have an older tv which has only one HDMI port in the back of the set, of course, so I was constantly having to move the set and find the cables to switch from my Roku (a great device for streaming, BTW) and my DVR. Now they're connected to the switcher and it automatically tunes to the Roku, unless I have a dvd loaded; in which case it switches over to the DVR. Most of the time I don't even need to use the remote. And when the DVR stops it takes less than a minute and it switches right back.

$REVIEW.: Would liked to have written a more lengthy review of this product, but someone ripped off my camera and bag full of accessories
But before that I set the camera on a tripod and took several photos from about 20 foot away from the camera and the remote worked well
Took some photos with a 300 mm lens and there was no blur using the remote.

$review_text.: I had vacuumed my original phone cord and it was destroyed.  I was trying to decided if I should purchase this cord or an Apple cord.  Well, on the Apple site the cord was 2x more expensive.  And the reviews were horrible!  So I purchased this cord from Amazon hoping it will fit with my case.I have the Otter Box Commuter case and it fit perfectly. The cord works perfectly, and it was way cheaper!If you don't have an Otter Box then I would recommend searching through all the reviews till you see if the plug will fit the case.
$review_summary.: Perfect! And fits my case fine.

This makes it a great choice for most consumers, who will see a real benefit in startup times, application launches, and opening documents.

$REVIEW.: There has been plenty already written about this camera, so I am only going to mention the one feature nobody seems to have noticed. The camera body has a square bottom and a very well balanced center of gravity. That means you can take self-timer pictures by balancing the camera on a rock, car hood, or fence post. That is in case you forgot or didn't want to carry a tripod.Many other cameras (Casio and Sony come to mind) have a rounded or irregular bottom or a tendency to topple in one direction, which means you have to carry a small tripod in your other pocket at all times if you're planning to take self-pictures using the timer. I just took my first hiking trip with the SD1000, forgot the tripod, and it turned out the tripod is not nearly as critical as it had been with my other cameras!Complaints: The date-stamp feature only works in 1600x1200 mode.

$review_text.: Loads movies very slowly, especially if they are blu-ray


 Sometimes it just 'locks up' and won't function at all


 I have to hold the power button in until I &#34;force&#34; it to shut off

 Then I start it up and try again
 Tedious
 Ready to eject your movie?  Even THAT takes longer than it should
 Push the button and wait...and wait...and wait


 Why?  I do have it connected to the internet to get firmware updates, but those haven't made the unit function any better
 And then there is the remote control


 The red lettering on the black background is very difficult to see and trying to determine what button controls which function is an exercise in frustration and futility


 Lest you think I'm a &#34;Sony Hater&#34;, I have a different Sony Blu-ray on another TV and it has been great AND the remote control for it is much better labeled and laid out
 Why is THIS machine so much worse?  Not sure

 But you've been warned
 Find something else...

$review_text.: I purchased 4 laptops from Amazon...the XA1 model, the A1 model, 3 were 17 inch and one was 15 inch.  After sending all 4 back here is my take on ASUS and the republic of gamers laptop.  First off none were impacted by the new Sandy Beach processor (at least not that I was able to single out).  The bottom line is either you get a good one or a bad one.  Regardless some things are the same. Frist, yes there is bloatware and no two reivewers have removed it the same way and once you do there are messeage errors that haunt your system.  The lighted keyboard is sometimes working and sometimes not working.  Yes you can reload drivers or press fn and f4 or you can reboot or you can pray but in the end its always something and there are multiple ways to fix the problem however does the solution stick (I am not sure it does).  Yes sleak design and great feel, and packed with a lot of punch and amazing display....but how many times do you have to reinstall the software after you have backed it up for 2 1/2 hrs? I am not going to discuss the weight or size of battery life cause its a gaming laptop and the last 5 reviews have all been on the money.  Asus needs to pay attention to detail and take care of the things mentioned over and over again.  Yes put some things on the back of the laptop so right handed and left handed folks dont have the power cord and other devices in their way.  I believe ASUS has built the best bang for the buck and can do even better by paying atteniton to the words that others have taken time to write.  I will more than likely give this another try and pray the 5th time is a charm.  I have a desk top with ASUS COMPONENTS AND IT ROCKS!!!  ASUS IF YOU ARE LISTENING ...GIVE US BACK UP DISKS ALL READY TO GO...GET RID OF BLOATWARE YOU CAN DO WELL WITHOUT IT (VOLUME SALES).  Hard drives not be divided.....You are kicking ALIENWARE AND OTHERS TO THE CURB. Read carefully the reivewers from AMAZON CUSTOMERS AND YOU WILL GO FAR. As for me, I am going to buy another one and hope this time I get a laptop that works and not one that dies, freezes, sends me error messages when I try to connect to the internet, goes blank after rebooting, lets me play WOW without kicking me off the game on numerous occasions, and last but not least....delivers everything its meant to deliver and more........I will follow up with another review after I get my next laptop.  By the way the 4 laptops were purchased during the month of May.  On another note...Amazon is the best and took great care of me...my hat goes off to them for sending me out laptop after laptop.....Your customer service is the best...THANK YOU AMAZON YOU ARE A CLASS ACT.

So now I have an 8 G memory setup but mostly run 32 bit XP.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I purchased this board to use as a RAID-5 backup for my ASUS 775 socket board.I put a Celeron Core2DUO in it and all was well until I decided to put a faster CPU.With an E6420 ( 2.13/4M/1066/86) processor it three beeps at power up whichmeans the memory is not compatible.I have ordered Crucial web-site recommended memory for this setup and willbe trying that soon to see if I can keep the faster processor installed.Only other issue is the battery setup is weird and I ended up breaking itand had to electrical tape it into place.  It's unclear how to remove/replace.The ICH10R raid chipset is working fine but you need to pay attention to thesoftware requirement that you have .NET 3.5 installed.

$REVIEW.: As with other iPad owners, I researched every possible case for my iPad.  The reason I finally decided on the Zerochroma was because of the portrait & landscape option, as well as the different angles.  When I received it, it was perfect.  However, if you like using a particular angle, it will no longer hold after repeated use.  I've had it for close to a year and after about 6 months, I can no longer use two of the angles (as they were my favorites).  I am now researching AGAIN for that perfect case.  Bummer.

The UI is fast and much improved, but many setup and ip streaming menus are still SD.  When it switches down to SD, it is not great, but usually it is a short and rare occurrence.  Tivo UI engineers should address this as soon as streaming outside the home is complete!I am only giving 4 stars due to incomplete HD menus, incomplete streaming to my iPad/iphone outside of my LAN.  Once these are complete, Tivo Roamio will be 5 star.

$REVIEW.: I bought this mainly because my old Onkyo HT receiver only had 3 HDMI inputs and I was tired of playing "HDMI musical chairs" with all of my components.  When I bought it it was priced at $199, but in the weeks since the holidays it's gone up almost $50!  I was going to buy one for my parents, but I think I'll wait and see if it goes down again.I did not have the "brick out of the box" problem that other people have reported.  I simply transferred all my cables from my old Onkyo, turned it on and it worked.  I then let it update via Ethernet and did not have any problems at all.  It took me a bit to find the audio setting that sounded most like my old set up, but other than that everything was easy.I also have not experienced the HMDI out failures that others have reported so far.I'm using it in a bedroom, so it's powered just about right for a smaller room.  If you are looking for something to really shake the house off its foundation in a larger room, you are probably better off going with one of the higher wattage units, but this one works well as a secondary or small room unit.

$review_text.: After 3 years of using a Tamron 28-75mm, I finally bought the 24-105L for its wider range and build / image quality.Every good thing that's been said about this lens is true, so I won't bother repeating it. I'd like to rate this lens 4.5 stars, but that is obviously not a choice. The zoom ring is a little stiff - being able to adjust would be nice. And I find myself missing the larger aperture of the Tamron.Other pros compared to Tamron 24-75:The difference in FOV between 24mm and 28mm is actually pretty noticeable, to my surprise.Build quality, even the hood. The hood for the Tamron is stiff and takes some force to attach / detach. The Canon hood goes on effortlessly, and the interior is lined with a black velvety material.Cons:There seems to be a fair amount of distortion at 24mm.Price, of course.Would I buy it knowing what I did? I guess so. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice in not picking up the 24-70mm instead. But IS is very nice to have.

 I currently have a pair and use them everyday on my commute on BART

 My pair replaced a pair of Shure E3C that I lost

The sound reproduction is accurate and the fit comfortable
 The isolation is pretty good

 The ER6i are pretty durable, and have lasted several years and still looks great


 The only issue I had with my pair is replacing the filters which gets clogged after some months of use
 The set came with one pair of replacement filters


 I would also recommend purchasing some extra filters (ER6I-50).The ER6i's come with various tips to adjust fit


 None of the tips fit my ear well, so I used the tips from my Shure E3C

$REVIEW.: Considering its low cost, I was not surprised when I received the AmazonBasics Large Gadget Bag from the Amazon Vine Program and discovered that it is not large.  In fact, it is rather small.  However, it does have a cute, compact, fashionable design that is gender friendly, meaning it is suitable for both males and females.  I attached the strap that was tucked inside the bag and carried it over my shoulder.  I carried it to work and told them it was my new man bag.  Most all of my coworkers are female.  Several remarked that it looked nice.  I used the bag to carry my lunch; it is the size of a lunch box.After work, I went to the local library down the street from where I live and carried my portable CD player, small spiral notebook, hardback novel, iPhone, and headset inside my AmazonBasics Large Gadget Bag.  I like to listen to novels on audio CD while reading along in the actual hardback novel.  I enjoy having someone else read to me for a change; it reminds me of when I was a child and my mom read to me.  The bag was easy to carry to the library and no one really noticed me with it.  It is very compact and fashionable.  Everything was easily placed inside and removed.  However, my largest item, a hardback novel, barely fit inside.I easily removed the gray Velcro interior and used the bag as an overnight bag when I recently house sat for Dr. Lee, a friend of mine who left town on an emergency.  He owns a menagerie of pets that I must feed.  The bag was barely large enough to hold an extra T-shirt, underwear, and toiletries.  There are plenty of pockets for small gadgets such as my alarm clock, Apple iPhone 4 and charger.  Granted, room was a little tight, but I managed to squeeze everything in there without damaging anything.  Because it was heavier than normal, I carried it by its handles as though it were a suitcase.  This bag has a lot of straps and handles.The AmazonBasics Large Gadget Bag is a strong, sturdy bag, but it is only suitable for carrying small gadgets such as digital cameras, smart phones, e-book readers, GPS devices, docking stations, etc.  It is not as large as I thought it was.  It makes a nice lunch box, carrying case for makeup, and overnight bag, but is not suitable for carrying large electronics like laptops and portable Blu-Ray DVD Players.  I contemplated getting two for my nephews who are both computer geeks.  However, when I saw how small they actually were, I decided to pass.  I'll wait and buy them each a bag that is more the size of an average gym bag; however, I'm sure I'll pay a hefty price for them.Joseph B. Hoyos

$REVIEW.: I decided to buy this headset, because it has over 1000 reviews, mostly positive. However, these are my points of assessment:Comfort: I don't know what most people consider to be "comfortable", but this set does not fit for me. It feels awkward, with its ark at the rear of my head, and it does not hug my ears snugly enough. When I lean back against my high sofa seat or pillows, the beam behind my head gets in the way and pushes the set off my ears, since it is not precisely snug around the rear of my head.I also wear reading glasses, and the bow of the set gets into a room crisis/conflict with the branches of my glasses right behind and above my ears. There is room for one of those, but not for the both.I wanted to use it for two things: as my speaker system for the laptop and at the same time, to use as the blue-tooth for my iPhone-4. The sound quality for music and sound files played from my laptop is poor, compared to the Plantronics DSP 400 I have been using until now. For my iPhone, I tried to pair it 3 times. I turned it off, then on again, to be discovered. It signaled that it was paired for phone calls, but upon testing it by calling my husband's iPhone-4, I never got to hear anything in the headset. I had to turn to the phone's speaker system instead. Maybe it needs that separate adapter that they also mention (although they claim it works with the iPhone "guaranteed".For all these poor performance reasons, it goes back into the box and returned for a refund.

$REVIEW.: I listen to my iPod when I am walking or working out.  I like GOOD sound, but am not an expert or a techie.  Anyway, the most impressive thing about these to me is the FIT.  They actually stay in my ears.  Although a great fit is important, it isn't worth as much as these cost.  HOWEVER, the sound quality of these is perfect!  There is a slight lack of bass quality, so for those who like to really FEEL the bass to your toes, pass on these.  But if you like great, crisp clear sound with probably more than adequate bass--these are a great investment.  I fly a lot and these definitely isolate the sound and make traveling more enjoyable.Oh yeah, the remote control works very well too.  LOVE THESE.

I tried it multiple times in multiple configurations with no luck

 I'm confident that it was working &#34;correctly&#34; but that the software was malfunctioning.I was also not a fan of it needing to be plugged in directly to the router since our router is in our basement and the desktop is on the second floor


 It makes it a pain to reset or rearrange for any reason.

$REVIEW.: I only give this 4 out of 5 stars as I believe that there is NOTHING in the world that's perfect.There were a couple of items that disapointed me.1. The device relies on a single, fragile appearing, connector for I/O to a computer or other device via a cable that is too short.2. Charging the battery is only by way of this one connector. I cannot believe that a micro USB B connector couldn't have been placed on the upper edge with the power on/off and volume control. Would have been nice to have a USB connector for an external DVD or HDD/SD drive.On the plus side. . .1. The screen display is beautiful2. The processor seems fast and log on to wi-fi is quick. Bluetooth is quick to start as well.3. The touch screen is far superior to the Dell 1090 which this replaces. Avoid Dell.4. Battery life is good which I attribute greatly to having the SD drive instead of a standard HDD.5. I wanted a tablet but didn't want an Apple.6. I bought the Wi-Fi only rather than 3G/4G since I didn't want to be locked into a cell phone carrier and incur the extra monthly charges to use it.There's lots of places like Public Libraries, Interstate highway reststops,Starbucks, McDonalds and Panera/St. Louis Bread  that have free Wi-Fi.7. Android networking to my LAN is somewhat less that intuitive.

$REVIEW.: The keyboard and mouse are great


 It is very important to download the latest software from Logitech


 That's why I can give 5 stars

 With the old software you couldn't plug and unplug and have the keyboard or mouse work correctly

 That all appears fixed now.I have always loved Logitech mice so when I got my first Mac it was great to see I didn't have to get the Apple branded mouse and keyboard (one mouse button!?).The keyboard is very flat and has a nice wrist rest while not taking up too much room like some of the newer keyboards


 There are a bunch of nice  programmable buttons I use occasionally.The mouse is very nice

It's pretty comfortable and I think it would be good for many different hand sizes


 The additional buttons get a lot of use.The wireless connection works pretty well and the range is as great as I'd ever need.Lastly, both items look pretty slick


 I only wish they came in black because I have a black macbook but I've gotten used to the white and silver.

Granted, these S111 speakers are low priced, but they don't have cheap sound
Don't expect sound quality that an audiophile would rave over, and don't expect much bass--then you won't be disappointed

I don't like the volume control knob, it is too large and being on the back, too cumbersome to use.

I knew there had to be a better way as I saw the beanbag holder for the aviation versions of Garmin when I fly

Lo and behold, this small friction mount is the ticket

It's simple, doesn't budge, and I tuck it behind my passenger seat when not in use

Its very comfortable to wear, the neoprene really helps as does the stretchy material.

$review_text.: Even though I have been a studio recording artist for years, this is my first MP3 player. I've continued to use a Sony Walkman all this time and the bulkiness of a Walkman finally got to me. So, I researched MP3 players quite a bit. The SanDisk SDMX22-004G-A57K Sansa Clip Zip 4 GB had all the features that I was looking for. I ordered a SanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC Class 4 Card along with this unit to give me a total of 36 GB. My feeling is that there was no need to spend the extra money for a Sansa 8 GB when I could add 32 more Gigs by using the money to purchase a card. At first, the MP3's I dragged and dropped into my Sansa wouldn't show up. After some research, I discovered that some of my MP3's were missing what's called an ID3. Once I downloaded a free trial of an ID3 editor and labeled all my MP3's, the MP3 songs showed up in the folders just fine. This is a great little unit. I went to the advanced EQ and set the type of EQ settings that I wanted. It's small and the clip is really valuable. I used to sit on the bus with my Walkman sitting on my lap and it would slide around but with this clip, it stays put. The buttons are easy to use and the screen, although small, is big enough to read. I highly recommend this unit. The accompanying ear buds are not bad but I have a pair of foldable sennheiser Px 200 that isolate outside noise and together, this is a great team. I'm very happy with this unit. Easy to use and very easy to carry around.

$REVIEW.: This sling is the smallest of Caselogic's SLR bags, and is more like an awkward little backpack than a sling.  It's designed to carry a minimal kit (as I usually do) in a small space, like a traveler or enthusiast might.The bag has a very well thought-out layout.  There's no dead-space in the main compartment: you can store things under the "flaps" that support the SLR body (and there's a reach-through from the top pocket).  The top pocket is roomy enough for a flash or additional lens.  The front pocket has two dividers inside it (zipper and mesh), and there's another external pocket suitable for a lens-cap (or keys, or SD card, or).  The small mesh pocket on the side adds another storage spot.  The top handle makes it easy to pick the bag up without stooping to reach for the strap.But, the bag is a bit awkwardly sized.  It's kind of miniature: on my average-build 5'11" male body, it looks like I borrowed my GF's bag (it would actually fit her better than me) and is probably better sized for female builds.Unlike other slings, I couldn't smoothly bring it to the front of my body to get my camera without removing the bag (it's doable, just awkward)-- the squared off side strap prevents this.  It never sits quite flat on my back, tilting outwards a little instead, and the narrow strap looks a bit unflattering on the front of my body (if I tighten it to keep the bag flat on my back, or if there's much weight in the bag).  The straps are cut such that you can not carry this bag over one shoulder like a backpack.  It has to be slung across the body or carried in-hand.My Canon 60D and attached mid-large EF24-105L lens fit fine in this bag.  A bigger lens or bigger body might not have fit.Although Caselogic describes this bag as having a "hammock", it's really just the soft dividers found in most SLR bags-- it doesn't have the elastic "suspended in mid-bag" hammock that their other slings have (eg, mySLRC-205), which I prefer.  Those hammocks avoid having the camera take a shock if you bump or drop the bag, rather than buffering the shock as the foam insulation does.I am a fan of Caselogic products, whose bags tend to be consistently well-made and well-designed.  I carry their olderSLRC-205as my day-to-day camera bag, which I continue to prefer.  This newer bag is not as universally applicable as that sling, but is similarly well-designed and well-made.  Caselogic makes so many bag variations, that one or another will likely fit well if this one doesn't.I rate this bag well since it's suited for certain builds, although it doesn't fit my needs.  If this compact, well-designed bag suits your body type and usage patterns, it's a good choice.
$review_summary.: compact, well-designed bag for smaller users

$review_text.: I'm not an audiophile, as many reviewers seem to be; I'm a 49 year old guy piecing together my first 5.1 surround sound system, not having purchased stereo equipment since the early 1980's.  I was looking for a receiver low in cost, reliable, and one that was easy to set up.  Features, most of which I wouldn't know how to use, were not a priority, though this receiver seems to have plenty of features.I'm VERY happy with this receiver so far.  I almost didn't buy it, based on some reviews that mentioned an 80 page instruction manual.  But based on the reputation of Yamaha, I chose it over an Onkyo.Here's what I'd tell you about the 80 page instruction manual: it's a CD, not paper, and you choose which language you want, and then either print it off, or have it viewable on a tablet or laptop as you set up the system.  I'd normally HATE an 80 page instruction manual, but this one is really well done, and very user friendly.  A lot of thought and time went in to it; it's easy to follow, and understand.  I can't believe I'm giving an 80 page manual an &#34;A+&#34;, but this one deserves it.  Not only did it make it easy to set up the system, it also educated me (again, I'm not a 25 year old audiophile, but a 49 year old guy with limited appetite for this kind of stuff) on everything that a surround sound system can do.I really like the option of choosing settings for different kinds of movies, and for music, choosing different types of listening settings (Munich concert hall, Vienna concert hall, etc.).  I would have thought this to be goofy overkill until I played around with it, but can now see it's a useful feature.My primary use is TV (any music program run through this system sounds tremendous), also playing an iPod through it (again, sounds tremendous), while my son plays an Xbox through it (he's very impressed as well).My center speaker, subwoofer, and ceiling speakers are Polk Audio; front / wall speakers are from Madisound. Everything sounds great!As for all the cables (HDMI, subwoofer, etc.) needed to hook everything up: got it through Amazon at a third, to a quarter, of what Best Buy wanted for the same stuff.As usual, very happy with Amazon for no sales tax, free shipping, and VERY rapid delivery.Thanks Yamaha, Polk Audio, and Amazon.  I'm going to really enjoy this!

$review_text.: I've had this wall mount holding my 60" Samsung D8000 for 7 weeks now


The only extra thing I needed was a few washers so that the M5 screw (provided) didn't go too far into the LED HDTV
This Samsung model is very thin, so I just picked up a few at Lowes

I like to keep my HDTV suspended in mid-air, about 2 feet from the wall
From the viewing position, this 60" now looks like a 70", and it's perfectly angled down at a 15 degree tilt.I installed this mount, and handled my TV all by myself

I do many projects by myself, and get better, and better at it
It takes forethought, but I don't suggest the average person do this
I just mentioned this because it can be done

You'll need a studfinder that can pinpoint the exact middle of a stud


Once you have that, and the leveled height you want the HDTV at, just take your drill, and let it do what it does

If you have wood studs, use the lag screw (bolt) provided

The instructions are straight forward
There are instructions for metal studs also
The cable management is a simple half-cover located on the units right side

Two Phillips screws hold it in place

I bought a washer for each of those screws, and I like how the cover fits better.The unit is heavy, and at first, the motion seems stiff
Now, after 7 weeks, the motion is easier, but not too easy

Wherever you position the HDTV, it will stay there for eternity


I've seen a $300 eqivalent wall mount in Best Buy, and maybe it has a smoother motion because of ball bearings


This VideoSecu wall mount is a better deal in my opinion, as this unit feels more sturdy for the long haul

Also, it cost about $75
Which would you rather spend?

We had it plugged into a very good surge protector and the surge protector was plugged into an excellent line conditioner.  It was operated in a clean, climate controlled environment.  This TV  should not have failed, period!

$REVIEW.: I had the optoma HD70 which was a 720p HD projector and it worked great for 4 years until a power surge killed it


It is now discontinued but I wanted to get another Optoma so I was going to go with the HD20 for the 1080p and take the step up


 After extensive research I decided to get the viewsonic pro8200 because of the extra features(picture in picture) and extended warranty

 Turned out to be a bad choice so I returned it as I could not get it calibrated.I bought the HD66 because I had to test the quality for the money


 Turns out it was a good move and best value for your dollar


 It is calibrated perfectly right out of the box and the picture is crystal clear


 I project from 19 feet away for 120inch screen.I did read alot of the reviews about how it has some issues so I bought the warranty through Amazon just in case I have any issues

For a grand total of $600 bucks I feel secure with my choice for the next 4 years
 This is a great projector and the reason it's so cheap is because of the box you need to run the 3D

 I could care less about 3D so I scored in my opinion

 I couldn't justify buying the HD20 for $300 more when you really can't tell the difference between 720&1080 on a screen so big.If you want a great projector for movies, sports, etc...you will not find something better anywhere near this price range.

$review_text.: I bought this to help my see the keys better.  Some of the colors (Fully configurable) work better than others, but that maybe due to my vision also.The programmable G1-G18 keys are great for just about any command conceivable.  Plus there's three different memory settings, which is great for a keyboard with multiple users, so they may their own G1-G18 key setups.  Or like me, 3 different aspects of computing (Web / Media / Desktop-explorer).The display is limited to what programs Logitech has decided to support (& program authors including code for the KB to access).I find it misses a keystroke about once every two or three sentences. Not sure why, I'm not a speed typist by far. The keys are mostly silent, and require a near full depression to register.* Power button - (turns on/off  lighting) is nice. Although the KB defaults to ON after reboots.* Volume wheel - REALLY sensitive!* Mute key - easier than using the task bar volume control.* Media keys - Play/Pause, Stop, Next & Previous. Again, easier.Overall, I like it for my specific use. As for gaming? I can see where others have complained (especially about missing keystrokes).
$SUMMARY.: Not a gamer, but visually impaired.

$review_text.: The first hard drive I ever bought was a Seagate, and it ran seamlessly for years, so when I needed a new external hd I went right to the Seagate brand. Installation was a snap and the drive was working great for one day. Day two I tried to backup some file to the drive, but it was unfound. Went to my computer, and the drive didn't show. Then  notice the drive light wasn't on. I picked the unit up and it suddenly started, so I put it down and lost it again. It was then I realized there was play in the drives usb input, and unless I held it in a certain position it wouldn't work. I returned to Amazon for a replacement. The second unit seemed okay until I tried to unplug the usb cord, only to have the entire bottom of the drive fall out. I think I'll have to try another brand.

$review_text.: Why spend $55.00 on Amazon's official case?  For $8-12 you can get this case which looks just as nice, performs identically with sleep wake functions, and to my mind, protects about the same. I have always been of the opinion that mobile devices should indeed be mobile. If you are going to put a heavy bulky case onto a sleek device, then I believe it makes the device not as useful or accessible. I like to hold a tablet in one hand and be able to slip it into my messenger bag without adding any significant weight, This case is about half the weight of the official one, so even more portable. Something to bear in mind about heavier cases(even ones not that bulky like the official one), is that you are more likely to drop the case the tablet, the heavier it is. For those that are not really going to really hold the Kindle in the hands, but use as a stand, then this is also a great design and provides good stability. If you are going to throw your tablet about a lot (shudder!) or put it into a bag with sharp objects(more shuddering!), then go with the official case. Otherwise stick with the Moko- I got two in blue plus black, and am returning the overpriced (IMHO) official case.

$review_text.: I got these to make some custom cables (obviously).  I was using RG6 quad shield, and it's a real challenge to shove these things into the cable.  I have the Paladin compression tool and new flaring tool / reamer, but I still end up with about a 30% failure rate where the connector shoves the outer insulation down instead of sliding over and getting a good compression seal.  I'm going to try some regular RG6 to see if the thinner insulation and reduced amount of shielding (just one layer of wire and one of foil) makes it easier to more reliably crimp these on.  Hopefully it will.Now, that problem isn't technically the fault of the connectors - it'd be true of any connector like this.  I don't have the issue with F connectors, since I can thread those onto another tool and really push them down; these are just hard to grab and shove onto quad shield.  But the connectors themselves are of a high quality.  The ring grips tightly, the pin fits snugly, and I'm confident that they are connecting the the female RCA jack solidly.  If you get them on right, you will not be able to pull them off of the cable.The color rings that come with the package are little colored rubber-ish o-rings which slide over the cable before you crimp the end on.  If I remember correctly, there are 2 yellows, 2 each of red, green, and blue, and 2 more of the red and 4 white.  So, with 10 ends in the package, you could do 5 cables - 3 component video and 2 audio.  Or a composite video cable and 4 audios.  Assuming you don't screw any ends up. :)Note that these are identical to the ones sold at Home Depot under a different name, "gator cable" or something like that.  Amazon has a better price if you can wait a day or two for shipping.

$review_text.: I love this SanDisk USB flash drive, though the first time I inserted it into a USB port, it was a bit tight going in.The package says it is compatible with both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, though I'm not sure if that means that it runs at 3.0 speeds. (I suspect it just means that it can be plugged into a USB 3.0 port, but will run at 2.0 speeds.)As I write this, my desktop is copying 24 GB of data to this flash drive, and it estimates that it will take eleven hours. Wow!!!Later, I'll try the same thing with another flash drive, then I will cut down the rating of the one that is slower.

$review_text.: This a complete edit to my previous review:When this machine worked, it was great.  Awesome picture and sound quality.  However, I was in contact with Marantz several times about this unit and I was not impressed.  The first phone call (first month of ownership) was brought on because the unit liked to freeze up during streaming or when exiting NetFlix in particular.  I did a full reset on the machine and it got better, not perfect but better.A few weeks later I have more issues.  If I had a Blu-Ray already in the machine and I turn it on, it would auto start the disc.  The UD5007 would sometimes respond to the remote/faceplate commands to STOP.  several times it would just keep on going at just not respond to the remote or faceplate.  I would have to shut the unit back down and restart and hope it would respond this time.Yesterday was the deal breaker.  I put in a brand new CD (BB King Live in Japan), sounded very distorted and started to skip around...  I figure it's the new CD that's the problem.  I bring it upstairs to another CD player and it plays fine, bring it to my car and it plays fin, put it back in the Marantz and it plays fine this time.  Swapped CD's to John Lee Hooker's Serve You Right to Suffer and it does the same distorted thing.  It was acting WAY to similar to my old Marantz DV7600 that had nonstop issues.I call Marantz this morning and they tell me to ship the unit (my dime) and wait to have it fixed (could not tell me how long it would take).  This is a two month old player and I'm expected to pay to ship it in and wait for who knows how long?maybe I'm demanding but I did not agree to this at all.  I watch nearly EVERYTHING through this player and being with nothing is not really an option.  I explain my situation and ask them to please ship me a NEW unit with a return label.  I'm told NOPE.  I ask to speak to a manager, still NOPE.This is a 2 month old $600 player that works FAR worse than my buddies 2 year old $80 LG player and I'm getting a "deal with it" attitude from Marantz?  Again, maybe I expect too much but as the consumer I expect better customer service when I shell out for a higher end product.My retailer has far better customer service.  They understood the issue and took the unit back for a full refund despite it being over the return policy time frame.  They could not believe how Marantz handled this situation.I've decided to go with the Oppo BDP-103 bundled with the ROKU stick.  I did prefer the UD5007 for music, but I MUCH prefer a machine that works.  So I'm borrowing a buddies PS3 to get me by till my new Oppo gets to me.

$REVIEW.: The good: Remote control beats the competition. Big bright display. Easy to navigate. Easy to add channels through web or from unit. Pretty good sound. I like the progress bar when you switch channels. Compact.  Ability to use a wired connection.The bad: My line of sight between unit and router was blocked by a refrigerator and corner wall and microwave. So I could not wirelessly connect without many problems. This may be true of all internet radios where you need a good line of site. I was expecting the same connectivity as my laptop, but that was not the case.I run a wired connection now from my router to the kitchen to the back of the unit. The result is that I now NEVER get slow buffering, failed connections or weak signals, or have to cycle on and off.  So the wired connection works flawlessly.I use external speakers also. I am now happy with the unit and will now dump my XM radio subscription for the home.

I use it in a home media computer which is a couple rooms and a floor away from the modem, but it manages to connect and stay connected and actually works fast. I get 30mbps on speed test when I'm paying for 50, and I usually get between 40 and 45 on Ethernet so I think that's good. The rubber on the bottom of the antenna makes it easy to put most places and it won't slide around, which is always a plus.

$review_text.: Very good motherboard for a very good price


I was upgrading the RAID-5 array in my media server (from 4 x 500GB to 4 x 1.5TB), but it turns out my old Asus P5D motherboard's ICH7R RAID controller could only support a 2TB volume size, so I needed a motherboard with a newer RAID chipset
This motherboard includes an ICH10R controller (now called the Series 4 by Intel)
The LGA 775 socket allowed me to transfer my old Pentium D 820 to this motherboard, but when a Q6600 came available from another system, I dropped that in instead.I have 2 x 1024 DIMM's and 2 x 2048 DIMM's for a total of 6GB RAM
Note that due to some stability issues, Corsair (the memory manufacturer) had me increase the voltage to the memory and the memory controller


They said that was because they design the memory for 2-stick installation, and the 4 sticks draw more power
The increase solved my stability issues.Because I now had 6GB of RAM (I only had 2GB before), I needed to go to a 64-bit O/S
Windows 7 x64 installed perfectly with no additional drivers needed


That was sweet.Because of the stability issues, I haven't overclocked yet
To tell the truth, it's a media and data server, and I really don't want any data corruption, so even if I do overclock this puppy, I won't be aggressive.The only issue I have with the motherboard is the substandard video controller


If you get this motherboard, I suggest you also get a nice $75 video card with 1GB of RAM - that'll let you run Aero, and your performance will be better.

My power supply, the same model but 1000 watts, stopped working when I installed a new graphics card which seems non-working.  I wanted to use this supply while my 1000 watt psu is repaired by Antec.  But this supply also did not work.  I received RMA authority from Antec and returned both supplies.  I paid for shipping them to Antec.  Antec repaired the supplies by sending me 2 1000 watt supplies at no cost to me.  I installed one and am using the computer to write this review.  The other will go into my AmigaOne X 1000 when I receive the motherboard.I have found Antec PSU's to be high quality backed by the highest level of service.  I recommend their products without reservation and use their cases and PSU's in all computers that I build.

$review_text.: Update after a month:(6-2-06) XM setup on this unit was a real pain

 I have 2 other XM radios so tried to add this one to my account online

 No go, you have to call to activate this

 Which means they charge you a $14.99 activation fee


 It is $5 less online and sometimes they don't even charge it


 Calling XM is an exercise in frustrating voice response menus, which won't let you activate the traffic service anyway

 So just cut to the chase and say "Operator" loudly several times at the outset and save yourself some time and aggravation


 It took 2 days and 3 calls to get the radio activated and working.Secondly, do yourself a favor and toss the card about the 3 "free" audible.com ebook downloads

 First of all you have to give them your cc info
 Then you don't get 3 ebooks

 You only get one real ebook


 You get one credit and many books are more than one credit!  They also "give" you a 30 minute speech by some guy, whoopie doo
 So you get 2 downloads
 They also don't tell you you have to download their player even to download anything

 I figured that out finally after 5 tries


 The player has crashed twice, I've heard 5 minutes of audio

 If you actually want to transfer the ebooks to the 2730, you need to hook the unit up to the PC, and make sure the pc's connected to the internet
 It's all too spywareish for my tastes

 I cancelled it immediately but I regret ever signing up for the service.I am very pleased with the gps
 The routing is good and screen is bright and has nice graphics
 I did not think I'd like the 3d view but I do, very much

 You can add your own points of interest which I have had to do a lot....this area is growing so rapidly that many things are missing from the database


 The traffic function of the XM radio is fantastic, unfortunately the coverage is very limited


 Only 2 roads in my county have any coverage and it is only a few miles of each.I love the MP3 player, and the remote is extremely handy
 The XM radio is not nearly as full-featured as my old unit

 I am used to being able to punch in the channel number, you can't do that on this unit

 The other thing I *really* miss is the "favorite song" feature on my old XM radio (where it alerts you if a favorite song is playing on another channel) and that is not available on this unit


 The FM transmitter is a lot weaker than my old XM one also, I often have static problems

 I do live in the DC area but I had no trouble with the old radio

 I really wanted the MP3, traffic and weather features, I just didn't expect the XM radio to be so disappointing.



$SUMMARY.: Unit good, XM and Audible Player not as good.

$REVIEW.: Please pay attention, this is not the same as the $15 AC Adapters you see on Amazon, I actually have ordered 3 of those already and had horrible results


 The $15 adapters use a cheap plastic box with a socket as an insert


 With this one for $25, it's MOLDED in

 Yes they spent the extra $5 in tooling and is charging us $25 for it, but the quality is so much better and still cheaper than the Canon ac adapter for $70


 The name brand of this one is Power 2000 and is almost twice the price of the cheapie, but when it comes to reliability, it's well worth it

 I may change my review to 5 stars if it last me more than a month

 That would be a victory in and unto itself
 Lastly, the Power 2000 is well worth the $25 they are asking, but still not a rock solid
 I don't think anything out there exists.

$REVIEW.: I had the Belkin Pre-N router for over a year.  I always had problems with it.  It would not stay connected and needed to be rebooted all the time.  Belkin said it was my ISP, then they said it was interference, etc., etc.Finally after a year of this, I decided to try this router.  Figuring if it was my ISP or interference, I could always send it back.The installation took 5 minutes and I have not had a problem since.  The Belkin now sits in the corner waiting for me to trash it.BTW - If you get a Linksys pre-N adapter too, you will get some great speeds.  I get up to 170 Mbps with the notebook one.

As I was deciding whether or not to order this it bounced around from Prime to not Prime and when I finally pulled the trigger it was not Prime and was coming from somewhere in Asia. Needless to say it took over a month to receive this thing.  Minutes after ordering, one was listed as prime at the same price.  I don't know how Amazon operates so just be careful...

 Can't comment on the surge protection part and hope to never have to
 The 90 degree wall plug is great

 One of the best features of this unit

 For your electronics, I advise to go with a reputable company

 This company has earned a name for itself and you can't go wrong with purchases from this company
The spacing of the plugs are good and will accommodate many different styles of plugs for your equipment


 Highly recommend


Of course, No direct lighting strike (surge) will be stopped by this unit or any unit on the market, but for normal power surges, I believe this unit is up to the task.

I freaked out when I ran out of these handy things and had to get some more.They're great for organizing the mess behind your TV and to keep wires from tangling up near your computer.It's also great for bundling loose wires/cords that come with all your electronic devices.These are relatively short so if you have thick wires (like the power cord to your TV or surge protectors - it's best to use 2 together). These are great to have handy around the home and way better than zipties since you can reuse all the time.

$review_text.: Been using this for about 6 or 7 months with no problems. I work in IT, and as soon as I heard that there was a monthly equipment rental fee for the Comcast modem, I thought &#34;...Why? How is it any different from any other modem?&#34; When I asked Comcast if I could just buy my own, they said no. I looked online and saw a lot of people did though. I ordered this one, figuring I could return it if they truly wouldn't let me use it. I hooked it up and called them, told them I bought my own, and they activated everything on their side for me. Later on, I found a page on their website that lists compatible modems. So, moral of this story, if someone from Comcast says you can't get your own modem... they're wrong. Do it anyhow and save some cash. It seems like they 100% allow it, but just don't like to admit it at first. After all, they make a lot more money if you rent the equipment from them.

Plus the  camera is setup to turn on when motion is detected and send a series of email pictures to me.  It's a nice feature but BEWARE since the camera has a tendency to false alarm when light levels change.  Despite sensitivity adjustments in the software I have yet to be able to resolve this issue.

$review_text.: I purchased this tablet when it went on sale for $250.00.  The new model is coming out  Thinkpad 10 this month with Baytrail....(around $800)  but I decided to go ahead and try this tablet out while waiting for the new model.  I was also considering the  Fujistu q584, Lenovo Thinkpad 10 , and the Surface Pro 3.My 3 main factors on deciding on the tablet were--  1.  Size/Weight  2. Battery Life  3. Price.Very impressed.  Looks great... very lightweight and the screen size is perfect. the overall quality built is very nice.I purchased the  Bluetooth keyboard, a 64 gb microsd card,  the dock and a case....  they all work great together.I updated to Windows 8.1  no problem.  it did take several hours... but not sure if it was my internet connection  or just the overall process to install and upgrade.I leave the dock + charger at the office.  When I go home for the day.. I only carry the tablet in the case ...  No need to carry a 3lb laptop... charger...etc.  I keep the Bluetooth keyboard at home....  and at the office I use a full size BT keyboard.Performance---  battery life is amazing.  My biggest question mark was.. how will this processor work for my daily tasks.  My typical normally use for work is--- excel, outlook, onenote, word, pdf and the web.  I don't use photoshop or any other heavy programs that would require extra processing power.  Overall  the programs and apps are working great.  Some programs are super fast... and some programs seem to be slower--- but in no way does it my overall ability to do work.  Sure  Baytrail or even Surface 3 (icore chips) will be much faster...  but wasn't interested in dropping $1k-$1.5k  on tablet....When visiting customers--- I use onenote  and have access to all my files directly there in front of the customer.  The pen works very well... great also for writing on pdf files.....Memory-  64 GB is low... but I purchased a 64 GB microsd card --- ( I would have purchased a 128GB card..but wasn't 100% sure it would work....)  this is only think right now im somewhat concerned with.  im using MS office and ondrive, I have dropbox... and I don't plan on keeping any music or photos on this tablet--- so I think I should be fine.this tablet is my daily workhorse and I have no need for a laptop.  Maybe down the road ill upgrade to the Thinkpad 10.... but for now.. I don't see a need.... this is working perfect.I strongly recommend this to anyone that looking to for something mobile & light and not looking to break the bank.
$SUMMARY.: Very Solid.

Everything in the package is cheaply made

I like that the silicone cover gives me more of a grip on my ipod, as I have a tendency to drop things
The belt loop is cheap


My last belt clip for my previous ipod was more secure


This belt clip results in my ipod hitting my hip much more when I run

Still, I gave the product overall 3 stars because you get what you pay for, and for the price I paid, I expected as much


It'll do for now.

$review_text.: I have purchased two pairs of binoculars from Amazon on Gold Box deals within the past year, the Celestron Outland X and the Vanguard Endeavor. The two are very similar in design and features, enabling a direct comparison. In all features the Vanguard is superior: the smoothness and precision of the adjustment mechanisms (main focus, individual right-eye focus, inter-pupillary distance, the ease and precision of adjustment of the twist-up eyecups), image-edge sharpness, and the quality of the carrying strap and the case. The Celestron&#8217;s right-eye adjustment is particularly stiff and hard to use. So how do the Celestron binoculars rate five-stars? I paid exactly one-quarter as much for them as I did for the Vanguards. In this lowest price bracket for quality binoculars I have 5 pairs from a variety of manufacturers, and the Celestrons are the best I have owned. Celestron also makes binoculars in the higher price ranges, but these Outland X models are worth considering as a good choice in a modest price range.

$review_text.: MyEmerson Dual Alarm Clock Radio Amfm Smartsetgave up the ghost after a recent power outage. It was the second one in about two years, so I decided it was time to go with a device with more staying power. Given the number of iXXX devices around the house, I wanted one that would function as a dock, and I didn't want to spend the money on anotherCambridge SoundWorks i755 Table Radio with iPod Dock(given the iffy quality and radio reception on that unit). Based on Amazon reviews, I bought this stylish dock.The dual docking feature is wonderful and it docks both iPad and iPhone perfectly. The sound quality from both iPod playback and the radio is glorious. On those scores, this dock rocks.Operating the clock, though, is a pain in the ass. The faux iPod controls are impossible to figure out and the remote is extremely cheesy (and that's all I need: another remote!). Finally, the one thing I *loved* about my old Emerson was the huge, easy to read clock numbers. The front display on this "clock" are invisible except head-on and close up. If you keep your clock next to your bed, this is probably fine. My clock is across the room (at the foot of the bed), though, and impossible to see.The alarm functions works fine and can choose between beeping, radio, or either iPod port. The "gradual wakeup" is a little on the jarring side (it starts too high and rises rapidly to "alert the neighborhood" volume).Philips does make a much simpler dock with bright numbers that I probably should have bought, but I'm generally happy with this dock for music playback, especially as it pulls FM in clearly and plays glorious sound. I will probably replace it as a clock though.

$REVIEW.: This is a very nice case for the Lenovo A1000 7"; tablet.  One of the only offered currently.  The tablet will not fall out but does have a little movement inside the holder causing the charge/data port to be partially blocked. This normally happens when held horizontally but is easy to push back into place.  Well made with business card and micro SD slots built in, an elastic strap to hold the case closed when not in use, and an elastic holder for a stylus pen.  When propped into the horizontal position it does not lock in place and stay very well.  Has a tendency to fall down flat.  Works good on stable solid surface.Update: I've had this case for almost a month.  This case is holding up good but the tablet moving inside the case when in the horizontal position is very annoying.  The weight of the tablet rests on the flap that is folded in between the back of the tablet and inside case back to hold it in place. This slowly falls down leaving the charge port and the bottom edge of the tablet partially covered.  When plugged in it falls at an angle due to the charge plug supporting the left hand side. The tablet is still usable in this position but I'm concerned it will damage the charge port when plugged in while resting horizontally.

$review_text.: I hadn't been in the market for USB->Serial for some time.  I had been quite happy with the Keyspan product. I have the HS-19 and USA=49WG four port models.  They worked great until I updated to Win7 64 Bit.  They worked great under Win7/32.  Suddenly, I was chasing BSOD (Blue Screen of Death).  After finding that the Keyspan drivers were the culprit, I went to get new drivers.  Keyspan has been acquired by Tripp Lite. They list the drivers as supporting Win7/64 - but they don't.. The driver date is 2007 - well before Windows 7.  So.. time to change.I heard that FTDI had great support.  I really wanted a four port device, with female receptacles.  This two-port cabled device was as close as I could get.  So I do have a bit more of a cable mess than with Keyspan 49, the BSOD is gone.The software is intuitive and integrated into Win7.  I have two of these devices (4 ports total).  They have serial numbers built in.  So, when I move them around to different USB ports, they always come up with the same COM number.  Not all drivers do this. Some report a different com port when plugged into a different USB port.  It is much nicer to be able to label each of the connectors as COMxx instead of having to go to device manager each time I power up.I am using 115,200 bps, but plan to move to faster speeds as I qualify my embedded device.

It splits the pairs on top and bottom instead of all the pairs punched down in the same row (like in the picture).  Blue and Brown punch down on top.  Orange and Green punch down on bottom.  I would think this creates unneeded stress on the cable since they are split apart like that.  It will also make it harder to feed cable in the built in cable management hooks in the back.This is not what I wanted.

$review_text.: Read other reviewers with same problem and buy with forewarning.I was really enjoying this. Using it at work, connected to my pc, streaming music from my own collection in the cloud, Spotify, Amazon, Pandora. Definitely a noticeable improvement in clarity, staging, dynamics. A little bit confusing on the user interface, but enjoyed having control over gain, bass, treble and volume. This device really was what I wanted at a very reasonable price.Six months after owning it, the left channel started emitting a static noise upon startup, but went away when music was played. I lived with that until two weeks later, only static through both channels. Clearly the device has quality issues, very disappointing in a world where electronics rarely melt down like this one, in so short a period of use. Yes there is a one year warranty, but return to China for repair is not a serious option - this company has no US office.

$REVIEW.: I run two of these exact model cards in crossfire in my setup which consist of a 4770k i7 Haswell CPU, sabertooth z87 motherboard, and of course these two MSI hd 7970's.Having tested crossfire with both cards using application profiles and beta drivers I can say that crossfire works without any trouble. It recognized both cards after starting up and offered to enable crossfire and I have yet to experience any oddities that are sometimes blamed on the paring of cards. I've also yet to find a single game that can tax even one of these cards let alone both, its more for future proofing as I'm currently using a lower quality 1440x900 monitor which I know this setup is overkill for but I believe this would be great for high resolution gaming with the 3GBs of VRAM that they have.I can also say that these cards love the battlefield games, while playing the battlefield 4 beta with one card I could play at the highest setting and average 77fps @ 1440x900 with both cards my average was over 120fps and was more then acquitte for this game.Using one of these cards allowed me to play crysis 3 on the highest setting with AA off at 1440x900 and stay around 50fps but would drop below 30 on occasion with AA maxed as well. With both cards this issue was solved and it never dips below 60 fps and stays more around 110 on average.In most real world scenarios aside from enthusiasts a single card will suffice for even hard core gaming but two just takes it to a new level.As for what MSI brings to the table, they overclock great I've got both running 1180mhz by 1400mhz memory and its completely stable and never goes about 60C for the second card and 70c for the first card (second card blocks some airflow from the first). They are also very quite until you hit about 60% fan but at the temperature they stay at vs fan noise they perform better with the twin forzr III cooler then any of the other brands I have have used such as XFX. MSI also has a nice design to their cards that make them look better built and designed, as well as using solid capacitors and having a great warranty, that is why I chose this model vs the competition.

$review_text.: I have been using a Rebel XTi for the last 5 years and I loved it. I've been ready to upgrade for a while and thought to get the T3i, but decided to hold out for this update. I was getting a little frustrated by the limitations of my outdated model, specifically the high noise and low ISO range. The new Digic 5 chip in the T4i is incredible. I am blown away at how better and more accurate this camera is at focusing, metering, and the insanely improved noise reduction. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to upgrade, but not ready to make the $2K+ plunge into the 5D realm.I've been using this for a few weeks and here's my take so far:-Much welcomed high ISO range with very good noise control.-The battery life is much improved. I'm kind of shocked, actually. I've taken 2000+ pictures, a few with flash, and several (usually battery-killing) long (10-300 sec) exposures, still on all three bars.-The night scene modes and noise reduction modes are GREAT.-The HDR mode is cool but I've notice the camera isn't as good as software (such as Photomatix) at blending the pictuers, specifically when it comes to ghosting and mainting edge-contrast integrity. This mode is also limited on customizeability of the toning/fusion process as compared to HDR software.-The touch screen and swivel movement are incredible. You can take shots that were otherwise impossible to get, such as the camera being above your head or low to the ground. Focusing on any point with touch is also great.-The video quality is superb, but I'm not really in the video shooting business. It's just fun to have.-I only bought the body, and would recommend this to anyone who can afford to not have the kit lense, despite it's conveneint wide focal range. There are much, much better lenses out there. Even the $100 fixed 50mm is night and day to the kit lens.Overall, I'm smitten with this camera. Canon knocked it out of the park. I wish I could've been patient for the price to drop a little, but I'm very glad I have it right now.

$REVIEW.: I got this little guy for Christmas and although it was not exactly what I was looking for, after using it a few days, this frame really charmed me. I was originally looking for a frame that I could load a large amount of photos into and play on a constant slide show. The Pulse only has a half GB of memory so it doesn't hold a huge photo album, but it has some other features that quickly won me over.The Pros:+By registering with KodakPulse.com you can create an email account which will let friends and family email photos directly to the frame.+ Sync it with Facebook or twitter and when you or your friends update their photos, your Pulse will receive the new photos automatically.+ WiFi Range is surprisingly good.+Collage setting looks great for displaying multiple photos at a time.+ Use your online setup options at kodakpulse.com to program your frame to turn on and off at specific times of the day so that you aren't wasting energy displaying photos when no one is home.The Cons:-The unit is a bit short on memory which is a problem if you have a large photo album to display.-the touch screen is not as responsive as I would like (I often have to press options more than once or use more finger pressure then should be necessary- Frame has a lot of features, but most are only accessible with the kodakpulse.com account. It would be nice to have more functionality directly from the frame itself. For example deleting one picture from the frame is easy, but deleting multiple pictures is tedious unless you do it from the Kodak website. Also using  the engergystar features is only available from the website which is annoying.Summary:If you are looking for a frame that you can load a ton of pictures into then set it and forget it then this is probably not the frame for you. The charm of the Pulse is that with some limited setup online, this frame will constantly update new pictures providing you with a daily stream of new photos. Every day I come home to new pictures which is a fun new way to use a picture frame.I rate it 4 out of 5 stars but would have given it 5 stars if the memory was larger, the other cons i mentioned are minor inconveniences and only bothersome on the initial setup.

I bought it from Amazon; I I would return it but as it an intelligent product ( such as software, book) so I keep it. The online video show you how to fold the paper, then the rest just as at the focuspyramid website. The pictures at the website is so small that I could not see the different between them.In the Canon 5d II recommend to leave micro adjustment alone unless you really need it, and Canon is right. After I spent over 2 hours to calibrate all of my  5 lenses, I have to reset 4 of them to original setting. The only lens I find the improvement is canon 50mm EF ($100 plastic lens).

$review_text.: I needed storage for my new PDA, a Dell Axim 50v.  I specifically went with an Axim because of the CF-II slot, knowing a microDrive would give me at least 4Gb of storage.  Well, as things tend to improve over time, so did the storage capacity of these little babies.  I took a plunge on the 6Gb model.Now, a quick note about microDrives.  If you intend to use one in a digital camera or PDA, you need a retail microDrive.  The OEM ones or the ones harvested from MP3 players like the Creative Muvo2 or Rio Carbon are ROM masked to IDE mode.  In short, they won't work in your PDA or digital camera, no matter how hard you hack.  You either have to wait for the PDA's operating system to support IDE transfers on CompactFlash (and Microsoft's Windows Mobile 5 purports to do exactly this), or go retail.I went retail, of course, getting the full manufacturer's warranty and the security of knowing it would work... and it sure did.  5.71Gb instantly seen (6Gb is the raw, unformatted number), and about twenty minutes later (slow external card reader), I had filled it with 600 songs.I've been using it with my Axim for a few days now, and it's everything I expected.  No problems this far, and it's a great feeling having a PDA that exceeds the Palm's hot new LifeDrive, for about $50 less.-Fred

$review_text.: I managed to pick up an open box S580 at Best Buy the same week it was released. More on that towards the end...I've based my opinion of this Sony S580 compared to Samsung's 2010 top of the lineBD-C7900-- the player with two HDMI outputs. That was (briefly) my first Hi-Def DVD player, after our six year-oldSony 5-disc carouselbegan spitting discs. But I couldn't help it -- I returned the Samsung shortly after seeing Sony's S580 coming out at $100 less than what I paid for the open box Samsung.I was hoping Sony had stepped up their game with respect to the on-screen interface and Netflix queue. Unfortunately, not: Sony's menu system on the S580 is pretty staid, the straight-forward line-by-line menus close to what they were offering on last year's x70 models. Back also is the unsortable grid layout Netflix queue. This is a big contrast to Samsung's flashier menus with expanding menu icons (ala Apple's taskbar on OS X) and a more dynamic Netflix selection page (though it, too, is more flash than substance and leaves a lot to be desired). Oh, and Sony's remote is horrible for entering text, for instance when searching for a video on YouTube.But the Sony's nuts and bolts are all tight: The Sony "feel" is more substantial than the feather-light Samsung. It's got four goofy yet functional, no-nonsense little match-head buttons, not the sleek buttonless, LED-backlit touch sensitive panel of the Samsung. Both players start up within seconds. Sony's got a boring, compact remote but it feels well built and comfortable, not Fisher-Price like Samsung's. And there's something about Sony's tray opening and closing that just feels like it's able to put up with some abuse, and will be around for a while.Basically for me it came down to this tired old summary: I'd date the Samsung, but marry the Sony.Sony setup was a breeze, Bluray playback has been uneventful, SD playback is super cleaned-up so no complaints of the upscaling (thought it's obviously not comparable to BluRay quality), can't comment on 3D yet since I'm still waiting on my TV, Pandora works great for just playing in the background, and YouTube videos are actually watchable (but entering search queries is a slow pain in the kiester). The player is dead quiet -- little whisper of a wind up whine, but basically silent once it gets going. Wireless networking is finally built in (not a dongle), and the connection to my home PC happened with the click of a (remote) button.Amazon's house brand HDMI cablesare working without a hitch, but again, I've yet to play 3D content with them.Now, the cautionary part. I bought mine open box, and whoever had it before me registered NetFlix. I was stuck with their Dora the Explorer-themed queue, and it actually takes a call to NetFlix to deregister it. Can't just hit the reset button. And, believe it or not, NetFlix doesn't do customer support stuff like this over email (at least, that's what I was able to decipher -- I hope I'm wrong, but don't think so). So if you're planning on grabbing one of these as a return from Amazon's WarehouseDeals.com, just expect a little extra difficulty getting up and running.Samsung has a whole slew of their really sexy, beautiful 2011 'D'-series players coming out now and in the next couple months, but I just feel more confident with this (relatively) solid feeling Sony player sitting on the shelf. Sony's user interface may be a little conservative and lack pizazz,  but Samsung's flashiness is already getting knocked for Netflix bugs and promised operating system updates.Edit 4/7: After talking a little smack about the 2010 Samsung players, and seeing the Sony S580 price dip to the $150 price point, I (1) returned my $200 open-box S580 to Best Buy due mainly to the Netflix issue I mentioned with the intention of buying a sealed unit from Amazon, but then (2) had the opportunity to check out Samsung's 2011 units. I ended up purchasing a 2011 Samsung BD-D6700 from Amazon... I wrote a bunch about this decision (and the ordeal surrounding this seemingly simple DVD player purchase) below, in the comments to this review, in response to Ty Harden's (largely justified) criticism of my inability to make up my mind. It may be worth your time to read, especially if you're thinking of upgrading just the DVD player but using an older TV or receiver.

$review_text.: We have our HF and a regular DirecTV receiver in our media room with RF run by cables from there to TVs in our great room, two bedrooms and a craft room. The remote reviewed here is RF so its signal goes through walls to a little IR transmitter pointed at the normal DirecTV receiver in the media room closet. We can carry the remote around the house, or we could have bought two or more, to control the channel on the non-HD TVs. I send the DirecTV signal around the house on channel 3, a DVD player on channel 66 and a VHS player on channel 77.I titled this review "Replacement" because an identical one broke when dropped after five years good service. Teaching the remote from the DirecTV remote is very easy.

The unit is not very sturdy IF you want to mount any video monitors on it. This is a problem with the GM cup holder and not this unit. If your car has a decently made drink/cup holder this would be a great way to mount for a monitor-tablet-phone. As I am Now aware, this is a common complaint of these devices on Government Motors.  Just be aware before you purchase it for such older models.

$REVIEW.: I have had this Oppo unit for almost a year

I think there are tons of other reviews covering the great aspects of the unit: easy to use, great image quality, excellent sound, and so on


In this case, I would like to add some words about Customer Service.As most of the professional BD players, manufacturers, Oppo distributes firmware updates via the Internet for feature enhancements and bug fixes


With the last update, there was something wrong with my unit and it basically started to have a faulty operation
I send an email to Oppo and in matter of hours they respond with additional diagnostic questions and suggestions
After some other emails, they realized the problem was a serious one
There is where their excellent service started

I'm outside USA and most of the manufacturers have limitations in the service that they provide to international customers if they don't have local branches
Oppo don't change their standards with me

They send me a UPS label to send my unit free of charge; they even take care of the customs paperwork

My duties were reduced to pack and drop the unit on an UPS office near home
Once they received the unit, they fix it in ONE DAY and the next day the unit was on the road to my home
They documented what the fix and provide me with some extra goodies that may be of nominal value but a very nice touch.Why consider this an excellent service? I quoted the cost of sending the unit via the same services Oppo provided me for free

It represented to Oppo about the 50% of the selling price! I'm sure they lost money with me! Did they try to charge me for the shipping, partially or completely? NEVER.Tech issues always happened
What you do to correct these is what makes the difference
For me, Oppo not creates excellent players; they also cover their international customers with the same level of support as domestic customers


That said a lot of a company

I had a complain with my Bose HT system six months ago..

I'm still waiting for a decent response from them.My next BluRay will be Oppo..


OF COURSE!

$review_text.: I wanted a low-bulk cover for my four-year old Canon SX10 superzoom camera.  This one is a great value.  I already do well with a neoprene cover for my much more precious DSLR, so there was no reason not to get one for my aged-but-trusty compact.  This case allows me to pack the camera into a backpack or just keep it ready when I'm traveling or biking.  It probably won't protect the camera from the &#34;wrong&#34; drop, but I'm pretty careful.The one drawback is that the lens doesn't really &#34;fill&#34; the &#34;nose&#34; of the case, so it's &#34;floppy.&#34;  You'll also have to pack extra batteries somewhere else, but I'm OK with that, too.Others have dinged this product because the case is &#34;too small&#34; for the camera.  I'm used to neoprene cases in which you have to stretch the case around the camera.My case also came with a handy velcro &#34;hook&#34; piece around one of the fasteners so you can make it &#34;right&#34; handed or &#34;left&#34; handed.  I didn't expect that feature, and I like it, mostly for when I reverse the case inside out.  That way, the fastener stays on the side I want it.
$SUMMARY.: Product is just what I expected:  A lightweight, limited-padding cover for my Canon SX10

$review_text.: I bought this a while back and finally installed it...I'm impressed. This small antenna rocks. I have a satellite system and wanted an antenna to get the locals during the occasional outage so I gave it a shot.Assembly was simple, and I had a spare coax running to my set so I got in the attic, cut the cable, added a connector, hooked her up and hung it from a nail. Best over the air signal I've ever had. HD channels are crisp and clear and I get more locals than our satellite provider furnishes. It has one minor flaw, the included cable is cheap and useless. The connector came off when I attached it to the tv, but I had spare RG-6 to make my own.Overall, a great item and made in the USA.

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately, even though I'm less than 20 miles from the stations, I am unable to find a spot that can pick up nbc, abc, cbs and fox at the same time. This means I cannot mount the antenna nicely with the pins or velcro as I am required to constantly move it between different walls/windows depending on which channel I want to watch. I wish now that I'd paid the $40 more to try the amplified version to hopefully be able to find one spot that all channels can be seen and to reach the PBS tower which is 40 miles away. One more thing, even when I do get certain channels, the signal breaks every time a car drives past my house. I know this could all be solved by an attic antenna but I so rarely watch OTA tv it's not worth it for me.

$REVIEW.: I should confess that I'm not approaching this from a gaming point of view. My PT suggested that I ditch the laptop keyboard in favor of a real keyboard so I could control the height and give my neck a break. This works very well for traditional typing.The two ports are fine for a printer and a portable mouse. Based on the review, it should be durable: "Switches rated for over 50 million keystrokes." My kiddo does in fact use my computer for some games, and it's good to know that all the pounding she does won't shorten the life of my laptop.I can't say that I've noticed "fewer typing errors" (per the claim), but that's probably more about my (lack of) skills than the keyboard.  The lighting does make the keys easier to see.

$review_text.: Pros+  Very comfortable around ears+  Very comfortable in ear.+  No way these babies are coming off.+  Does not make my ears feel clogged like with rubber tip, in-ear headphones
 These block some outside noise, but don't completely isolate me from my environment, which is desirable for work, or outdoor exercise.Cons-  The in-line microphone is not good enough for phone calls


 I don't know what it sounds like, but no one can understand me when I try to use it.-  With my android phone, only the play/pause button works

 Volume controls do not work


 Still it's nice being able to pause.Neutral - Sound quality
 They sound just fine to me, but I've never had an expensive pair of headphones so what do I know.Conclusion:  If the microphone were better and all three buttons worked, this would be the perfect pair of headphones
 I seriously wish there were more headphones with this type of in-ear form factor


 Hopefully Sony will make an updated version some day.

$REVIEW.: What a difference a year makes.A little more than a year ago, Xtrememac came out with a wireless speaker system/ iPhone charger that enabled all Bluetooth devices to connect to it in a handsome bookshelf-style design.I was impressed more with the aesthetics than with the components.  The speaker system which was a compact version containing 6 speaker including tweeters and a woofer, left a lot to be desired audibly.The new "Tango Bar" is here and it appears that Xtrememac had been listening to its customers.  The Tango Bar is a dream piece of audio equipment for the mid-price range audio shopper.****  ******The most obvious thing about Xtrememac, one of the more prolific Apple-oriented accessory companies, is that their products are handsome, well-built, exterior designs.  Visually, a classy addition to any computer set-up.Xtrememac products are also, however, on the pricier side, and far exceeding their value when compared with like products that boast of more powerful components.But, they did something interesting this time around.  They kept the beautiful silver grey metal grill bar but they focused on the internals.  They've created an integrated system that can function as a peripheral to a computer (through a USB extension) as well as a universal peripheral to other audio equipment with a 3.5mm cable.Which means, you can replace a laptops speaker with this 6-speaker system that is considerably more robust than my MacBook Pro's internal speakers, for instance.  So, if you're taking your laptop in your travels, you have a fairly decent pair of speakers that will enhance most presentations. And, it's only 7"longer in length.****  ****I have a modest portable set-up in my home-art studio.  Consisting of a laptop with a pair of external JBL speakers, I've always been fairly happy with the audio results.  But, I had no idea what I was missing until I set this up for testing.I once had a pair of external speakers that relied on the computer's power source to function instead of an a/c current.  This resulted in a sound that was no different than the sound blasting from my laptop's internal speakers.  So, a friend gave me the wall powered JBL computer speakers that I've been using faithfully for the past 5 years.  When I saw the power input of the Tango Bar, I initially thought "here we go again."  Boy, was I surprised.You can also create, which is my preference, an extended (or a broader stereo sound) if you have a pair of a/c-powered speakers.  The setup is fairly simple:1) Tango Bar (USB) into the laptop/ desktop/ tablet USB slot.2) The external speakers 3.5mm jack is removed from the computer and placed into the Line-In input jack.3) System Preferences-Sound-Output4) "USB Sound Device" and adjust volume.This simple set gave me the effects of 10 speakers.  And, the sound is terrific.*** Conclusion ***The Xtrememac Tango Bar is a well-built and versatile speaker system that allows you to replace your computer's modest speakers with a much more robust audio speaker system.  It's also versatile enough to function as an extra pair of stereo speakers creating a fuller sound for movie and concert watching and it also has a sub-woofer input for bass-heavy fidelity.I really like what Xtrememac has done here and lastly, they've dropped the price from the $150 price range to around $85.  So, at this price range, they've got it right.5 stars.

$REVIEW.: These isolating headphones sound very good for the price.  They do not produce extremely deep bass, but that was to be expected.  The isolating ear buds are a bit to get used to when using voice over the iphone as there is a bit of echo (internal reverberation), which is cured by removing the left earbud.The build is solid around the jack and phones, however the wires are a bit on the thin side.  The remote push-button is rather large and easily pressed by mistake.  It also hangs very low (middle of the sternum) for those you accustom to the Iphone earbuds.All in all a nice pair of earbuds for the price and performance.

It came with no instructions,,just a photo, but my husband easily assembled it and saw how the latch worked. The Garmin just clicks on and off (once I got the knack) .We're surprised that even going over bumps, this heavy little mount really does stay securely placed on the edge of the dashboard exactly where we want it--so both the driver and  the &#34;navigator&#34; can see the GPS.  I can't imagine trying to place it so exactly using suction cups. The mount adjusts the Garmin up and down and sideways for the perfect viewing angle and to avoid glare, Then when i'm ready, I can just pick the mount right up and store or hide it.

$review_text.: EDIT #3: Back to a great review :)  While complaining on twitter about my projector, @OptomaUSA saw it and contacted me about fixing my projector
 Long story short, they fixed it at no cost to me, other than shipping it to them

 This was a great gesture considering the warranty had been out for 6 months

 I hope to get more than a year out of the replacement chip.EDIT #2: To be exact, I have 475 hours on this projector.EDIT:  Well, with just a little over a year on this projector and still the original bulb, I have in excess of 50 dead pixels on my screen

 Very disappointed with this projector and very hard to watch things with a constellation in your way

 Even at $500 for this projector, it's not worth it if it only lasts a year.PREVIOUS REVIEW:I bought this projector after my Dell 2300MP died an inexplicable death


 I really didn't think you could get a decent project for under $1k, but boy was I wrong

 The picture on this projector is great


 There is a little bit of detectable noise in the picture, but I'm not sure if it's because I'm feeding it from a 20ft long vga cable and not hdmi
 I plan on replacing the cable eventually with an HDMI one.I'm using this projector on a mythtv frontend

 It's running in 1280x800 mode (it's actual native resolution) and it displays HDTV perfectly


 It's quick to find the signal when turned on


 It's quick to turn off

 Although the picture displays quick, it takes a minute or two for the bulb to project in the right color cast


 Also, when first powered on, the fan is very noticeable, but once the picture stabilizes (1 minute or so), the fan speed kicks down and it's fairly quiet.My previous screen (for my Dell) was too small so I ended up smoothing out the wall and painting over it with white paint
 Even though it's not projecting on a proper screen, the colors are still great and the contrast is very good.So, if you want to have a good home theater and you really don't want to spend a lot of money, this projector should be on the top of your list.

this is in response to the previous review that stated the imac was sluggish and had the spinning wheel
the intel imacs run really slow if the memory isnt upgraded


the standard 512 barely makes email run smoothly

after adding an additional 1g of ram (for a total of 1.5g) everything runs great

it also helps to go for a faster broadband connection


after the memory upgrade (which i did myself for 99 dollars) i have only gotten the waiting wheel a handful of times in the past month.i must also stress that apple has great customer service and the reps all seem to speak english

$review_text.: Before I purchased this product I looked on the D-Link website to see if it was compatible with my Canon Pixma MX 310 all in one printer; my printer was not on the compatible list. Next I e-mailed D-Link tech support who said it may work even if not on the list. I hooked it all up and followed directions; computer saw the printer but it would not print. E-mail tech support said call telephone tech support. Telephone tech support is American, not outsourced--hurray. Telephone tech support then said "If your printer is not on the supported printer list I can't assist you, you're on your own".  Canon claims to have a Silex print server that supports all Canon PIXMA printers--we'll see.  Follow up: the Silex print server works as promised - took several calls to effective(American)tech support but it works.This printer / print server problem is disgusting; they sell hundreds of thousands of products, should have accurate, reliable, up to date info on compatibility.

$review_text.: I think these earbuds are very good sound-wise, but with two notable flaws.....First, here is what's in the box:* The earbuds* Small, medium and large size covers four sets of covers* Detachable clip for attaching the buds' wire to clothing etc.* Small pouch to store/carry the Woodees.From a strictly cosmetic sense, these are beautiful.  A nice wood finis with some design on them certainly sets them apart from your basic black, white, etc. earbuds.  For looks alone, I think they are a notch up on typical earbuds.Performance is very good.  Highs are clean and clear, midranges not distorted even at high volumes, and lows are good.  I didn't notice any weaknesses on bass like others mentioned.  I did find that these produced sound quality comparable to some much higher priced products.  I noticed instrument nuances and sounds I've not really noticed before on some songs even at very low volume.  I would rate these excellent for reproduction of sound.Now to the flaws: Two things kept these from being a 5 for me.....in fact, had the sound reproduction not been so wonderful and the looks so cool I might have rated this a 3 or said avoid them.One: other people in the room complained they could hear my music even on lower volumes and even if I used various ear bud covers for a snug fit and better seal against my ear.  I know these are not touted as noise canceling, but there seems to be an unusual amount of spillover of sound.  People sitting across the room could identify the songs I was listening to, etc.Second, the wire, while of typical and ample length and terminated in 24k gold, either isn't insulated or ??  You can touch the wiring while you are listing to music and hear the sound of you tapping on/touching the wire.  This prompted me to take these on a short jog.  Although there was no background noise from the wire moving along my shirt, if I so much as brushed my hand on the wire, that got picked up in the ear buds.These are not huge, huge deals, but enough to keep you from fully enjoying the buds to their full potential.  You won't be able to listen to them in a quiet setting without sharing your music, which others may not want.  And the noise from the "live" wire has got to go.Still, the sound quality was excellent otherwise, with no distortion, great highs and mids and good lows, and the wood is quite the conversation piece.  I would buy these if you can live with the flaws.

$REVIEW.: This is such an attractive case that its physical appearance is enough to sell thousands of these. Made of a synthetic material, it has a high end look to it that is artsy in a classic way. The artist/designer has taken her favorite places and used what I can rightly or wrongly describe as a fluid calligraphy font as her design feature. It's base color is a dark red that makes the font pop.The interior is sort of jazzy, too. Lined with a microfiber material that is black, it has a secure pocket to store notes, etc. on the right interior side. The left interior side is reserved for the Kindle Fire HD. There are four elastic anchors which secure the Kindle and keep it put without any slippage. The front cover and the interior lining are stitched securely in place and seems substantial and secure.My only criticisms is that I wish this had more interior padding and had a clasp or belt to keep it secure when it is in a purse or tote. While I have a high impact screen cover to protect it, I'd like to keep the Kindle from any potential marring or scuffing.Overall, this would be a five star product if not for the non-existent closure and thin cushion.

$REVIEW.: When I purchased this camera, I had a very specific set of features I was looking for:-A compact shape (Canon ELPH or similar, "pocket size")-A wide short-zoom end (28mm or less)-A short long-zoom end (~120mm or less preferably)-In-lens image stabilization (not a sensor shift model)-Aperture and shutter priority settings*- &lt;=$350 if possible*This was the kicker.  Finding a camera that was both compact, and had the aperture/shutter priority mode was extraordinarily difficult.  In fact the whole list of active (new) cameras I could find (at time of purchase) with all these features was 5 cameras!Canon PowerShot S95Canon PowerShot SD4000 ISPanasonic Lumix DMC-FX700Samsung TL350Samsung ST600To be honest, I know little about Panasonic/Samsung cameras, but have used Canons for a number of years.  So in my mind that only left the Canon S95 and SD4000.  The S95 was more expensive (~$400) and bulky than I was looking for, so all that was left was the SD4000.On the SD4000, the aperture/shutter controls are there, but they are buried deep in a couple menus.  In fact, there are decidedly few physical controls on this camera, so certain camera settings make take a number of button pushes.  Anyone who's familiar with older models of Powershoot or SD Canon cameras may find themselves frustrated by the increased menu-surfing.  All the usual features are there, you just have to go digging for them a bit harder.One glaring problem with this model appears to be its ability to focus in low-light (read: party) conditions.  I estimate this camera misses roughly 1/3 of all shots when shooting at room-to-low lighting, with close subjects, with the flash on, and using the focusing beam.  This is unacceptable.  I have owned several Canon compacts in the past (including a similar-design SD800), and none of them had this sort of difficulty in those conditions.  I actually returned the first SD4000 I purchased, thinking it was defective.  But the second one is just about as bad.  If you plan to use this camera for low-light subjects, I would suggest testing it out first.Otherwise, the performance seems very good.  When the camera does focus, the quality is good for a compact.  Canon's high-ISO, low-light work continues to impress.  I love the wide end zoom (28mm) and wide aperture setting (f/2.0).  Be prepared, of course, for very high barrel distortion at the wide-end, which is common with compacts like this.Battery life seems decent.  Buy a spare.  Flash seems kinda weak but adequate.  There are some neat functions that are new to Canon compacts, such as a high-speed (low res) video mode, which would be neat for sports or maybe macro photography.So then, this is a somewhat-unique camera option, a cheaper-end compact that offers nearly full manual controls. Just be aware of the low-light focusing issue.

If you want to get one of these just to place on your coffee table so everyone can play with it, 'fly it' and twist the selector back and fourth to 'fire laser cannons', this is the thing to get.  After serving in this capacity for about a month, I hooked it up to my sound system, and found that is works every bit as well in it's designed environment.  So, if you are looking for a good, functional, optical switch, this is it.  And if you need a toy, conversation piece, or futuristic nicknack, this is it too.

$review_text.: The slider is more cumbersome then it should be. At around 3.75lbs and with it's high profile, the slider may leave you wishing you got something more portable.The sliding "bearings" are made of this smooth rectangular plastic that supposedly lubricates the rails. I like that the sliding rails are tucked away in the the aluminum bar (so they're not easily dented), but the slider motion is not as smooth as I would have liked. Sometimes a slide would look perfect through the LCD screen, but when you view it on a larger monitor, the sticking points in the slider are very obvious. It's possible to get nice slides, but you have to be extra careful, and have a lot of patience during your slide for it to be smooth.The bottom has four 1/4" 20 mounting options. The unique design lets you adjust where you want to attach 1/4" 20's along the entire bar.The legs provide stability, but if you are on very uneven terrain, they are pretty much useless because they only adjust half an inch or so.The carriage is very bulky, but is easily removed when you remove the end cover by  unscrewing a thumb screw at the end of the slider (be careful, the screw can fall out of the cover). Once you remove the carriage, you'll find that the 3/8" (1/4" is also provided) bolt will also fall right out of the carriage. It doesn't have a d-ring on it, so you'll need a coin or flathead screw driver to tighten it to your camera. But because of the carriage design, getting a coin in there is very difficult. So you're stuck with using a flathead.Using a fluid head on the carriage probably won't work because you already have to be extra careful while sliding, so I don't image an additional tilt/pan would make it any easier to produce something smooth. So you're stuck with a ball head (which is all right for 90% of the time).Even for a basic slider, I can't say this is worth your money. For $20 dollars more I'd buy theGlide Gear DEV 470 Video Camera Track Slider 47" Adjustable Feet. Plus, with the Glide Gear you get a very necessary carrying case, which this Motion Slider does not come with. Keep in mind though, that I have not used the Glide Gear--it's just what I would buy if I were limited to $200.Search youtube for: "blunty glider gear dev 235" if you want to see the shorter version in action.If you keep the camera weight balanced over the carriage (with a macro slider or adjustable quick release system), then you'll probably get good results like in the video. You still probably won't be able to use a fluid head though. For that you should get a Konova K2--like I did.

$REVIEW.: It is big, heavy, and awesome!  If you are considering this lens you have probably been inspired by its sharpness or its photographic speed (f2.8).  Less obvious is its operational speed; it focuses incredibly fast and silently.Night performance:  Astounding.  See the photo of trees and stars in the user gallery.Its mass actually helps stabilize the camera, so I don't use my monopod nearly as often as I used to.  It has become my number one lens mounted most of the time.Don't break your lens hood trying to get it off.  There's a pushbutton to unlock it.  No more inadvertent vignetting because your petal-hood has rotated by itself.I hate fuzzy lenses and fuzzy edges.  If I take a photo of a group of people, I want the people on the edges to be as sharp as the ones in the middle, and they want it too.  This lens works.My lens is as perfectly rectilinear at widest angle as I can detect. Its geometry is much better than any of my other zoom lenses and maybe even better than my 28mm prime; though of course, a 28mm prime lens is tiny compared to this beast.

Like someone else mentioned I was skeptical because of the tiny size. It's about the diameter of a can of red bull. I'm planning on using it to run video loops and casual listening to internet radio while working.  If I wanted to do audio editing I'd use a set of monitors.  I love the fact that it is rechargable.  I don't have to burn through batteries.  It really is suprisingly loud with a decent sound field.  I'm tempted to do a little haking to see if i can get too into a stereo setup.  For the price I've never heard something this good.  15 bucks or so...go for it.  Just don't think you're going to get earth shattering bass.  It's the size of a salt shaker for goodness sakes.  But it holds up great!
$SUMMARY.: Wow, Perfect for the right application.

$review_text.: PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT LINKSYS HAS BEEN SOLD TO ANOTHER COMPANY: I am of the opinion the sale will capitalize on the Linksys Name but produce lower quality routers; so if you use Linksys Routers, buy another one RIGHT now so you will have an original Linksys as a back-up.As I read the other reviews for the Linksys E2500 (aka, Cisco) I am amazed by the number of folks who don't like this router. Set-up is so easy, you can even allow the router to name your network for you (which I think is good idea for "prying-eyes"). Set-up really is a breeze. This is my fourth Linksys Router in the course of the last five years. I have never had a Linksys Router fail me, and I have only purchased new ones when an upgrade was justified. When my son needed a new router I gave him one of my older, used routers and he was "up and running" in no time. We have one in our home office and another at our business. I suggest you purchase a USB Flash Drive and install the Cisco Connect software on the flash drive (which allows you to have your other computers connect to the internet easily). Be sure to allow your router to create a password for you.......It will be a more secure password which you can send to a text file. Great Router!!

$REVIEW.: This is probably the most poorly made cable I have ever seen.  It came out of the box with a broken connector and torn insulation.  Got a look at the internal wires and they are smaller that any CAT5 cable ever experienced.I doubt this is Cat5 cable.  Someone calls it so but I have serious doubts.There is another way.  Go to the local big box store (Home Despot, Lowes) and purchase:Cat6 cable by the foot (about $0.30/foot) and the connectors.  The connectors come with a punch down tool.  Custom make a cable to length without special tools or training.Can even make the installation pretty by mounting a work box and cover.  The only bad part is climbing around the attic.  If you have to run wire spend just a bit more and run wire that is certain to work.

$review_text.: I bought this camera for use in my marketing works. I pick this camera because it small but have features of semiprofessional cameras & panorama. This camera comes with a small instruction book, and I think it because most instruction is already in camera "nice feature". The zoom is great, clear, and focus very well in both optical and digital 16x is = to 28 to 384 mm on SLR "very good for such a small camera." We are normally have to take pictures of labels and damage product in the ware house, and have to bring them down to take close up 4" x 5" label, and now I can just take picture by using the zoom up to the rack itself. This cut down a lot of works.Pros: Many deferent features, instruction on camera, prefect zoom, stabilizer work excellent on the zoom in comparison with other camera, excellent panorama no other camera that I know has it. It has highest processor 16 MP. View the pictures without have to turn it on just press arrow button, and very sharp images LCD. It takes excellent pictures on low light. I like a little grip on the right hand so you can hold it better. Small enough to carry around for such as high power zoom, the digital zoom is also clear, and give a little effect of soft background like SLR camera. It is not a true soft back ground image as SLR because this camera uses digital programs to create it, but it works. Dial and button are easy to use.Cons: Short battery life even if you carry 2 battery still may run out too soon, battery hard to take out, cable on the bottom make it have to lay on the Len or LCD not a good camera protection, should including separate charger like canon this way you can charge a battery while using the other one, also take too long to charge inside the camera. The flash is over expose with light Asian skin color (too light)especially taking picture of 2 deferent complexions this camera can't adjust to correct the skin colors, Panorama does not works with flash., slow processing because after taking picture it take a few second to finish processing this can make you miss next picture. Flash pop up where left hand holding camera you have to remember not to put the hand there. Do not force the flash back in place let it go back in when you shut off this camera, or it can get stuck. This camera is only available in black. After take the pictures, SD card is not working with other camera such as Canon, and not read by my PC's SD card reader, Canon does. Can't not view 3D on the LCD you must view with 3D TV. Only have a few languets not like Canon that have every country even Thai and Chinese. The auto drive up to 10 FPS is stop after 10 I which it continue so I don't miss the action.I add this review because I bought one hx9v for my self due to I like it so much. I will change review to 5 stars. The over all benifits are out over the negative review. There are a lot of function to learn on this camera, and the longer you own it you will like it more. This is alot of camera for your money compare it to Canon, Nikon at rhe same price point. The only thing is the len I am not sure it as good as Canon, and Nikon, but seem to give me great pictures.

$review_text.: This thing is great, it's like your own little electrical mini center hassle free mobile saver, it charged my T-Mobile g2x (P999DW) fast, and fully charged of course. This product arrived within two days of when I ordered it, and its packaged good and small enough, so it fits in a mail box (people need to post about if it could fit in a mail box). I just received it, it arrived half way charged and so far I have been charging a bunch of random gadgets with it including my phone. I recommend draining it by charging stuff at first and then charging the unit (not sure if you need to do that but I rather play it safe). It should charge any high powered smart phone or any phone for that matter at least 5 to 10 times, maybe more, will see with the g2x... I'll update more... Oh the size of the charger is about the same size as a quarter pounder with cheese : p lol (I know odd comparison). One thing I wish it came with is a cable so you can charge it from a computers usb slot; or any usb slot for that matter... I'll have to see if Trent has the cable for it to buy separately

Wireless connectivity flakes out frequently -- I have to reboot this unit about twice a week to reestablish connectivity to stations (my wireless router is about 30 feet away, and no other devices experience problems).The pros: sound quality is good, better than I was expecting, and consistent with the other positive reviews.  Frequent firmware updates, and lots of features (e.g., Pandora).Hopefully a future revision will replace the display.  The wireless issues should be fixable in firmware.

$review_text.: I wanted to spend as little as possible for SPDIF 5.1 from games, specifically Crysis, and this board was just the ticket. But being too smart for my own good, I tried to install it with the drivers from the Diamond website, and I got nothing at all out of the SPDIF. I thought I had a bad optical cable. I should have let Vista (32-bit Home Premium) have its head from the start. I then downloaded the right driver from C-Media, the maker of the chip, and, voila! DDL surround sound, pass-through of DD, and only one cable to add to the spaghetti behind my machine.

$review_text.: I really wanted to like these speakers - and for the most part I did when listening to a pair in a local Sams Club
As many of the reviews here have stated there are highs and lows with the Companion 2 speakers.First the Highs: I was very impressed with both the amount of Bass produced, and the clarity of the sound coming from the speakers
Individual instruments were clear and crisp, and not distorted or muffled


And there was plenty of bass for most casual music listening - probably the best I've heard from a 2.0 system.Unfortunately, there were several Lows that crippled the speakers (in my opinion)


First, from a sound quality perspective, there was a dramatic channel separation between left and right that never let a vocal track converge in the center of the listening stage


In other words, a main vocal track that normally (in my other higher end 2.1 systems) appears to come from directly front and center in the audio stage was instead very evident coming from both right and left speakers

It gave an odd surround sound feel that didn't seem natural to me
Secondly, the main speaker (with the volume control) apparently had less than adequate shielding as it was picking up a static/crackling when placed in close proximity to our Mac Mini that it was connected to

Move it further away and it was okay, move it closer and it started to crackle.I have several other Logitech speakers (Z3 and X230) that I'm very happy with, so I also tried a set of the X-140's with this same Mac Mini setup


 While I believe the sound was a bit more crisp in the Bose (and the Bass was more full), the voice is much better placed in the X-140s, and the Bass is the next best in a 2.0 system I've heard next to the Bose

They also very clear sound - and, there is no static or crackling from the X-140 even when placed directly on top of the Mac Mini.So, while the Companion 2 speakers have some very strong features, in the end I was overall disappointed and I'm keeping the X-140s instead as a very capable 2.0 setup - and for less than 1/2 the price of the Bose.

$SUMMARY.: Good, but also disappointing

$review_text.: i have build many HTPCs in the past for me and my family/friends


by far, the best HTCP/Price is fry's Antec NSK2480 for 50 dollars, and the best looking case is Silver Stone GD05B

but this is a review for black micro case, so let's get to it.1st of all, this is a good basic computer case

it came with a PSU which is great for the price it is demanding.now let's talk about few issues here if you use it for HTPC:1
does not fit ATX PSU2
does not fit ATX M/B3

does not fit more than 2 HDD4


does not fit 2.5 inch HDD without a 2.5 to 3.5 enclosure.5


a super, and i mean SUPER loud 80mm fan.now you might say: why the heck do you expect ATX stuff to fit in this case when it is a mATX case? well, the foot print of this case is every bit as large as ATX
Yes
the don't be fooled by the picture, this case is HUGE

it is narrow, but huge

this case is actually a good deal bigger than silver stone GD05, which fits a full size ATX power supply, full size graphic card 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch.so if you are thinking about building a HTPC, ignore reviews who uses this case for HTPC, they are obviously new to what HTPC case should look like

HTPC case doesn't care about the height (this case is about half the height of regular AVR), it cares about the depth and width
it cares about silence

this case is very deep, you won't be able to fit into your regular depth TV Cabinet
this case is very low, which means you cannot use 120 mm fan and pretty much forced to use the 80 mm fan it came with (and it is loud)

and the front panel looks way to cheap next to your thousand dollar AVR
i would give it 2 star for HTPC if that's what you want to use it for.NOW, this case did not advertise itself to be HTPC case, and i can tell you it cannot be a HTPC case (unless your definition of HTPC is a any computer output video to TV or AVR, in which case, my laptop might be a better HTPC)
How does it perform as desktop case? pretty good as a matter of fact
i would give it 3 stars


i have to, once again, deduct one star for lack of 120 MM fan and lack of 2.5 inch HDD native support
i would like to deduct 1 more star for lack of utilization of space: there is a ample amount of space wasted in the front, they would 1: get additional HDD space, 2: move the PSU to the front and free up some of the space.



$SUMMARY.: you got to be kidding me using this case for HTPC

I had been using a 12 VDC to 110 VAC inverter and the wall charger that came with the phone. Then I got this. Now I can charge my phone and one other device at the same time without using the bulky and noisy inverter. There are several other devices that look just like this one. This was the least expensive of them all. And there were similar units, some with only one port. This seemed to be the best value of them all. I assume they all work about the same.

Doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but has enough to satisfy all my photo needs.It delivers a very good quality image, easy to operate, and uses 4-AA batteries.  I recommend purchasing the Ultimate Lithium batteries.  I purchased this camera about a month or so ago, have taken a couple hundred photos and have done a few videos and the batteries are still good.

It is indeed safely waterproof and the video and photos are of excellent quality.There was no blurring or pixelation when you move the camera quickly while recording. It also works really well in somewhat low lighting (both pics and video). I used it on the beach and in the ocean. It held up great to the sand and the salt.My only complaint is that this sucker is plug-in recharge only. You can not buy a spare battery. This didn't bother me too much since the battery life is pretty good, but ultimately I like to keep a spare on me to change out throughout the day.

$REVIEW.: Well, I have to say that this case is amazing. Here's a list of the goods, bads, and neutrals.GoodsThe 6 120mm fans allows for an insane amount of air flow at low fan speeds, meaning better cooling while staying quiet.It has a bottom mounted PSU, which has to be one of the best features of a computer case.It has a simple thumb-screw assembly for the left and right pannels of the case. This allows for the assembly of the computer to be amazingly easy.I like the huge window on the side. Allows me to see my gear.The rather tall feet on the bottom allow for a lot of air to get to the PSU and the bottom fan. Just don't use it on carpet, unless you want to say good bye to your PSU.The front pannel does not have the power/reset buttons or lights attached to it. The buttons/lights are stationary on the case. It does have the USB and audio pannel connected to it, but the wires are very long.There is a very genius tool used to screw the motherboard stand-off to the case.I used the case-lock eye as a tie down for a lot of cables. Not what it was for, but I like it.The case is really light, but it still feels well built.BadsVery annoying expansion slots. There are pieces of metal that need to be broken off to allow for PCI/e cards. Once they are broken off, there is no way to get them back on.The mother board stand-offs don't mesh with all the holes on my motherboard. There are 3 standoffs that are out on their own. I guess my ATX motherboard is a little bit skinnier than normal.NeutralsThe front 5.25" expansion bays also have the punch-out sheets of metal on them. The only difference that makes this neutral instead of bad is that there are screw holes on these punch-outs that allow for putting them back on the case if needed.The top 2 fans cover the top 2 screw holes on the motherboard. I had to remove the fans to screw the motherboard down the rest of the way. Once the board was in, I put the fans back, no problem.Cable management is... minimal. There is next to no space behind the motherboard, and the space behind the 3.5 inch drives is not very well hidden. I don't mind too much since I don't have a video card to compete with (I went with AMD's APU series, doesn't need a vid card), but some other people might find this a bad.
$SUMMARY.: Great case!

$review_text.: All I really have to say is that it's a Wacom Intuos, and that means the best of the best when it comes to graphics tablets.  The Intous4 is by far the best tablet Wacom has produced. It's far more responsive and nuanced than the Intuos3, which was a fantastic tablet in it's own right.  But the 4 is so refined.  I'm not hearing good things about the 5, but I can't say because I've not tried one.  The Intuos4 is all I need.  I paint, draw, sketch, create textures for 3D models, and work in 3ds Max, Maya, and ZBrush with my Intous4 and I couldn't do what I do without it.  Wacom is the only name in tablets.  All the others are second.  Intuos4 or Cintiq 24HD if you're a serious artist, or even a part-time bedroom artist like I am.  I hear they are good for digital photographers too.  :)
$SUMMARY.: It's a Wacom

$REVIEW.: I bought 2 of these tablets as gifts


For an inexpensive tablets they are pretty fast

Since battery will drain from  a lot of use, its great that they come with USB charger

It's compatible with my LG phone car charger

Very light weight so it's a good idea to purchase a good case for it if children will be using
Very bad thing neither camera works


Camera app prompt "unfortunately, Gallery has stopped." Complete black screen without image


It doesn't help that the instruction pamphlet is pretty blah, not very detailed and hard to trouble shoot with limited info online
I have emailed Matricom support in regards and waiting for response.

$REVIEW.: Way too much static.  At first I thought it might work for pod casts of radio shows.  And, it sorta was ok but every time the car turns a corner or you drive near a wire or do anything, the static gets too strong to hear anything.  It definitely won't work for music.Reception is better if you hold device in hand but that isn't very practical for driving.  I tried setting it in cup holder, on passenger seat, hung from rear view mirror, sitting on dash board - all of these resting places caused more static.  I tried a variety of station settings - it's the same on all of them.

$REVIEW.: This is by far the most beautiful and functional TV I have ever owned. Set up was as simple as assembling the stand (5 minutes) and getting an extra hand to help me lift the TV onto the stand and then onto the entertainment center. After agonizing over the ST50, I ultimately ended up choosing the GT50 for the 4th HDMI slot and the built-in THX modes. I did not want the hassle of calibrating and I had read other reviews that stated the THX modes were great out of the box, and indeed they are. It was wonderful to be able to use it immediately without the hassle of calibration. Built-in wifi is also a huge plus and was a cinch to set up. It is in the same room as my router and is pulling 35-38mbps which is plenty for HD streaming. Aside from a few tweaks in the settings, such as removing the channels I don't utilize and removing the ads, I was ready to go.I am utilizing all 4 of the HDMI slots for my PS3, Xbox 360, Apple TV and a spare cable for my HD laptop for PC gaming on the big screen. Everything I have thrown at this TV has looked spectacular. I have been re-watching some of my favorite wildlife documentaries just to experience them in the beautiful HD. Panasonic provides a nifty little adapter for your composite cables as well so that's where the Wii ended up. All of the games and movies we have tried look simply gorgeous. My kiddo is a big Cars fan so we've logged quite a few hours playing Cars 2 on the Xbox and watching Cars and Cars 2 in Blu-Ray and with the 2D->3D conversion on, I feel like I can reach out and touch McQueen!I had an older Panasonic which was one of the first Smart TVs and didn't have as many useful features as this one. I love the built-in Netflix with the dedicated Netflix button on the remote. It's true that every single device I have plugged into the TV is capable of Netflix as well, but it's so much more convenient to just push the Netflix button and be there with one remote. The Hulu channel is also great and I was very happy to see Amazon Instant Video here as well. Having the ability to rent movies right from the remote is fantastic. You truly get a full suite of video entertainment built right in with the streaming movies, TV shows and movie rentals at your finger tips. Set up for these channels was a breeze and we were up and running with all of them in minutes.Among the other channels is a Skype channel (can't say I'd use this often, if ever) and an internet browser. I glanced right past the browser initially, automatically assuming it would be plagued by the same issues as all other add-on device browsers, namely slow, clunky interface and lack of flash support. This browser, however, has a speedy interface and working flash!! It's not as good as just plugging in my laptop and using my mouse and keyboard to navigate, but for those times when I just want to check something without having to get up and plug in the laptop, this browser is pretty decent. I was able to load up Hulu.com and start streaming The Office in seconds. I read the top review here on Amazon, however, and noted that he claimed he had to download the browser and enter his credit card info. I did not have to do any of this. When I first went to the Internet section (where the browser and other apps are located) it prompted me to update the software, which I did. It took a few minutes and that was it. I was able to use the browser (which was already present without a separate download) and was not prompted to enter any info of any kind. Just wanted to clear that up!There is a game/app channel as well, and aside from a brief peek inside, I haven't bothered with it. I am already too invested in other gaming systems to dump more money into another gaming ecosystem. It's nice for those who just want a few casual games, but I would rather buy something off Xbox Marketplace or Steam with my hard-earned money. That's just my opinion! All the other popular apps you would get with the Roku or Apple TV are available for download from the Viera connect store as well. Pandora, Tune In, Ustream and YouTube are my favorites, but I noticed a number of sports and specialty TV apps as well, including anime and adult content (which thankfully can be disabled via settings). Most of these require a paid subscription, but there was one really cute app designed specifically for kids that has a fairly good-sized library of completely kid-appropriate cartoons and is totally free. You won't find Spongebob or anything Disney here as these all appear to be "indie" style and many are only a few minutes long. However, not all of them were unknown as we found several that Nick Jr. airs between shows, such as Danny & Daddy. The interface is super simple so my kiddo really enjoys exploring this channel for new things to watch. All the apps we've used so far are superb. We are planning for an upcoming trip to Disneyland so one of my son's favorite activities is watching videos of the rides on YouTube. The app is really easy to navigate and I really like the auto-play feature that automatically goes to the next related video. The Netflix app also has this feature if you are watching a video from a series. Nifty!I was skeptical about the 2D->3D conversion upon ordering and assumed I'd probably not use it, opting to only view true 3D content. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually works quite well. Clearly it's not going to be as impressive as content that was designed for 3D, but for being an on-the-fly conversion, it's actually pretty great. Everything we have watched or played with the 3D conversion has been really nice. Via our Apple TV, we're even able to play our iOS games in 3D!! My 7-year-old absolutely loves this, as do I. Switching between 2D and 3D is as simple as pushing a button on the remote. Awesomely simple.My only complaint regarding the 3D is that I can't figure out how to activate it when viewing Panasonic's built-in apps, such as Netflix or Hulu. When you are "in" one of these apps, it disables the 3D button on the remote. I can only imagine that this was by design, but I can't figure out why. So if we want to watch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, etc, in 3D, we have to utilize our Apple TV which will then let me activate the 3D button on the remote once again. If I'm missing something, please let me know! I can't access the 3D button or the Viera tools button when in one of the native apps. Not a huge deal for me as I have access to these via my other devices, but for someone hoping to watch Netflix in 3D right out of the box, they may be disappointed.It's also worth mentioning that the TV does not come with 3D glasses. I realize that the Samsung TVs do, but the Samsung glasses are also far cheaper than the Panasonic glasses, so it's not really an issue for me. I picked up a pair of the Samsung 3D glasses and they work flawlessly with the GT50. They synced up immediately upon turning them on, no set up required. Very nice. However, if you are planning to use the 3D more than a couple hours a week, I recommend picking up the Panasonic glasses for one reason: batteries! The Samsungs have about a 6 hour battery life, after which you have to throw down $3 for another battery. Gets pricey when you have a family of glasses all running at the same time. I figured with 3 hours of use per day, I would spend the $40 I saved over buying the Panasonic glasses in batteries alone after one month of use. The Panasonics have a USB rechargeable battery that can charge right from your TV. I don't regret buying the Samsung glasses as I'd rather my little ones use the cheaper glasses, but I definitely recommend the rechargeable glasses for more heavy use.I really appreciate the energy saving options, although the eco picture quality is understandably terrible. I opted to set the automatic off options and stay away from eco mode as it just looks dark and muddy. The THX modes, however, are stunning and are easily accessed and swapped via the Viera tools button, which brings up a little menu at the bottom of the screen with various options, including 2D/3D and the THX/Eco modes. The room I placed the GT50 in is fairly bright throughout the day and on THX Bright Room setting, the colors are bright and vibrant and gorgeous. I was slightly concerned about this as I've heard plasmas tend to struggle in bright light, but not this baby! The blacks are also very deep and dark scenes are surprisingly crisp and clear. One of my peeves from my old TV (a 10-year-old 42" Hitachi) was the complete inability to see dark scenes during daylight. I have room-darkening shades in the room with the Hitachi because I have no choice, but the GT50 laughs at room-darkening shades!There really isn't anything that I don't like about the GT50, but I was kind of put off by the ads. They are very simple to turn off, but I was just annoyed at being pestered by ads from Panasonic after I had just spent this much on one of their  TVs. It popped up a banner on the bottom every time we used the volume buttons. It seemed a little cheesy to me. But again, easy to turn off and you're done!Love, love, LOVE this TV, and so glad I chose this over the ST50. It was worth it for the time-saving THX modes and extra HDMI port. Buy this baby!! You won't regret it! :)

$review_text.: This is my first HDMIKing product and my second HDMI cable (the other HDMI cable I own is a Monster Cable, so my overall impression of the HDMIKind is based on my previous experience with that cable). After seeing the high price of HDMI cables at the store I was skeptical of the quality of this cable (as well as all the other cables on Amazon in this price range, since a really crappy HDMI cable at the store runs $30 and a mid-level cable runs $70 for 6ft., and of course they go way up from there), but this cable really delivered on quality and performance.Long story short, like many people looking at this cable I didn't feel like paying a huge price for an HDMI cable, but at the same time I didn't want to get a poor quality cable either. This cable exceeded my expectations in both construction and value. For a side by side comparison to a Monster, in terms of an overall visual impression of quality and construction, it seems to be just as well made. At least as well made as Monster Cable's 500 series HDMI cables.Quality of construction aside, the overall picture and sound that it offers is excellent. Switching between this and a Monster Cable 500 offered the same picture and sound quality, with no noticeable difference.I was concerned about the double insulation making for a very stiff cable, but it really isn't that stiff. I've seen a lot stiffer double insulated cables. It's only slightly stiffer then a standard cable. Not stuff enough to really make a difference.For price and quality, you really can't beat it. It's a great product at a great price. I'm sure people could argue about what cable is theoretically better based on the technical specs., but in a real world application I can honestly say I didn't see a difference between this cable and the more expensive one.

$REVIEW.: Well, after sinking $170 into a corsair PSU the other day, I expected to have all of my worries behind me. Surely Corsair makes a good enough product to stand the test of time, right? Wrong. I woke up the other morning to find it stone dead after only 5 days of service. I hopped on Amazon and got this one ordered as soon as possible. It arrived the next day, and I was thrilled to see it, once the box was opened. The cables are ALL black, not just the coverings. The wires run parallel, not bundled into circular strands like the Corsair model. This makes for wonderful space-savings when trying to keep all of your wires behind the motherboard tray. It powered up right away, and is doing just fine, for now. If there are any problems, I'll go ahead and update, though I doubt it.This PSU comes with pretty much all the cables you will need for a very long time, if not forever.

$review_text.: My panasonic pro camcorder uses this battery - BUT I only use it for the external monitor and light - reason?  The Panasonic genuine batteries ($140) have a chip inside that says in memory copyright panasonic.  The camcorder reads that chip when it powers on.  It WILL work with these aftermarket batteries, but when I bought my camcorder I got an extra 3 year warantee by registering it on their website.Now comes the good part - power it from a non-panasonic battery and it logs that information internally - and VOIDS your warantee for using non panasonic parts.So this battery is good for my external 7" HD display and my LED on camera light, but can never go into the camera.Simple, right?

$review_text.: I've tried tons of other antennas from the $4 I spent on my last one of these, to $100 or so. Amplified, non-amplified, flat, rabbit ears, with movement options, etc.They just don't hold a candle to this one. I don't even mind breaking the ears as I can spend $1-2 for a replacement set of them from RCA or elsewhere. It's getting harder to find these antennas though, but I've easily purchased 10 of these over the past few years. I recommend this model to all my friends, who have nothing but great experiences with these.This is a none-amplified antenna, but honestly, anything that you see for under $50 or so that's "amplified" is probably not worth the money. If you really need an Amplified Antenna, spend the money for a CM3020 or the RCA ANT751. Even then, you still might not need a signal amp.There's just no competition from the LEAF antennas or any of the other expensive indoor antennas.

$REVIEW.: I bought this at Walmart on sale for 45 dollars and I bought a dual ds12 subwoofer to go with the amp. I have a box that is made of 1 1/4 inch mdf and I have some insulation in the back to simulate what polyfill does. any who this thing will pound!. I usually have it in my car and it sounds great in there to the point of the hair trick working if you push it as hard as it will go, though I don't like to do that since it will get very hot if you do that. Just for listening I have the gain at about half and it sounds very loud. my car puts out 14.7 volts so it is pretty loud. As of right now it is running in my room at 13.8 volts of my 18 amp continuous power supply (pyramid). The bass is clean and I have had no issues with it. The 30 amp fuse if running off of 12 volts means 360 watts. 13.8 =414 so the 400 watt claim for peak power is accurate. I highly recommend this amp and the dual ds12 subwoofer. a warning though is running it high will get it warm, but it still will run even if it is piping hot!UPDATEI tried this amp with 2 dual ds12 subwoofers at 2 ohm and it ran fine! this is 2 ohm stable and with that its probably closer to 200 watts rms. I didnt try since i didnt have the second sub installed in the box. I love it though works great after punishing that amp.off of my 13.8 volt power supply it would pull about 11 amps at 4 ohms of clean sound so roughly 151.2 nominal so the numbers are accurate!this is a quality amplifier and it will give really nice bass to your car.

I looked around and saw how most similar products were overpriced until I saw this pack. The quality isn't super but when you're getting them in that quantity and price it's really quite a bargain. I think I've only had to replace one or two of these so far and that's on a power cord for my laptop that I use multiple times a day, after months of heavy usage. Even then they still worked but were starting to peel a little on the thinner ends. I've also tightened up some extremely thick power cords and other things with them, almost anything that I could wrap these around and they hold up rather well.

You can actually semi-surf the internet with this Blu-ray once connected.Really does make old dvd's look better, MUCH BETTER!!!I still have much to learn about this player and interface; but do know enough to recommend it.For under a $100 how can you go wrong as this for a Blu-ray player.Longer Version:After dealing with SONY customer service in the past I have stayed away from SONY for many years for major electronics.Three years ago I purchased a 46&#34; Bravia TV, works fine last long time.Santa sprinkled cash under the Christmas tree this year so I figured time to get a Blu-ray player.I don't know about you but the first thing I do when reading reviews is go to the lowest ratings; YEP READ THE ONE STARS FIRST.  Let the buyer beware, well better to get the info from other buyers first.Armed with the one star reviews I decided to go ahead anyway and buy this machine.  I was worried about the WIFI connection as I didn't want to string more network cable from my router in my study to where my Blu-ray was going in the living room.  Connecting to the Internet was actually going to be a project for a later time, but since everything else went well I decided to give it a go.One of these days I will have to sit down and read all the directions in the manual, but for the most part using the Sony BDP-S3100 Blu-ray Disc Player is very intuitive.  Even the fact that the remote will control your SONY TV flawlessly as well. :)Forgot to mention that I am very thrifty and don't like paying for anything I don't have to pay for.  I did digitally sign the user agreement saying that I would not attempt to reverse engineer the SONY interface, except it would be nice if there was a visual differentiation for paid for features versus free features.  You will see what I am talking about once you get your unit as they are to numerous to mention each one individually.Well I better wrap this one up.* Suggest trying all the free features first before deciding to do any additional pay for options.* Would like to see a Bluetooth keyboard option (although may already have one and if so there will be a zillion comments below correcting me... lol)* Would like to see visual tags added to interface for:  Free, Sign up required, Sign up required PAY SITES.* Hope never to have to deal with customer service, but at this price if have problems just may work to just get new machine.
$SUMMARY.: SONY Blu-ray... Works... Controls SONY TV as well ;)

$REVIEW.: We brought this product recently on open box.  We were wondering maybe if it was a returned item.  However the unit worked (initially for about 10 mins).  Then it started dying.  The disk door won't open if it's hanging.  It can't load after a while and freezes.  I've seen similar issues one some HD processing systems due to the heat.  We tried loading different blue ray disks and ran into the same issue.  However when the unit is shut off for about 5-10 mins , we noticed that when it is powered back, it works fine for about 10 mins and then same issue.Then I removed the unit and noticed that it has very poor venting (only couple of slits at the bottom) and it was heating up.  We can even smell some of the electronic component(s) overheating with that typical burning smell (being myself an electronic major, I can tell that).  So I thought, how about I put a fan and help it vent.  So we put some old dvd cases under it on both sides to give it more space for venting and put a fan to it.  And it worked like a charm.  Although we got this dvd player on sale ($100 + tax)  we can't always keep a fan running while this works.So this is a fundamental manufacturing issue.  I've seen many reviews here indicating similar problems , but no one really experimented with the venting process and fans.I will be returning this unit back and move to something else, which has adequate venting and lesser issues.

$REVIEW.: For years I went with the Sony experience, as found the quality sufficiently high, and of course Sony prices unreasonably escalated


 I have grown tired of Sony's proprietary items, having found they do not work well with generic electronics and accessories or other companies' softwares


 After my last vaio computer with them two years ago, I have made a definite shift away

 They simply are not producing that good enough product anymore
 As fate would have it, I lost my best headphones and went to Radio Shack to test their supply

 To my ears, the Sony ones listed here (MDR-NC6) sounded best at my price point, and I enjoyed them so much I got onto Amazon and bought a second pair just to have them around in the event the first get lost
 By the way, I found Amazon's price muchg lower than Radio Shack's on these


 This is the only Sony product I will recommend.

$review_text.: This is my second Asus Eee PC and I love these little powerhouses.  They do exactly what I need for them to do and even more--I'm a writer and editor--and take up very little space. I did my research before I bought one (the significant other is a tech geek and I trust his knowledge) and I liked what I discovered.The Asus EecPC weighs nearly next-to-nothing and is super-portable, with many of the features of the larger and more high-end laptops.  This is a great netbook for students (I bought one for my niece in high school).  It came ready-to-run right out of the box.  It's also great for those people who want to get their feet wet but aren't ready to spend a bundle for a system that's more than they really need.The first one I purchased was the 700 Series 4GB (gigabyte) model and though it ran Linux, that wasn't a problem because it's compatible with MS Office.  I added an extra 4GB SDHC card and still have plenty of room left.  I liked that these were solid-state machines--meaning no moving parts--because I tend to be hard on electronics being always on the move.  The down side of the 700 Series was the tendancy to run a little warm and the relatively short battery life--about three hours.Now I own this version and am in LOVE!  Having the XP version has made my writing and editing tasks a pleasure and the larger screen--YAY!!!  It boots up very fast.  This one weighs a little more because of the 160GB hard drive, but compared to my HP Pavilion, it's like comparing a plastic dinosaur to Godzilla.  I'm still playing around with the various features and configuring it to my liking.I don't quite get the complaints about the size of the keyboard--have people looked at their cell phones and Blackberrys lately?  I think I'm getting carpal tunnel in my thumbs from texting so much! I'm perfectly fine with the Asus' keyboard size and find that I actually type faster on it.My only complaint is a minor cosmetic one--I bought the shiny black and it's a magnet for fingerprints--which is why I purchased the silicone sleeve a day or so later.  I'm happy now.Asus should be paying me because I've sold at least TEN of these to people while doing work on my commute.  If anything, these computers are a real attention-getter and sometimes I find it hard to actually do any writing because people are always asking me about it.

Pay attention to drop box selections in programs and on the web  until you get used to it so you don't select the wrong thing, but it is excellent for what it is designed for.It is very light and I'm not sure it would hold up for gaming, but I have a different ergo mouse for that.

$REVIEW.: I was able to acquire this cartridge for well under the normal cost here on Amazon. It is connected to my SL-1200, and run into my Marantz PM8004. Bass and treble are excellent, midrange not so good. I have noted that with classical music it does struggle a little, but with Metal and Rock it excels. Tools Lateralus played via the SL-1200 and the AT120E is very good, bass drums have great hit, cymbals and toms sound fantastic. But slap on Ravel's Bolero and the slight lack of midrange makes it seem as if its missing something. Piano music just doesn't seem as realistic. Fleetwood Mac's Rumors Never Going Back Again sounds pretty good, the picking of the guitar strings almost to the level of my project xpression with denon 103 cart. Of course I know we're talking about two different tables and carts here, but for the SL-1200 and AT120 to come close to the perfection that the xpression and denon cart achieved is saying something.So bottom line, great budget cart, if it is on a good sale I highly suggest purchasing it. But if you want better midrange and detail, a better "vinyl" sound I would suggest the Denon or the Ortofon Red.

$REVIEW.: You can read all the "specs" doing a Google search so I won't bore you with the geek-tails. The simple answer is that this lens does as promised. It is a very nice, fast lens, for a reasonable price. If you are in a "No Flash Photography" zone, then this lens will get the job done, providing you can take a few steps back from your subject. I took it out for it's 1st "test drive" last night at the local bowling alley. The shots were taken at night with 100% ambient artificial lighting and with the D200 cranked up to ISO 1600 had no problem pulling in 1/125 to 1/180 Sec. shutter speeds with the Aperture notched down a couple of clicks from wide open. While I have definitely not put it through all the paces as of yet, I do have a couple of notations:- I like the fact that the lens hood completely covers the focusing ring when reveresed (as in indoor use), yet leaves the zoom ring completely wide open. This makes for very comfortable usage being able to use the full length to steady the camera and having unfettered access to the zoom ring.- Focus is quick & silent, and I haven't yet experienced any auto-focus "hunting" problems.- Shots so far appear very acceptable. Please note that although I appreciate amazon's customer photo "samples", they manage to compress & reduce them so much that they lose a great deal of clarity. The images I've taken are much better than the few uploaded here. Bottom line, this lens takes quite nice photos.- Look & feel is professional & solid, with smooth as silk zoom & focus action. This lens does not "telecope" in and out as do many zooms. It's length remains constant from 50 to 150mm.- The one and only thing I do not like about this lens (and my other Sigma lenses) is that you cannot remove/install the lens cap when the lens hood is installed for outdoor glare protection. Nikon & Tamron lenses have a center pinch design that allows for easy installation/removal of the caps without removing the lens hood. I wish Sigma would do this as well. Some say you do not need a lens cap on when the hood is installed, but they obviously do not live in a dusty (desert) area. I almost knocked it down to four stars for that, but I'm simply too forgiving...

$REVIEW.: This case seems kind of expensive for a Kindle and I hesitated ordering it, but I'm glad it did. It protects it well, looks good, and it's comfortable in your hands. And I discovered accidentally that it provides some weather protection for your Kindle -- I accidentally left my Kindle out on my deck when evening and it rained that night. When I discovered this the next morning, I was fully prepared for a dead Kindle, but after wiping the water off the case, the Kindle powered right up and I'm still using it every day months later. I'm sure it wouldn't protect the Kindle in a hard downpour, but I was surprised that it did keep the device dry in a moderate shower.

$REVIEW.: Basically, this is a radar detector that syncs via Bluetooth to your Iphone or Android phone and shares it's detection of radars anonymously with the Cobra community.So, if I drive by and detect a radar in a particular area, that gets uploaded to the cloud.  If you then come along 30 minutes later, you will see the radar on your map - even if your radar detector hasn't picked it up yet -- because my radar detector picked up the signal and uploaded it 30 minutes ago.  If your radar then picks up a radar signal in the same area, it will alert you and upload that information to the cloud.  A third person can then come by an hour later and they will see that there have been two confirmed spottings of radar in that area way before his third radar picks up a signal.The strength of this system relies on having many people with these types of radar detectors.  Mind you, a police officer can also have this app  and see if he's been made by motorists so he or she can just move their patrol car a few miles down the road and set up camp there.Overall, I wouldn't use this to purposefully speed but it is nice to have another alert mechanism to help you check your speed and make sure you're being an alert driver.Please be aware that radar detectors are illegal in many places and even where they are legal police officers might be less lenient on you if they conduct a stop and find a radar detector in your vehicle.  It can be taken as probable cause that you were intending to speed - particularly if you were speeding.On the app itself, it has to be running for it to work so that presents some issues for iPhone users and it also requires you to look at it to make sense of it which can be illegal in some places and can expose you to risk while driving.  It also makes your phone have to do something else.  It's a phone and a radar detector and a map?  Seems like we're piling too much on our phones. On the plus side the radar detector itself beeps so you can use this as an abbreviated sort of radar detector without many lights and gizmos but you lose a lot of the intended functionality if you do and you can just get a much cheaper radar detector if that's all you need.Stay safe out there.

$REVIEW.: In a nutshell: simple to set up, powerful reach, excellent price for this refurbished router.I was looking for a router with dual-band N service. I was not looking for superb, all-encompassing USB connectivity which has been a concern with some reviewers. I can say that the USB connectivity is quite good for connecting an external drive to provide shared back-up service.I purchased the router through Amazon as a factory-refurbished unit. I plugged in the power supply and the WAN cable, connected to the router, updated firmware to the latest version (automatically), entered my SSID and a few other configuration settings and all of my network-connected devices connected easily to the new router.The router covers our house quite well with good coverage for both N and G service. This is an excellent router at a great price.

$REVIEW.: This is one of four Sony Radios I recently purchased. I wanted a whole bunch of radios for each room in my home, one in my shed, my Travel Trailer and one to keep in my JEEP. All the Sony radios are perfect. Just the kind of quality I would expect from Sony.What sets this radio apart from the others is it's very large Speaker, among other things. After purchasing all the Radios this one has become my absolute favorite. The radio accepts 2 "D" cell sized batteries which has kept my radio playing for well over a 3 weeks. I use the radio for about 5~6 hours per day.The large speaker is what makes this rig beautiful, though. It's has a full rich bass sound with ample mid-range and very sufficient treble. Compared to other radios with a single speaker (not including boom boxes) the sound from this Sony is almost High-Fidelity.I like that there is a large tuning knob which makes for easy, accurate and dead-on fine tuning. A also like the adjustable carry strap, too.. Radios with plastic handles can only be carried with your hand, this unit however allows you to adjust the the strap so the radio can be carried by hand or over your shoulder.This Sony sits easily on any table and is very stable since it's wide and not so top heavy to make it tip over if you accidentally bump it. The radio also has a very nice appearance. In the right environment the radio seems to add to the beautiful wood motif of my home.I've been a Ham Radio Operator for over 35 years so I think I am very qualified to offer these three very important characteristics for a radio. A good radio has to have good sensitivity, selectivity and good sound. Well, this radio has all three of those quality's which makes this Sony the perfect companion.FM reception is very impressive. I have six commercial stations on my Island and the radio receives all of them without me even having to extend the FM antenna. AM reception is equally impressive, I am able to hear stations 100 miles away loud and clear with very little receiver noise. I don't have to turn the radio all that much to try and capture AM stations either, so it's very sensitive, again with almost no receiver noise.All this being said and for the price it's being offered for, it's also a great radio to kick around town with. You don't have to worry about bumping it around harshly since it's easily cheap enough to buy another, not that I would do that but it's certainly a radio that can withstand some decent abuse.. Anyway It's pretty hard to find a decent sounding radio with good sensitivity, selectivity and great sound these days but this particular Sony has absolutely blown me out of the water. I highly recommend the purchase of this Sony. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.Thanks

$REVIEW.: This item works like it is advertised. However, it is grossly overpriced. There is no reason why TiVo cannot make an adapter that is more in line pricing-wise compared to Linksys and D-Link options. My unit was $99, and I paid $70 for the wireless adapter. Sort of a ripoff.The device itself though is easy to configure via computer. I like that it's a bridge. However, this means that if you change wireless networks that you need to reconnect the adapter to your computer to change the settings; the TiVo has no control over it.

$review_text.: Purchased the Amazon Basics USB 2.0 4-Port Mini Hub to use with my satellite receiver. I was hesitant at first because I had to return one purchased at another store. To my surprise I unpacked and installed the mini hub to my receiver. It worked like a charm. I plugged in my USB hard drive, camera, Sling Adapter and WiFi wireless. They all functioned very well and for the price paid it is a real bargain.

$REVIEW.: I use these chiefly for my computers.Two things you need to know about having a Samsung LCD, of any of the kinds and sizes they make:1.  They'll work perfectly fine if you attach a computer as one of the components.  I don't know why more people don't do this:  they're cheaper (currently) than a conventional computer monitor, and believe me, once you get used to it, you'll never go back to 19".  As for the Samsungs in particular, the "auto-adjust" feature really does work, and there is no residual fuzziness or unwanted screen crop -- although you'd better have a state-of-the art video card on your computer for this to render the crisp picture you're dreaming of.  The one that comes on a garden-variety laptop will never do.  This is something I was unclear on at first.  When I brought my first one home, I eagerly hooked it up to my computer, awaiting the ultimate 40" video gaming experience.  To my dismay, the picture lacked fine resolution, making the experience very unsatisfying.  I tried everything:  changing the settings on my video cards, exhaustively combing the Samsung's menus, replacing all relevant cables with top-of-the-line brand-name cables, and more.  It was only after everything failed that I realized this wasn't a shortcoming with Samsung's hardware at all.  It was because my computer's video card, while fine for a 19" conventional computer monitor, was inadequate to the task of projecting on to something that was 40" and still maintaining that fine, crystal clear definition that you demand.  It seemed like everybody understood this but me.  Anyhow, if you're planning on using one of these for your computer, make sure that you have the best video card you can buy.  If you've got dreams of hooking your computer up to one of Samsung's 52" jobs, I think you can forget about that for now:  as of this writing I don't think they make a video card good enough to do that, but give them time.  If this is your ultimate goal but you cannot wait for this development, I would suggest you simply buy a video projector for your computer, which, provided you have a suitable white wall, will give you that crisp picture you're drooling for at a fraction of the price -- plus with these projectors you can make your image a lot bigger than just 52 inches!I use one of these for my computer at work (40 inches:  I'm insane), and another, slightly smaller one for my home computer.  As I say, they work EXTREMELY well for this purpose, which is why I have three of them total:  I'm too leery to switch brands.  For example, the TV, when you use it as a computer monitor, has enough brains to shut down when your computer goes to sleep, and then to fire back up again when your computer wakes up -- all without your having to touch the monitor at all!2.  If used as a TV, this set can evidently do a lot.  Tragically, this will require you to get educated about the latest cables and connectors.  For example, I am wont to connect all my devices (Playstations, cable connections, VHS players, DVD players, Blue-ray players, satellite links, etc.) with red-white-yellow connectors, or, preferably, red-white-red-green-blue connectors.  As for the latter, this only has two rows available, plus an extra red-white-yellow on the TV's left side (facing the screen).  However, it has an array of other adapters (such as HDMI adapters) that I'm still learning about.  (These basically look like jumbo-sized USB cables, but can carry high definition sound and audio together in one cable).  If you're unclear on the in's and out's of this stuff, read the exchange in the comments below, which I found helpful.  I have never, for example, learned how to get the monitor's on-board speakers to route the sound the computer's putting out.I do have a couple of complaints, though:1.  It is my opinion that the on-board speakers are weak.  This isn't much of a problem if you're using this as a computer monitor, since the screen is right in front of you (the speakers are on the bottom, under the screen), but if you plan on using this as your main TV, I think you're going to be disappointed.  I think the technology could be a lot better, but I think the reason they do that is to sell you one of these:Samsung HT-TX75 DVD Home Theater System.2.  Screen burn is still possible, I'm here to say.  I would have thought manufacturers of TVs these days would have found a way to design their products so that this is no longer a danger, but not so.  The one in my living room still displays the ghostly word "Phillips" visibly whenever the screen goes dark on account of the night I left the DVD player on.  Make sure to use the screen saver on your DVD!Credentials:  I have three of these, different sizes.

$REVIEW.: I travel often to Europe, and in the past have always had hard time finding a proper power converter to help me use my electronic devices over there. However, I've finally figured out two things: 1. All those cheap power converters that you come across really don't work. A true power converter would be too bulky and too heavy to carry around, especially on a plane. 2. Most of the modern electronic devices don't need power/voltage conversion. They work perfectly well with both the US and European voltages. So what you really need is a plug adapter.This Satechi adapter seems to work reasonably well. It can adapt to the plugs and devices from the US, UK, Europe, and Australia. In that respect it's pretty universal. It also has a USB charger plug, which is an additional bonus since we are increasingly reliant on all of our small USB-charging devices.The adapter is very well designed and built. It seems sturdy enough to withstand repeated handling and vicissitudes of international travel. It is fairly compact, and its cubic shape makes it very easy to store.The most distinguishing feature of this adapter is, of course, the fact that it houses a fully functioning WiFi router. The router enables you to connect to an Ethernet cable and convert the wired Internet connection to a wireless one. This is particularly convenient when you are traveling and don't have an access to a readily available wireless networking. The router is easy to setup and use, even for people with limited networking skills. It is still a very powerful and highly customizable router, and it offers a wide variety of networking functionality. It can, for instance, be used to setup a private ad-hoc intranet, which may come in handy when privacy concerns are important for a small working group. I also wish that it enabled a networked storage access, something that could in principle be easy to setup with the available USB port. This feature would probably of use to power users, but could also be utilized as a family media server.Overall, this is a very thoughtfully designed voltage adapter/travel router that could really be of use to frequent international travelers.

$review_text.: I'm nonplussed at reviews mentioning how it's being used as a full-time connector for a SATA or IDE drive


 It's clearly not aimed at that market at all

 This is a kit designed for rescue/ recovery operations of someone else's HDD

 Case in point: me.I wrecked the partition table of my primary work HDD


 All in-situ attempts failed, so I brought the laptop home, mounted the HDD to my SATA cable kit, and ran the excellent TestDisk tool from Christophe Grenier
 My partition table recovered, I wrote it to disk and bright the HDD back into the laptop
 I'm back up and writing this from the work laptop now (don't say anything).I would never look at this complex jumble of wires and adapters and think "well, I'll just hook it up and let it go for a few years"


 No, sorry, incorrect application, despite the instruction manual showing you how to do it
 This is a stripped-down kit designed to travel with your rescue ops laptop when making a house call, like to Grandma's PC

 I find it's easier to run virus scanning, defrag, etc when the HDD is controlled by my known-good laptop.I withheld a fifth star because it's a complex mess of wires
 I don't know how one could make it look elegant and preserve its functionality, but whoever can do it merits the fifth star

 Wholly recommended product for rescue operations.-Fred

$REVIEW.: It is nothing short of a headache shopping for a new TV.  I find one I like and then a list of drawbacks sways me to another which has its own set of problems.  I was beginning to think a I would be dissatisfied with any TV I got (especially in the price range I wanted).  So after months of research I decided to go with the Sony EX 400 series 40" LCD.  It was nice.  Not fantastic, just nice.  It had some slight motion blur that I convinced myself I would just have to deal with, but then I saw a my friend's plasma.  Now I had considered plasma, but decided to stick with LCD because of reported burn-in problems, buzzing, and energy consumption.  I live in Colorado Springs (over a mile high), and so I did not want to chance buying a plasma.  However, after a brief demo at my friend's house, I was sold.  After having the TV for a while I am happy to report no burn-in, buzzing, or other altitude related problems.  It does slurp some energy, but that is a side-effect of plasma.  Plasmas have a definite bonus for me though: no blur.  Since the refresh rate is so fast it is almost like watching a CRT.  The black levels are superb (almost dark enough to suck the light out of my bedroom), and the colors are accurate.  The definition is astounding.  I cannot comment on the sound, since I use a receiver and speakers.  This TV does put out some heat, but is by no means going to heat the room.  I used some configuration settings I found on the internet which meant putting most everything on 50 percent (except, of course, for sharpness).  All in all, I am very happy with this TV and would easily recommend it to anyone.

$REVIEW.: I combined this product with an Olympus WS-802 and the combination makes for a very easy to use system.  I leave the parts continuously connected to my phone.  When I need to remove the recorder for playback (for example in the car), I just remove the Olympus, and leave the coupler connected to the phone.  Great system, easy to use.  When I make a call, I have lots of time to turn on the Olympus, and then start recording just before I place the call.  When I receive a call, it takes me about 3 seconds to turn the Olympus on, and start recording, and then I pick up the phone, as to capture the entire conversation.The voice quality of the setup is pretty good, it captures only the left ear channel from the phone.  I'm guessing this is because of the phone, since normally, the handset is place only on one ear so there's no need to carry two signals (left and right).The phone I use is a Polycom 501 IP phone.  But it doesn't really matter what phone, as long as the chord to your handset (that connects to the base) has the same kind of connector as most phones have.  Whether IP phone or regular phone, the link between the base and the handset is analog I think... it doesn't make sense to put a bunch of sophisticated electronics (digital technology) into the handset, so I think all phones use analog signal from the base to the handset.

$review_text.: If you're looking for the one sentence review: this receiver is absolutely amazing.  Now I'll tell you why:HDMI OSD: I use a projector, which leaves the receiver sitting about 10 feet behind me.  OSD lets me see what the volume level is without turning around and squinting.  Furthermore, browsing the menus on the receiver is so much more pleasant with the OSD.Network connectivity: I thought this would be a gimmick, but it is NOT.  One thing that is odd to me is that it's only wired internet.  But I have a mac mini hooked up to the projector anyway, so I'm using its Internet Sharing feature to get network connectivity to the TX-NR609.  I've been listening to Pandora radio so much since I got this receiver.  I love that the song info is shown on the receiver, and also the OSD.  Sure, I could have fired it up on the mac mini, but it's a pain to manage a keyboard and mouse compared to having it all controllable from the receiver remote.  I find that I'm using and will use this feature a ton.  Another AWESOME side effect of this is the ability to upgrade the firmware over the internet.  I've done this once already and it was painless.HDMI:  The functionality of this receiver is great when it comes to HDMI.  Plug in whatever you want: composite, component, hdmi, and it all goes out to the display via HDMI.  This means I only have to run one wire to the projector.  It's such a great use of technology and I love it.  Onkyo did a fantastic job with this.  There are many options for controlling the output/upscaling in the setup menus too.  And again, OSD makes these a breeze.I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no problems with the sound this thing pushes out.  I have 2 floor tower speakers and a modest center channel.  They all sound great.For the cons: the OSD could use some improving.  It's slightly sluggish.  Especially for the network menus.. there is some weirdness.  I find that sometimes I can enter the setup menu from NET and sometimes I cannot, and I generally cannot move around the setup menu when I do.  Same with the HOME menu.  This can all be fixed in a firmware update I'm pretty sure.  And it's not the biggest deal in the world.  The receiver works great in general and as long as you are mindful of these few small things, you can keep the experience completely positive.In closing, please continue to innovate the home stereo receiver, Onkyo!

$review_text.: I bought the Nexus 7 direct from Google when it went on sale in July of this year. It's an absolute great value at $199. The $249 asking price was viewed as suspect even back then because it's a $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage. Just for the sake of comparison a 8GB SD card can costs as little as $5 and change. Even the more pricey cards I've seen weren't more than $14. But still, the N7 is a 7 inch quadcore Tegra3, 720p tablet that ships with Jellybean (Android 4.1) and gets first-in-line support direct from Google...for $199 - $249. It's a sexy proposition even with the newly announced iPad Mini. Summary...The positives -- Runs the latest stock Android with support direct from Google- Supports full customization and apps that Android allows with no UI skin and no excuses.- Incredible value for the price between $199 - $249- 720p HD screen- 7 inch form factor is very convenient- Runs smooth- Good battery life (over 9 hours)The negatives -- There's no microSD (mSD) card slot- $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage- Build quality is suspect with many units. There's issues with the left side of the screen coming a bit loose from the housing.- There's no MHL support to go HDMI out from the N7 to a receiver or HDTV. (see Nexus Q for the reasons why)- Google is going to announce a 32GB Nexus 7 for $249 in a few days, effectively burning anyone that bought the $249 16GB N7 3 months ago.Final word - There is a lesson that many people must keep in mind when using Android. If you can help it all at, only buy non carrier branded Nexus devices. This is to guarantee that you get first in line support direct from Google for at least 18 months, it also guarantees that you will get a pure Android device without any UI skins, carrier bloatware (apps) or modifications included. The Nexus 7 is a great device that suffers from the lack of expandable storage and shipping with only 16GBs max (currently, this will change very soon). It also suffers from build issues resulting in some devices that creaks on the left side of the screen. Because of this, it's not a 5* device even for the phenomenal price. But it is hands down one of the best tablets you can buy at this form factor, not just the best Android tablet. Although the Nook Tablet is excellent and the Kindle HD Fire deserves a nod, the problem with these devices is that they run a skinned (read: not pure) version of Android. There are key features these devices will simply not have that the N7 does. Examples being, Google Play access, Google sync, Google apps, Google support. Support for these devices are suspect at best But the N7 can still support Barnes and Noble and Kindle features through their apps.Close to perfect but not quite. Still the N7 is the tablet to beat for the price.

$review_text.: I have a lot of cd's that were stored in 3-4 places.  Trying to find one of the cd's that I wanted to load in the car changer had me running all over the place.  I bought 4 units that store 20 cd's each for a total of 80 and they are almost full.  BUT, they are at eye level and I can read the labels.  All 4 arrived in one box and were neatly packed with no damage.  they are not bullet-proof but they are strong and well made to do the job.  I will be ordering more just to have them on hand.  A very good value and a well made product.  I recommend them to everyone who wants clean, simple storage in a small space.  Having 2 spaces on each unit for double cd boxes such as Forrest Gump (my favorite) is a great feature.  Just a hint:  Buy one or 2 more than what you think you need.  Storing in a book case at eye level helps this 60's guy read the titles without squinting.

$review_text.: The ASUS Black Diamond dual-band USB adaptor is just what I need to improve the wi-fi capability of my laptop computer


This replaces an older "n" unit that I was using

That one kept losing its signal or dropping down in speed constantly

This ASUS unit looks good, and has a high-end finish


The old unit that I had broke apart in two pieces (its cheap plastic case was not well made)
The ASUS unit appears well made, and it maintains a high throughput and broadcast speed

So far, ASUS seems like a good buy
Be advised, however, that the actual body of this "dongle" is wider than most USB ports
So, unless you use the provided extender adaptor, you'll be limited on where you can permanently install this unit
With, or without, using the adaptor, I get a 5x5 signal
Excellent!

$REVIEW.: I had read about these covers for DSLR's and before I could even decide if I want one for myself, I found this on Amazon (Amazon is like genie who keeps suggesting things of interest). Before I can blink my eye, I had this ordered.This fits very snugly and adds some grip to my Nikon D7100. Honestly, it might take some time to get use to it as it does add bulk to your camera and even the marking for the buttons are not very clear but all this balances out when you realise how important is it to protect your costly gear. You will need to remove your horse shoe cover that came along with DSLR and slide the one thats part of this cover. Honestly it's annoying but then you get used to it.It comes with screen guards for back lcd and top info lcd.

$REVIEW.: Apple decided to remove firewire 400 from all of their current generation laptops and add only firewire 800.  There are still a lot of devices on firewire 400 and thus you have 3 choices.1.  Buy this cable.2.  Buy an adapter.3.  Buy all new hardware.  :-)I chose 1 - simply because it is easier for me to have a cable that converts 400-800 rather then using an old 400 cable with a dongle adapter.  In my experience dongle adapters usually get worn and due to their size end to stick out of ports and break with an accidental leg/arm movement etc.....  I have had it happen to me in my mac pro...and what a project it is to fix.  Therefore...cables win.Hope that helps.

i haved looked at a comparable intel processor and i can tell you the price is up the wazoo.Performance: i find this more than enough to do anything i need and to the average person they wont notice a difference between this processor and the best there is out there

$REVIEW.: Okay, so I guess you could chalk this up to user error, but I thought people would like to know what I wish I had known before I bought it.This will only work if you have an outlet near your outdoor antenna. Since my antenna is on an exterior wall of my house, there is no outlet there. As such, this was useless for me. I did end up bringing it inside and trying it on the line with my indoor antenna, and did not notice much difference in reception.Unless you have an outlet within four feet of your antenna, this is not the solution for you.

The audio is very crisp and clean, and the bass is awesome, so I do appreciate these headphones for those qualities. Unfortunately, since they are kind of hefty, I find that the weight and pressure of them makes my ears hurt after a fairly short period of use. The design, however, is pretty cool. They have an all-around stylish look to them, and they fold up very neatly.

$REVIEW.: This radio has some pretty cool features for the price.The USB port can be used to support Large Disks (I had a 500gb western digital hard drive connected) although the interface is a bit lacking for such large libraries, there is still a "scroll" through folders


To make this easy to use there needs to be a little forethought into the names of your folders and how the structure is made.The EQs are a bit lacking, but they can be used to take care of problem frequencies on mid to high end speakers.The "rear input" is a bit misleading


You'll need a special connector to take advantage of that.Also, only 4 preamp outputs sucks


You cannot run Front/rear/subwoofer


You can only do front/sub or front/rear

I never had a problem with either of those things, but I can understand how they were an annoyance to others.This new version, though, has been a nightmare.  The USB connector is simply too loose to provide a secure connection.

$review_text.: I wanted an MP3 for swim training in the pool for the long MN winters and shopped online for weeks to try to figure out which one I wanted.  After countless review read I ended up ordering both the Diver and the Speedo Aquabeat.  I shoppped all over and was unable to find any in a store which was really frustrating because I was worried about how the ear buds would feel.  I can't wear the new plug type because they hurt after about 10 munutes.I found myself unable to load the Diver until I read the instructions for the Aquabeat which gave directions to convert my Itunes to MP3.  It's not hard, I just didn't understand how to do it.  That caused a little grief and frustration but once I figured that out, it went well for loading both.Basically, for the money and limited use, the Diver is just fine.  It is definately more "tinny" than the Aquabeat so if you are a real music nut then spend some more money on the Aquabeat.  If you are just looking for a fill in MP3 to swim with a few hours a week, it is great.  I have yet to try anything other than music but think it would be great for Pod casts.I found the ear buds on both to be pretty good.  I don't think the Diver are really waterproof as they to tell you not to get them wet.  I have.  It happens.  They move around.  Sometimes they stay in perfectly and sometimes I have to constantly mess with them.  If no one bothers me and I don't take them out right from the locker room, then they are better.  If I take them out because someone tries to talk to me (!) then I usually end up having an issue for the remander of the swim.  Better to shut the thing off and try to listen than take them out.  I think if you made sure your ears were really clean, like gently Q-Tip them out with alcohol they wouldn't slip out from natural oils.  I don't wear goggles but I wear a swim cap so I just tuck the unit up under in the back.  No problems.

$REVIEW.: This is a mighty powerful remote, but it does take time to learn the programming method (software) and to put all of the information into it.  I would not recommend it to most users unless you have trained installer to do the initial setup for you or you enjoy that sort of thing.However, that  said, it is a great remote to use.  My wife was able to use it almost immediately without any special training.  My 7 year old uses it pretty well, too.  Especially nice is that once you have it programmed, you can program a second one identically without any additional effort.  It is also flexible enough to be used for home automation systems - not just entertainment systems.I recommend having 2 sets of rechargeable batteries (4 - AAA) because it does go though them in about 6 weeks.  I wish the screens could be renamed and that button names were longer than 5 characters, but those are my only real complaints.By the way, RF remotes are the only way to go.  You can put your components inside a cabinet.  You don't have to aim any particular direction, you can even be out of the room.  Range on these is quite good - I control my house from the front yard without a problem

$review_text.: Just got it a couple of weeks ago and so far I'm very happy with it.  The screen is bright and beautiful (LED technology) and it comes with an HDMI connection.  And all the specs are good.As always, the built-in speakers are completely useless - sound like crap (I still don't get why they even bother putting it in).  I gotta say the vertical viewing angle is not the greatest (looking up at the screen is slightly darker...looking down at it brighter).  But then again it's very much a standard for monitors in this price range.In the end, there's one thing you have to keep in mind: while it's probably one of the very best monitors you can get for under $200 (if not THE)...it's not exactly the best monitor money can buy.  Having done my research, the ones starting $400-$500 range are basically in a different ballpark.  So you pretty much get what you pay for.  And in this case, for this price, you get PLENTY...in fact WAY MORE than you ever could before.  So if you're cool with not having "the best" for now...and need a good monitor for cheap - this is the one.  For sure.

Generally speaking photo hardware like stands under $150 tends to be suspect. Since I am a mobile and work on location mostly I expect my equipment to take a beating. For the price of $65 shipped, I consider this boom stand good value. It probably won't hold up like another brand name so I know I'll have to be more gentle/The hardware for tightening are plastic so I have to be sure not to put too much weight on the boom. It should probably work ok for one Speedlite and a light modifier. I wouldn't mount a studio flash on this boom. If I did, I would make sure an assistant is stand right next to this boom.I might update this review after a few months of use but I'm not too disappointed with this boom.

$review_text.: In our house now I couldn't really do a real 5.1 set up so I researched this Single Speaker Array and was pleased enough with the reviews on home theater sites to let this be in my final choice category. Being a 50% off sale sealed the deal. It turned out to be an awesome choice! I bought this for TV and movie watching.First of all this speaker is well made. It is clean and solid. It is also really heavy, heavier than I expected. The casing is metal and has a soft brushed look. The speaker cover is tight and smooth the whole way through. The mounting system is simple but strong, and the additional parts for it to stand on it's own uses the wall mount and makes it so you can adjust it to point where you need it to, make it level without scratching up anything.As mentioned by someone before, if you can do a real surround sound setup then do it, but if you can't this would work great. It tricks your ear by using L/C/R+RL/RR channels. You will have to run all five channels to the speaker from an A/V receiver since it is not self powered.The instructions are clear and easy to read. It tells you exactly how to set up your A/V receiver. Basically you set all speakers to small and sub to sub only, turn off all delays and enjoy.This speaker is compatible with 6.1 and 7.1 by adding the remaining speakers to the room, but if you need something like this, then you probably can't do the 6th or 7th speakers.Not only will you need your own A/V receiver but you will also need to add a subwoofer to it since the small speakers can't generate the lows that are needed in that .1 area. I bought this with the Definitive Technology ProSub 800 Subwoofer and they complement each other perfectly. The little speakers in this bar can get loud when they are needed to be loud.I tried this out with the HD DVD version of Shaun of the Dead and a TiVo HBO HD recording of Dark Knight in Dolby Digital 5.1, but kept getting distracted by the movies to remember trying to listen to the surround sounds. From what I can remember the sound did feel like it was coming from different areas, but not like a normal stereo, 2 speaker, setup.I am using this with a Yamaha RX-V730 A/V Receiver and Definitive Technology ProSub 800. Dark Knight played from an HBO HD recording on a TiVo Series 3 HD in 5.1. Shaun of the Dead was from HD DVD on Xbox 360.With Amazon Prime's $3.99 next day shipping, this was a steal, especially since it is so freaking heavy.

$REVIEW.: I purchased my first Linksys router (exactly the same model) in 2001. It was working without problems until December 2007. Long enough. Having good opinion about the product, I purchased again the same model. Mistake - it must be manufactured by different company. Front panel different, with less information LEDs, but I don't care. Setup was OK. Then... After about 6 hours it started resetting itself, there were permanent losses of conenctivity, I had to reboot router every few hours, internet phone conenctions interrypted after few minutes.I dumped Linksys and purchased cheap DYNEX. No more problems. It seems that Linksys outsources manufacturing to some place that manufactures trash?...

$REVIEW.: With all the pictures, movies and music my family enjoys, there never seems to be enough hard drive space to store it all. I bought this 2TB external drive to expand the storage in the family computer and it works perfectly. It was easy to install and immediately came up as another drive in my computers file explorer. I simply plugged in the USB connector, plugged in the power and once it booted up I could immediately start moving files to it. Since it's a USB 2.0 standard the file transfer is fast, almost as quick as an internal drive. I like that it runs silent and doesn't generate any heat either. I almost forget it sitting on my desk except when the activity light blinks when files are being transferred. This will be plenty of space for me and if I ever need more I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one of these units for the computer. I also like that Seagate manufacturers the hard drive used in the unit and know that I'll have years of trouble-free use from the item. If you need more hard drive space, pick one of these up today.

This product is fantastic, image is clear with no interference problems, WI-Fi and Microwave is not a problem anymore.I give it only 4 stars because the range of the IR receiver seem to be shorter or less strong than my previous sender, so from time to time changing channels is a problem, however the image and sound quality of the transmission makes it up for that minor problem.

Speakers in the back was a bad idea and my old kindle fire was louder than the HD. Not anymore, the ports redirect the sound to the front and I can finally hear TMZ loud and clear. The other covers caused heat build up and reduced the battery time noticeably. I am 62 years old and a geek. Sure I have arthritis,so the fat cover is easy to grip. Marketed as a kid cover it is THE old person cover and even the middle aged person cover. I love it. I was hoping the price would come down even more, but glad I went for it.

$REVIEW.: I bought this radio for my 86 year old grandmother

She loves listening to the radio, and loves good sound, but gets a bit unnerved by more modern designs.This table radio is simplicity itself

Just a volume control, off-on-FM-AM band seletor, and a tuning knob

The cabinet is walnut, and the fit and finish are excellent
Unlike so many of the cheaper radios, this one has some heft to it.The place this radio shines, however, is the sound
I was astounded at the rich clear sound it produced when I demoed it for my grandmother


So was she

This radio sounds much more like a good micro-mini shelf system than it does a table radio


I thought my vintage model was good...and it is...but this one blows it out of the water


Bass response is excellent for its size (maybe a little bass heavy but it's not muddy sounding), mid range is clear, and highs are crisp and clean


No tone control is provided but none of us found it necessary.The tuner was also nicely sensitive on both AM and FM bands, pulling in stations cleanly from an overcrowded dial in a metropolitan area
No bleeding over of stations

Tuning is assisted with an indicator light on the tuning dial....that feature is questionably useful


I tune by sound and didn't fiddle much with it.The radio also has a line in and record out for hooking up other components such as mp3 players and tape recorders


I didn't try these so I cannot tell you how well they work
If the radio sound is an indicator, your iPod should sound quite nice.Overall, I was delighted with this purchase


More importantly, so was my grandmother
I think that this would be an ideal radio for anyone who delights in simplicity and quality


The sound is hard to beat, and it's a great value for what you get


I will also most likely get a Sangean clock radio when my current model dies.

 The key finders work, but often you have to reset this thing all too often

$REVIEW.: These headphones came in a larger box because there was another item I had ordered in the same box

 Packaging was perfect and delivered on time
 I ordered these particular headphones because JVC is a trusted name and the reviews were mostly good


 I also wanted a pair with a single cord, not one to each side meeting in a Y to plug into my laptop

 These filled the bill nicely
 The only complaint I have is the piece that rests on the top of your head is hard plastic with no padding at all and after a short time it gets uncomfortable
 It would have been nice for them to pad that a little


 It wouldn't take much


 Other than that I love them
 The sound quality is great,  I would recommend them to anyone but would find a way to pad that upper piece some way


 I have it wrapped in a small cloth which is helping a lot.

$review_text.: I really should have read these reviews first. I will be returning this product.In brief, the pros: Solid construction, well made unit. Should last a long time. Easy to use and get working.Cons:Terrible audio quality. I had to find a new FM channel nearly every day, sometimes many times a day. Even when I did find a decently clear channel there was still a background of static and noise and the audio quality from the ipod was inferior to that of even regular radio channels.Even tho it says made for the iphone when I plug it into my iphone I get the warning "this accessory is not compatible with the iphone" - it does seem to work ok and charge the unit but... i sure hate seeing that message. Makes me think I am doing something wrong by using it.If i move the ipod around to change songs or such, I'll get bursts of static on the radio! What is this 1970 technology?Too expensive for the poor audio quality - if it was $19.99 I might keep it as a back up or for when I am in a friends car or a rental car. For $70 this is going back immediately.

I found that while playing this sub, I am unable to get the really deep base I get out of my Cambridge Soundworks and therefore the lower rating.  Now, I am not saying this is a  bad product though, quite the opposite.  It is a very good speaker with crisp base sound and is able to give sufficient lows for most music/movies.

check to make sure it will send picture messages


We didn't try ours until a year after we got it
Really had no need to try before then

Used it to take some very important photos and expected to send them out to family

Phone will not send photo messages at all by direct method or as email message attachments

Text messages are fine but not photos

Contacted Tracfone and they could not help .


told me phone is not capable of doing that .
even though the box, ads and the phone itself says it will
Tracfone told me to use bluetooth to send photos to another device

I tried that but phone will not exchange photos on bluetooth, only contact lists and calendars
The next Tracfone tech told me to buy a cable to download pictures to my computer USB port .
she said there is software online to do that


I bought a cable .

no software online will dowload to computer .


only makes it so you can charge tehe phone off your computer

Wasted $5.00 on that cable
Tracfone tech people gave up


Contacted LG and they wouldn't even help me ..they said phone was out of warranty
There is no removable data card in the phone so a card reader won't help
I now have a phone full of important, irreplaceable photos and no way to get them out

This is my last Tracfone purchase and I will never buy another LG product of any kind


They basically dusted me so I guess I am an expendable customer! Don't be the same .
make sure your phone does ALL the features it is supposed to do while you can still get your money back if it doesn't


Why hjave a camera in a phone if there is no way to get teh photos out of the phone? What a waste of time and money and our memories! SAD!

$REVIEW.: The build quality for the price is actually quite good. I am not using this as a telescope mount. I built a sky tracker system for my digital camera and needed a better altazimuth adjustment for aligning with Polaris. The ball head I used just kept getting off track as I tightened it down with the load. This tripod has large handles that turn easily and firmly which allows a quicker, smoother, more accurate fine adjustment. The only problem I had was figuring out how to move the head up closer to my altitude setting. There where no instructions included (I don't know if this was repackaged,or an oversight) so the only way I could see to do it was to loosen some locknuts. As I started to loosen the locknut, the whole head raised up! Then I realized that all I had to do was pull on the head firmly to adjust the altitude up or down. The locknut was to adjust the tightness of that movement. Very simple but would have been easier if I had the instructions!Out in the field it works quite well. The feet are pointed so it sticks well in loose soil. It is heavy enough to support a decent weight. My sky tracker with camera and lens weighs about 8 pounds and the tripod doesn't budge even in 10mph winds so I am happy there! I would have like it to get a little higher because I have to bend down to look at my camera's screen for night photography but the tripod was intended for telescopes so I'm sure it is plenty high for its original purpose. All in all, for the money I think it is a solidly built tripod and money well spent....for my purpose!

After considering the cost and the amount of times that I would actually use coaxial cable tools, I changed my mind and I purchased a bunch of cables (123 feet) for my antenna installation. They feel and appear to be much higher quality than the cables that I would find in the stores. I also really like grip caps and I think they will provide extra protection especially outside. As for the performance, I know these cables are delivering an absolutely amazing picture quality. I am very happy with the cables with the Winegard FL6550A FlatWave Antenna.

$review_text.: I was an early adopter for this camera when it first came out. It was my first 4/3 lens. I purchased it after the whole craze started boiling down and the prices became decent. Later I traded this camera for a white version, which was the same in every aspect, but was a glossy white instead of a matte black.The GF-1 offers great quality that surpasses that of a point and shoot (and interchangeable lenses!) but still of course, lower than that of a full sized DSLR.Why would I want to go with an in-between? Because the GF1 paired with the 20mm pancake is still years ahead of DSLR in terms of portability.I've taken this camera along with me to activity-intensive areas, such as hiking/climbing in Hawaii, climbing the lower slopes of Mt. Rainier, international traveling through Taiwan, Japan, Lebanon and various other places, bike rides through the neighborhood to as far as forests in Canada, to fishing trips just in the Puget Sound area. I even fought off zombies in a 24-hour intensive Humans vs Zombies larp with this thing tucked into a pocket. Now tell me you'd do the same thing with your EOS 7D/Mark II.Don't pay any attention to the crap that makes up the GF2-3-4-5+ editions of the GF series. Panasonic's greatest release was the first, much like the Canon S95 is better than the S100 (we'll ignore the S90 of course). If you really want an upgrade, consider the GX1, which is what I ended up grabbing after a few years, as I loved the body of the GF1 too much to go towards round crap offered by the GF2+.The best lens you can invest in as a staple lens is the 20mm pancake. This thing retains its value because it is THE lens to have on you at all times. Do whatever else you want with the other lenses, but know that that's the first one you should make sure you have.

$review_text.: I was looking to upgrade from my old 32" Samsung high definition television to a 40" smart tv (since I'm thinking cutting the cord and going to streaming and antenna).  My nephew has a 55" Samsung smart tv, and it is so sharp that it sometimes makes movies looks as though they were shot on a daytime television set-- sort of a shabby lighting setup. My old Samsung was a lower definition, and never looked like that, so I thought it might be a condition of the 1080 resolution.I am a fan of Samsung, but I saw this Vizio on display at Costco for a bit less than Amazon, so I thought I'd take a chance on it-- since I bought it locally it would be easy to take back if I didn't like it.No worries about that, however, I love this set.  I used most of the settings suggested by another reviewer here, and the result is a beautiful, sharp picture with wonderful tones.  The setup for my internet connection took maybe 30 seconds, and pairing it with the 32" Vizio soundbar (bought at Amazon) gives me great sound with no changing inputs when I switch from satellite, to streaming to DVD.Some people have complained about the remote, but mine seems to be very responsive.A very nice television that will likely suit me for many years to come.

$review_text.: Bought this Blu-ray drive for use on my late-2012 27" iMac


With the appropriate software (MacGo Blu-Ray Player, DVDFab Blu-ray Copy) it works well for playing and backing-up Blu-ray discs


The drive without a hitch whether connected directly to the iMac or to myPlugable 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub


My iMac reads Blu-ray discs at around 9MB/s so the USB 3.0 interface really isn't necessary
DVD read speeds consistently a bit slower than with myAmazonBasics USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer, which is a bit disappointing given the price of this drive
The brushed aluminum case is a good, but not perfect, match for most Mac hardware


All in all a decent, if slightly expensive, drive.

$review_text.: I held off purchasing these screen protectors due to some of the reviews indicating that they were either very, very difficult to apply, did not offer any glare protection, or did not help hide finger prints.  When I finally did order it and install it, I was relieved to find that none of that is actually the case.I'm sure some people had some issues applying them, and perhaps there are others out there that might hide glare and fingerprints a little better than this one, but in general for the price, they are very good screen protectors.I was able to apply it without much problem in about 20 minutes - something I was really concerned about when reading previous reviews.  The glare from the screen is considerably reduced, and fingerprints are not nearly as noticable - although they are still present to some minor degree.I really like the fact that they are a totally static-contact product - no adhesives or liquids to deal with at all.  In my experiences, liquids and electonics don't mix so asking me to spray something onto a tablets screen to apply a screen protector is just an accident waiting to happen.I also watched the installation video that they ask you to on YouTube, but found the procedure they demonstrate to be somewhat cumbersome when trying to align the camera and light sensor holes at the top of the screen.  My solution to this was to lift up the left and right sides of the protector as I aligned the two holes at the top center of the screen.  Once I had those two holes lined up, I layed the center of the protector on the screen and slowly let each "wing" of the protector down onto the surface of the screen.  This not only made it easier to align the holes, but also produced almost NO bubbles.  I only had to push out 3 or 4 near the edges and that was it.Hope this helps anyone who is trying to decide what to do about keep thier ASUS TF300T screen in pristine condition.

I like that it has options for changing aspect ratios depending on the programming and what kind of TV it's connected to.My biggest problem is that it will turn itself off after a couple of hours of not touching it. Say you're leaving it on the same channel all day (for sports or something). Be sure to adjust the volume or change the channel once in a while. If not, it'll turn itself off after a few hours. It takes a while, but it's still a quirky little issue.

$REVIEW.: I've been using a Mini-DV tape-based Panasonic PV-GS31 for quite a few years - it has stood up to some punishment and served me well.  After a pretty thorough evaluation, I opted to replace it with the Sony HDR-CX380.  Wow!  I love this camcorder.  Here's why:Likes:Weighs next to nothing.Fits into a pocket.Incredibly easy to use.Great feature set, from the built in USB cable to the touch screen, menu structure, external mike jack, auto lens cover, etc.At 8.9 Meg, the still shots are great - on a recent trip I left my SLR at home and really did not miss it!True HD, though having bought it I discovered that iMovie and the version of Final Cut Express I had could not process full HD (1920 by 1080).  However, with the direct HDMI connection, I can view full HD, and dropping down to 1080i does not seem to lose much in the way of resolution.Dislikes:Really none.  I wonder if it will last as long as my old Panasonic - does not feel as solid, but I plan on treating it with the respect it deserves.Bottom line - I'm still not sure about the debate over using a good SLR for video as well as stills.  For me, a dedicated (and ultra light) camcorder seems to make sense and works great!

However it does not matter because there is no eashy way of attaching it to the side of a bike or a ski helmet
It simply has no way to be attached to a bike helmet

The extra accessory that you buy for attaching the camera to the ski goggles does not work
Camera plus case plus mount gets fairly heavy and the goggle strap sags


I had to tighten it to the point I could not use the goggles because they become too tight on my face
Unless you are looking for a DIY project or planning to use GoPro accessories stay away from this camera

In my opinion Sony mounts for attaching the camera to the side of the helmet are completely useless.Update: updated to 4 stars since Sony introduced new mounting accessories.

$review_text.: The lighted part is great.The keyboard part is the problem


 Clearly it is of low quality and most of the keys stick, meaning that when you press them they do not register a press

 If you are not always ensuring that what you press was accepted you will see missing characters

 They also feel like they are sticking most of the time
 Not all keys are affected it seems to be about a third of the keys in various locations.This is particularly bad for a lighted keyboard as if you think about it the people who need a lighted keyboard are those like myself that do not touch type and tend to look at the keys when they are typing and not at the screen.It is still useable for me on a secondary computer that I seldom use and may be fine for others who do not type much and mostly interact through the mouse.

$review_text.: I'm a huge fan of Samsung's recent designs. Their phones and tablets (and TVs) have been nothing short of amazing. And the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is no exception.Despite the similar weight and measurements to the original Galaxy Tab 7.0, the Plus is a completely different tablet. The bulky and squarish designs are gone. The Plus now resembles the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which is still the best looking Android tablet in my opinion. It's very light and thin. The screen is fantastic with the right amount of saturation and contrast. Very responsive as a touchscreen as well.A big bonus is the Infrared Transmitter which transforms your tablet into a great all-in-one remote with the right software. I tried Samsung's pre-installed software and while it does work great, it's a bit slow. Perhaps there are better alternatives on the market.So we know the Plus is a great tablet, but is the operating system up to snuff? Well, yes and no. It's running Honeycomb, so at least we're not using an antiquated phone OS on a tablet. Everything's in high resolution as it should be. However, HC is not Ice Cream Sandwich. There's no support for hardware acceleration. At times, the OS can be quite sluggish and unresponsive. The good news? This can be easily fixed with an ICS update from Samsung. The bad news? Samsung are well-known for their poor and slow update roll-out. It's been over half a year since ICS was officially released and their flagship devices (AT&T; GSII, Galaxy Tab 10.1 etc) are still waiting for an update. Yes, it will come, but might still take a while.Another big question is whether or not anybody should still buy this tablet now that there are cheaper alternatives? Maybe... The Kindle Fire and Nook are in in a different class since unless you're willing to hack your devices, you won't get a true Android experience. They also lack GPS and expansion slots. Now the only available competitor is Samsung's very own Galaxy Tab 2.0, which is at least $50 cheaper (I actually got my Plus for $270 so it's not really a big deal). Even if the price difference was minimal, I think I would pick the Galaxy Tab 2.0 this time around. Why? It comes with ICS out of box. That is its selling point. ICS is just so much better than any previous Android release. That being said, if you can pick up the Plus for less than the 2.0, it's still a great deal. The Plus is slightly lighter, and slightly faster processor. ICS update WILL come.OVERALL: 4 stars! 5 had Samsung released ICS sooner.

Only comes with one camera and to order 3 more will costs $375.00-$400.00.I BOUGHT MORE CAMERAS AND ANOTHER MONITOR. I HOOKED UP THE MAIN VIEWING CAMERAS TO A 42" TV AND ITS AWESOME. IF YOU HAVE ONE CAMERA THAT DOESNT HAVE THE 5 BARS SIGNAL, BUT A CHEAP EXTENSION CORD FROM CHINA AND RELOCATE THE ANTENNA FROM THE CAMERA 20 FEET CLOSER. I REALLY LIKE THIS SYSTEM. I KIND OF WISH MORE THAN 4 CAMERAS COULD BE SET UP TO THE MAIN RECEIVER CONTROLLER. I OWN SIX CAMERAS AND TWO MONITORS.-------------------------------------------UPDATED  ***PLEASE READ***AFTER ABOUT 9 MTHS TWO OF MY CAMERAS ARE BAD WITHIN A WEEK PERIOD. ONE DOES NOT GO BACK TO COLOR AND NEEDS TO BE RETURNED AND A SECOND CAMERA IS FUZZY WITH LINES AT NIGHT TIME ONLY, BUT IF YOU TURN A LIGHT ON IT LOOKS PERFECT.SO I AM NOT HAPPY I HAVE TO UNINSTALL TWO CAMERAS AND MAIL THEM BACK AND THEN REINSTALL TWO CAMERAS AND WONDER HOW LONG THESE WILL LAST. MAYBE A LOT OF MONEY WASTED IF THESE CAMERAS DIE WITHIN A YEAR OR LESS SINCE I OWN SIX CAMERAS AND TWO MONITORS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SYSTEM ANYMORE.

$REVIEW.: WOW! This is one great looking television.  I'm using this as a monitor on a system that has a few televisions and this simply displays video via an HDMI connection.  It is installed on the wall and, with no accompanying cable box, has a very clean look.  This unit does not have the Samsung apps, but since I'm using an HDMI connection, I'll eventually get a Samsung Blue Ray player that offers some of those widgets.  I am also using an HDMI switch and allows me to switch several inputs (Xbox 360, Blue Ray, Comcast, Roku) and I'll occasionally watch other sources on it through the switch.  I've only had this unit for about a week and have not had much time in front of it, but the picture is really great and the exterior looks great.Very pleased with the VERY speedy delivery by Amazon (via Pilot Freight) - the delivery company called and scheduled a date and didn't have a problem keeping the item in their warehouse for a few weeks until I was ready for it.  The delivery team brought it in the house and took it down to the basement with no problems at all.I bought a Samsung C7000 3D television at the same time - other than the 3D part, the image quality on both of these sets is very similar for the non-videophile type guy.  I can't tell the difference - they both look awesome.danbrew :)

$REVIEW.: I had this case a couple of years ago when I first got the iPad 2 and it was already a very good case.  Shortly after, I gave the case to one of my students when I opted for a more heavy duty leather case.  However, my student recently broke his iPad so I took the case back from him and realized how much I missed having a slim back case and a smart cover... only thing is, he managed to scratch up the case like crazy and the corner pieces were chipped.  So I went into my account and pulled up the exact case that I had originally ordered and ordered it again.  It appears they have made some improvements to the case and it covers more of the iPad.  The look and feel is so much better now and you can't beat the price for what you're getting!  Only downside is it took a long time for shipping.

$REVIEW.: ok, so I've owned 2 pairs of these, I've burnt them in for days, I've tried every technique out these in these same amazon reviews. bottom line is, these headphones sound FLAT. they are good for monitoring audio, for that they are great. before i keep going, i gotta say that build quality sucks, they feel cheap. the cable tangles easy too. however, they are comfortable because of their lack of weight. ok, now back to sound, they sound bad. instrument separation is so much that the track looses its feel, the highs are too high and bothersome, and the bass is not even there. the bass sucks on these. all those other reviews raving about bass are either full of it or haven't experienced good bass. Ive spent a lot of money searching for "good" headphones. in the end i ended up with a 25 dollar pair of JVC Extreme Explosives. now those i can rave about, for the price they are fantastic, build Q is lightyears ahead of these, and they got bigger cans for better and deeper sound.  keep in mind, this is a review from an honest person who enjoys music, and loves to feel the beat, i am not an "audiophile" nor do i ever want to be cause all the "audiophile" reviews i have trusted have deceived me. So enough BS, these straight up are a waste of money, they sound flat and bad, and are not worth a look.

$REVIEW.: I bought this wireless router because my old Netgear WGR614v2 has some issues with my Motorola SB5100.  Netgear works perfect with SBC DSL and the Altec DSL modem.Anyway, I got this 3com router for only 2 days.Let me some up pro. and con. herePro: Good firewall, "seems" working well with Motorola SB5100 cable modem, good wireless control access feature.Con: weaker Signal, need to work on this manual better and more details.So far, I see that the wireless signal is weaker than my Netgear for about 1 to 2 signal bar, based on WinXP's wireless network icon on Dell 1300 wireless card and the Linksys G USB wireless adapter.I place the 3com router at the same location as my Netgear (on room #2).  My room (room #1) right next to it, I used to get 98% or Excellent (full 5 bars) base on Linksys's monitor software and WindowsXP.  And on (room #3) which is about 30 feet away + a door + a wall, I used to get 50-70% or 2 to 3 bars or signal.This 3com router has only 20-40% or 1 to 2 bar of signal strenght.  Remember, I am talking about 802.11G connection.However, it does have it gooods.  Its firewall connection really working.  Works better an Netgear, it really block the connection from others.  Also, the "wireless control access" feature is great.  Like others, you need the MAC address on the control who can access your router.  However, many other routers need to temperary disconnect others on the router when you "apply" new device(Mac address).  this 3com would not do that.it would be too long to put all the other good and bad I found.  However, I think I address the most important aspect of it, signal strenght, firewall, and control access.  hope this help

$REVIEW.: I use this in my 2000 Accord. Fits great in my cup holder. There is a small amount of play but nothing that would make me feel as if it would fall over during normal driving. The arm is strong so when the IPad 2 is attached it doesn't sag and stays rigid. The IPad is very stable during normal driving I don't sense any vibration but I'm not watching anything on it while driving. The only concern I have is the little holder clip that holds the top of the IPad into place. It holds the IPad tightly into place but it's a hard plastic roller and I worry if it will scratch the screen in that place over time. The holder has been great and am happy with the product. Hope this helps someone out there.

I've had this running for about 6 months now with zero issues
Just make sure you calculate how much power your device needs delivered via the Ethernet connection as there is a limit, and you don't want to push it


I'm using about 7.5w per port (two ports), well within the limits of this machine (30 watts max), so I can't vouch for a power draw that is higher than that.

A stand was necessary, but as I was trying avoid bulk by a case entirely, getting a bulky stand didn't fit my needs either. This stand is slim and light and does what it needs to do simply. It's more functional because it's so small yet functional and universal, (I appreciate that it isn't only useable with one type of kindle or tablet.).

$REVIEW.: I have been waiting for a LED HDTV which fits in my entertainment unit, highly rated by Amazon customers, and at the right price. And, I found it! I ordered this TV thru Amazon which arrived in an excellent condition and timely 5 days ago (thanks Amazon!).The picture quality is fantastic with stunning colors for HD broadcast/streaming. Picture quality is also very good for none HD, but not as great. I do agree w/ others' comments that out of the box picture does need adjustments, so I followed Jason & Big Poppy recommendations in their reviews (thanks guys!) with some minor changes and that saved me a lot of time.Based on other recommendations I decided against getting a smart TV (you will need to spend good amount of money to get a high-end smart TV with fast micro-processor in order to get a responsive one that won't frustrate you), and got this TV and Sony Network Media Player (NSZ-GS7), or so called Google TV.Using a HMDI cable, I connected my AT&T; TV converter to Sony (of course, I also do have WiFi thru AT&T;); and use another HMDI cable to connect the Media Player to this TV. I also connected the optical output of Sony to my Denon audio receiver. It took me 10 minutes to connect everything, 15 minutes to setup the Sony Google TV box, and 5 minutes to setup the TV.Now, I have an amazing high quality video/audio setup.I am not a couch potato and normally don't watch too much TV, but this setup is addicting:-) And, I have only been busy with YouTube, and NetFlix.Speakers for this TV is adequate, but if you can enhance it as I did, will give you much better experience and makes it as great as the video quality this TV will provide you. I highly recommend this TV because of picture quality and price!

I use it with SGP iPhone 4 Screen Protector Steinheil Ultra Series [Ultra Oleophobic].The flash works great with this case
The volume buttons are not hard to press and they click
The power button is not hard to press, it just doesn't click


If you press it, you will wake up/lock your phone without a click


If you try to get a click from it, then you will need to push hard, but it is better to accept that without the click it works fine! This is not a drawback at all! I am actually starting to feel the click on the iPhone 3G a bit odd.

$REVIEW.: I got this product with the hope that I can use it with the SD cards and make a bootable CF card for HTPCs, as the combination is much cheaper than the native CF cards.I quickly found out that for some BIOS, the adapter is not seen by the system (Intel Atom based), thus deems unusable. For the systems that recognize the card (AMD based), it shows up as SD/CF adapter which is fine; I then proceeded with software installation which takes about 45 minutes. The card worked fine to start with, but toward the end, the installation stopped. I rebooted the system and the card was no longer seen. Powered everything off, I switched in a native CF, and everything worked again. After couple of tries, I realized that once the card got heated up, it ceased to operate. This is in a fanless system, and the CPU temperature is only 50C. At first I thought my SD card is not suitable for hot environment, but the spec of the SD card is for -25C to 85C, and the fact that a native CF card functions fine in the slot led me to believe that the adapter is not fit for the embedded environment where temperature may get above 50C.Other than the embedded PCs, I used it is a reader of a PC as a storage device, and it functions fine there.

With this antenna, up a little higher and pointed in exactly the same direction, we lost green on one of the majors and saw several of the other local stations lose green as well.Besides that, there was also a missing thumb screw in the box and IMO, at more than 2X the price of an antenna by the same manufacturer that works better, this one is a loser.

Therefore, I'm happy to now have all this equipment plugged into one power strip (a more obvious everyday use than surge protection, my need for which is hopefully infrequent but certainly vital) rather than two. Frankly, it's hard to improve on the manufacturer's description--there's nothing this surge protector lacks. It's a nice sturdy unit--it does not fall over when those two tiers are full of plugs, even plugs with adaptors. I don't need the labels (grouping components by usage) but for people who do, the labels are printed on and so will never peel off. It's a win!

$review_text.: If you're looking at the Lowepro SlingShot camera bags for the first time, I will start by telling you a bit about how they are meant to be worn.  This is a backpack with a single shoulder strap.  The strap sits on your right shoulder, diagonally crosses the front of your body, and attaches to the bag again at your left side.  The idea is that you can "sling" (pull) the bag around from your back to your front without ever having to take it off.  The bag is designed in such a way that when you do this, the side of the bag becomes the top, and the main compartment and zippers are facing you for quick access to you gear.  Because of the single "across the body" strap design, the backpack will never sit perfectly straight on your back, rather at a slight angle.  To compensate this, there is a padded waist belt, which helps straighten the pack and distribute the load.The 302AW is divided into two sections; the main compartment (measuring 11.4w x 5.9d x 10.6h") being for your SLR camera (or other gear), and a smaller, top compartment for personal items.  There is also a third pouch pocket on the front for things like your wallet, keys, pens, cellphone.  In addition, there are plenty of  elasticized straps, loops, netted and zippered areas all your smaller items (like flash cards, lens filters), all designed to keep everything organized and easily accessible.  The built-in lens cleaning cloth has a use, but it cannot be removed for laundering.  Same goes for the built-in rain cover, which is a bit of a double-edged sword.  If you're caught in a sudden rainstorm, it's great that you can pull it out of the bottom of the bag, and stretch it over to protect your gear, but you will likewise have to leave it hang out, flapping in the breeze, to dry because it's stitched in.The SlingShot 302AW has ample padding in all the right places to make it comfortable to wear and to protect your gear.  Although built for photographers and intended primarily as a camera bag, on another day this versatile backpack could be used for anything, by anyone after a backpack that you don't have to remove to access.  The modular Velco spacers in the main compartment can be easily reconfigured any way you like.  I reconfigured mine to carry a 10.1" netbook, compact camera, iPod, and all the associated power and USB cables, and  still have room to spare.  It's carry-on compatible (according to the tag) so it makes a great way to organize all your essential gear for your next flight.Premium camera bag or versatile backpack, the SlingShot 320AW is an all-round winner in my book.

$REVIEW.: I ordered two of these keyboards because the prices were less expensive than Samsung's own SmartTV keyboard in addition they work with PCs and Macs
 I plug in the unifying USB receiver into an available USB slot on the back of the television and the television instantly recognized the keyboard and it worked pretty well
 Both the keys and the trackpad moved the mouse pointer on the television easily
 Some of the Fn function keys such as F7 and F8 replicate channel changing buttons, F8 brings up the television's menu
 It just takes a little trial and error to figure out what function they perform on the television.I also have a Dell Laptop with a Logitech mouse that uses an identical unifying USB receiver

 I didn't not have any problems mating the keyboard with the receiver on the laptop and the keyboard and pad worked flawlessly.The one thing about this keyboard that bothered me was the right handed shift key
 My bad really, I should have noticed the layout before ordering

 I'm a full keyboardist and the right shift key is practically useless because it is so tiny


 This keyboard would have been perfect had they decided to move the arrow keys underneath the track-pad


 There is plenty of room for the arrow keys there and it would have given more room to put a full-size right-hand keyboard


 If you type with all ten fingers, the right-hand shift key may bother you

 On the positive note, since the Samsung television works with the unifying receiver, it would seem that any other Logitech wireless keyboard with a unifying receiver would work with these televisions
 But finding a small one with a track-pad might be difficult


 For this oversight, I took away one star.By the way, the Samsung television I paired this keyboard with is a 2013 model Samsung UN55F6400 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Slim Smart LED HDTV

 A friend of mine has a 2011 D8000 series and I will bring the second keyboard over to his house and see if the keyboard works with these earlier televisions

 I'll update my review when I find out.Update 8/25/2013 ===============================I had the opportunity to try out the second keyboard on Samsung UN55D8000 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver), Samsung UN46D6400 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D LED HDTV (Black) and a Samsung UN32EH5300 32-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LED HDTV (Black)
 Of these three television sets, only the UN32EH5300 recognized the keyboard

 This leads me to believe that this keyboard will only work with 2012 models and newer and not the 2011 Samsung TV

 So  if your Samsung television has a letter "E" or  later letter in the alphabet in the 5th character position of the model number, this keyboard will likely work with your television


 If it has a letter "D" or preceding letter in the alphabet, you are probably out of luck :(I hope this helps anyone with 2011 models and earlier


 If you have a 2012, you are probably good.

$review_text.: I have had this wheel for may be a year with occasional playing, logging may be 400 hours. Now the gears are stripped and feedback is no more. It started to act up several months ago, jerking back and forth erratically when it should be still, e.g., at menu selection. Now it just whines and no more feedback.Overall the unit performed well, giving feedback and rumble when appropriate. I like using the GTI, FWD. When starting the race, the feedback lets me know whether the front tires are spinning or not. Over the rumble strips, the feedback is nice. The steering goes light over grass, etc.If you're will to take the risk of it breaking prematurely, it's fun while it lasts.

$REVIEW.: I had an olympus tough before I got this camera to replace it (I loaned it to a friend and never got it back :-(). This camera is inferior to the olympus in so very many ways. The controls are awkward. It doesn't come with a printed manual. The seal needs to be replaced on a yearly basis. It seems to have a short battery life. Everytime you turn it off, it forgets all the options you had set. If I could return it I would, but it has taken me more than 30 days to realize how much I dislike it. I have other Fuji's before, so it is not just that it is "different". Yuck.

$REVIEW.: I live at the edge of a signal teetering anywhere from zero to five bars. The Wilson Electronics MobilePro consistently boosts me up to full strength at home.I held off on my review until I could find a full-fledged, zero-reception area which I found on my last ski trip on the way to the resort. I pulled aside, plugged it in and quickly acquired a full signal!I'm not such a fan of visible wires, but it's not too bad. I neatly ran the antenna cable straight back along the roof of my Prius and down through the hatchback.The sturdy antenna has a strong magnet base. The USB wall and car adapters allow me to conveniently use the same power cable between locations, and the carry pouch keeps everything together nicely.It's safe to say that you can easily maintain a reliable signal anywhere within the MobilePro's range. If you are looking for a simple way to eliminate dropped calls while you travel and to maintain a strong signal in the home, this will definitely do the trick.

$review_text.: If you're looking for a decent camera that will give you a clear picture and good sound with no complications, this is a great camera to use! The average person who does not have a lot of time to spend learning to use a new camera will be very pleased with this. First of all its so lightweight and small- I can fit it into the smallest compartment of a bookbag. But it also gives you easy menu options by using a touch screen- you simply touch and click the settings on the camera using the interface and you are able to scroll right  on the LCD screen. Its really like having a digital camera you use for pictures only it does video as well.You can choose to store your videos either on your SD card, or on the hard drive of the camera. But I do recommend using the SD card for your settings. You can adjust the lighting and quality of your picture. I was skeptical about the sound quality of the camera because it is a completely digital model- however the sound is very crisp and clear and using it outside, I did not even have trouble from the wind.The only downside to the camera is that it does not do as well in very dark rooms, or if you're filming something on stage with only stage lights. The clarity is not quite as good. However, it can get some decent night shots of outside if there is enough lighting. I use this camera as a musician to film music videos, record gigs, and film short music videos. It really is so easy to use and its just a nice little camera that gets the job done for a person that likes to upload videos to sites such as youtube, etc. This is ideal for someone who wants quality picture,  but simplicity in use.

$review_text.: Headphones and ear buds are tough to review.  The problem, of course, is that different people like different sound qualities.  For example, I like the flattest, most natural response possible. I used to be a recording engineer and producer, so hearing something as close as possible to what the musicians end engineers intended is important to me.By that standard, the Klipsch S2's are not my first choice.  While at first listen they sound quite good, I found them to be a bit bright with some content, and at this price point the Altec Lansings I have sound a bit better.  But don't let that dissuade you; for the most part there's very little to complain about, and there are other important factors to consider.Like comfort: the S2s are extremely comfortable, and I can wear them for extended periods of time with no problem.  They come with three different sized ear tips to fit most ear canals and provide the tight seal so critical to good bass response, which the S2s deliver admirably.Other relevant factors include labeling: many ear buds or in-ear monitors are not clearly marked right and left - the S2s are.  They also seem to be very well constructed, less noise is transmitted down the headphone wires than with other headphones of this type, and they come with a convenient snap open soft bag to carry them in.Overall, these are a very good choice. If you don't mind giving up a bit of accuracy to get an extremely comfortable set of headphones that still sound quite good, give the S3s a long look.  You'll be glad you did.

Lack of original packaging indicates counterfeit product or an open item.  The card would not work as it was not recognized by two seperate computers.  It also heated up to over 100 degrees before I removed it from my computers to prevent damage.  Yes, I measured the temperature with a guage after I noticed the the card was hot to the touch.

I have installed one of these on the last two units I've owned and they have work flawlessly.Yes you have to run power to the camera and coax cable to the cab but when you consider the cost difference over a wireless system, I saved about $700 for a days work.These cameras make backing solo into camp sites a very easy task,  and it's also good to see if alouf people are walking behind your rig (as they will do) as you try to back down (had this Happen).I found it reassuring to see out the back when changing lanes during heavy traffic but fundamentally rely on mirrors, it just a good back check.A small 6 to 7&#34; monitor works great on the dash to make the system complete.

$review_text.: This is my first GPS

I am appalled at the almost total lack of directions for the unit


The very small booklet purporting to tell you how to use it is a joke


It never mentions for example, how to turn it off


After four hours of playing around with it alone and hooked up to my computer, I finally got the firmware updated and also the maps

But, that was no thanks to Garmin---only because I have some knowledge of computers

I tried to call customer support when the unit locked up while installing the firware update, but the wait time was an hour

This is a joke
Whomever wrote the instruction book assumed the user knows all about these things and how to hook them up, etc


Wrong!! All in all, the unit seems to be of value and use to me in traveling, but I suggest anyone buying a GPS for the first time should talk to someone who has one already and get some tips and the name of another company who makes these things
I would NOT recommend Garmin, no matter how good their GPS units are, based on their level of customer (non)support and user instructions.Also, I cannot recommend any Garmin GPS due to their high charge for map updates

You get one initially and then must pay something like $80 after that

Tom Tom GPS units give you FREE map updates which makes that brand a much, much better deal

I am now in the market for a new GPS after a couple of years and will never buy a Garmin again.

$review_text.: Okay, let me tell you, I'd had it with Microsoft products. I mean, really really had it. Had it so bad that I had been painstakingly switching everything I could to either webware or open-source software. It was better, but still all of my Windows-based laptops have been major pains; so when Microsoft acquired (and promptly trashed) my main connection to the world (Skype) that was absolutely the last straw.Knowing there was no way on my low fixed income I could ever buy anything other than a cheap tablet, I started shifting my thinking toward cloud-based computing. I got things lean and mean. I set up free cloud storage and put my most important files (books our small press has on CreateSpace and KDP) online. I even ditched my PC-based email for Gmail on the web. I made a major commitment to undergoing a huge learning curve, in other words, and to breaking my entrenched Windows habits.Then my incredible, wonderful, thoughtful, generous, thoroughly amazing sister bought me this MacBook Pro and installed her remaining legal Adobe CS5 on it! She then turned me loose with "Macbeth," as I named it ("Beth" for short). Soon I had Mac versions of all my other important software installed, all butYou Need A Budget (YNAB) - Personal Finance Software(an awesome program I cannot afford to repurchase in Mac format). I soon found mint.com, and that did the trick in the financial department.What can I say? I love it. Love it love it love it. Everything is better, faster, quieter, easier, prettier, sexier. The keyboard is a little stiffer than I've been used to, but it's loosening up with use. The screen has a mirror-glass finish, which I'm not sure I like, but if I have the lighting adjusted properly in the room, I don't notice it.I LOVE that this laptop does not get hot; it's just a little warmish on the bottom, unlike my PCs which got frightfully hot. The only time I'm aware at all of anything going on in the system is when I've got a CD in the drive. Then it's "rackety," if you know what I mean, and I'm not entirely convinced that's the way it's supposed to be. (I haven't put any CD in the drive with any kind of stuck-on label on it, and I would strongly advise against doing that.) The battery holds up really well so I can take Beth in to the living room when I'm watching TV at night and not worry about running out of juice before bedtime.I LOVE the trackpad. It is large, and you can tap anywhere on it to effect movement. The gestures are easy to learn (like single-finger tap for left click, double-finger tap for right-click, and three-finger dragging if you've set it up that way in your preferences), and I feel like I'm in training for the tablet I'm going to have one day. The only thing that isn't faster/easier than using the mouse is quickly moving the cursor from one side of the screen all the way to the other side, which sometimes involves lifting my finger and then re-dragging. There may be a trick to click-and-drag I haven't figured out yet, but when I'm trying to click-and-drag for any distance, it's more difficult than when using a mouse. As with Windows, there is a way to disable the trackpad if you are using a mouse, but unlike with my PC-based trackpads, this Mac trackpad does not often respond when I brush across it while typing so I leave it active.Here's what I haven't gotten used to yet:The Command keys are placed on either side of a very narrow-width spacebar, so hitting the equivalent of Ctrl-C, Ctrl-S, etc., is very difficult. Unless I can train myself to hit Command with the thumb on the opposite side of the keyboard from the "s" or "c" or "x," or "z," I don't think I'm going to be able to touch-type the Mac equivalents for commands I've used without thinking in Windows. So I'm having to be overly conscious of the keyboard now.The Delete key on the Mac is really the Backspace key from Windows; there is no Delete key. Maybe there is a way to delete a character to the right of the cursor as easily as pressing the Delete key in Windows, but I haven't discovered it yet. I did discover that Command-Right Arrow goes to the end of the line and Command-Left Arrow goes to the start of the line, so there are probably other keyboard shortcuts I just have to find and learn.The Mac, like Windows, has many of its own keyboard shortcuts, but I had to go hunting online for what the cryptic symbols for the various keys are...only to keep forgetting them. Which makes me wonder why Apple could not have put the iconic representation on the major keys like it did with the Command key. They have printed "alt" on top of the Option key, which will help Windows users making the transition, but the Mac symbol for Option is not on the key. Maybe there's a way to pop up a graphic representation of a key, but I haven't found it yet.I set my Dashboard to the left and adjusted the size so my desktop feels familiar to me. I'm a bit frustrated that I don't quite understand the file structure yet, and I'm still trying to get used to the placement of the in-focus program's menu. But this is a learning curve I'm committed to going through, because it's worth it to me to be able to get away from Windows.All this is to say that, if you are a Windows user considering making the switch, the price is now right to do it, but you're probably going to want a good book. These have been recommended to me by a very knowledgeable person on the Apple forums:Mac OS X Lion: The Missing ManualMac OS X Lion Bibleand also the Switch 101 at Apple's Home/Support.I am really happy with this baby.

$REVIEW.: I spend at least 10 hours a day typing on computers and have used everything from the old, mechanical-switch IBM keyboards up to fancy split keyboard designs
 But I'm not one of those keyboard snobs who believes you have to spend north of $100 to get a decent keyboard


 All I'm looking is for something that feels good to my fingers and is easy to type on.This keyboard has square &#34;chiclet&#34; keys with a cheap, flimsy feel annoying plastic sound to the keys, and there are no legs on the back of the keyboard to tilt it up slightly
 Given the fact that the Microsoft 200 and Logitech K120 wired keyboards cost the same or less and have a much better feel and sound, I suggest either of those options over the AmazonBasics  product.I'm not going to bother returning the AmazonBasics keyboard
 For $13 it is worth hanging on to for times when I need an extra keyboard
 But I bought another Logitech K120 to use as my main keyboard.

When I bought mine, It was in BB and cost around $500.Things you will like:  The large array of features such as the built in camera, video record, wifi, and of course the fact that it runs genuine Android operating system that gives you the ability to download tons of new applications from the Google Store. There is even a Kindle application so you can download ebooks from Amazon :).The tablet itself is very high quality. It does not feel cheap or flimsy like many tablets do.Things you may not like: The tablet is HEAVY. It weight a bit over a lb, which doesn't seem like too much until you're laying on your back in bed trying to hold it like a paperback book. Your arms and wrists will hate you for it.I also didn't care for the power charger. On a high end tablet, you'd almsot expect a microUSB charger, but instead it was just a single prong and reminded me of the one that came with my 10 year old $20 tracfone.

$review_text.: SandForce-based SSDs are dominating the SSD market right now, because of their terrific read/write performance. Buggy firmware in the early-going, gave a lot of SSD manufacturers, big-time PR headaches. The good news is, SandForce seems to have finally remedied the bugs that reacquainted a lot of Windows users with the blue screen of death (BSOD).PROS:- Comprehensive upgrade kit- Gorgeous drive- Great performance- Great website support- Backed by a 3-year warrantyCONS:- Firmware can only be updated in WindowsThe Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit is a SandForce-based SSD, that performs similarly to other SandForce SSDs--wicked fast. What is different about the HyperX SSD, is the sharp, visual aesthetics and the killer bundle in the upgrade kit.UNBOXINGThere's no question that Kingston paid special attention to the packaging. Unlike many SSDs, the HyperX SSD comes in a high-quality box with foam inserts that protect the contents. The packaging is so nice, that you might want to actually keep it as a storage box for spare 2.5-inch drives.Upon opening the lid of the box, you see the beautiful blue HyperX SSD drive in a foam insert. In the underside of the foam insert, is the desktop adapter plate. Beneath that, you'll find another foam insert with the external enclosure and screwdriver. Also included is a USB cable for the external drive enclosure, blue SATA III cable, mounting screws and a software CD that includes a bootable-only version of Acronis True Image cloning software.UPGRADE KIT* Desktop adapter plateThe blue 2.5-inch to 3.5-inch adapter plate is a nice-to-have, if you ever plan on using the HyperX SSD with a desktop computer. Many newer ATX computer enclosures, like the Corsair 600T, now include drive trays that support 2.5-inch drives, but in just case your enclosure doesn't, having the adapter is a nice convenience. Buying an adapter on your own would run you about $10, but it wouldn't match your HyperX SSD with the cool blue color or have the logo.* ScrewdriverThe magnetized screwdriver matches the blue HyperX color of the drive and includes two small driver bits (one flathead and one philips). It's not the highest quality screwdriver, but for those that find the branding to be cool (like me), the screwdriver is a great addition. An almost identical, but unbranded screwdriver, can be found at discount stores like Big Lots, for about $10.* External USB drive enclosureThe USB enclosure is a fantastic way to migrate your current system to the new drive, especially for laptops. Laptops don't generally have multiple SATA ports like desktops, so without the USB enclosure, you'd have to connect both the HyperX SSD and the original laptop drive, to a desktop system to clone. Using the USB enclosure, I was able to easily clone a mechanical drive inside a MacBook Pro to the HyperX SSD. The USB enclosure is made out of plastic, which is fine for solid-state drives, since they give off much less heat than mechanical drives. Besides, its primary function is to use it temporarily for migration purposes. I wouldn't recommend using it with a mechanical drive as a permanent external drive, because of its lack of cooling properties. Similar enclosures sell for about $10-$15.* Acronis cloning softwareThe software CD includes a version of Acronis True Image that you can use to clone entire drives or image and restore individual partitions. It's not the full version that you install, but a boot-only version that lets you do most of the vital cloning and backup operations when installing or migrating drives. The full retail version of Acronis True Image costs about $30. Acronis True Image does not support Macs, so Mac users should download SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner for free.The generous upgrade kit is a refreshing departure from SSDs that don't include anything but the drives. I recently spoke with a rep from Monster Digital, who are just entering the SSD market with the full force of Monster Cable's marketing machine. When I asked them how they intended to differentiate their drives, he said that their packaging and bundle would set them apart. The thing is, Kingston's already done that with the HyperX upgrade kit.PERFORMANCEThe Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD was awesome inside a current MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop, and this was before I even upgraded the firmware to the latest version (3.3.2). Boot up times were reduced significantly, programs loaded almost instantly, and it ran stable for three straight weeks. Unfortunately, the MacBook Pro's display crapped out before I could run my benchmarks. To run my benchmarks, I ended up installing the HyperX to a desktop system with native SATA III ports on a Z68 motherboard.ATTO Disk BenchmarkATTO tests the raw performance of a drive and is the benchmark tool normally used when manufacturers advertise read/write performance.The HyperX 120GB SSD achieved max read speeds of 559MB/s and max write speeds of 518MB/s.CrystalDiskMarkCrystalDiskMark is a commonly used benchmark that can test performance of drives using random, incompressible data. Using incompressible data to measure performance can reveal the benefits of the faster, synchronous NAND flash, that the HyperX SSD uses. Many value-oriented SSDs use slower, asynchronous NAND flash.Read performance was exceptional at 489MB/s. SSD drives that use asynchronous memory can't keep up with the HyperX when using incompressible data. Write performance on the HyperX 120GB SSD was good as well (161MB/s), but the difference wasn't as pronounced as it was in read performance.SUPPORT & WARRANTYThe Kingston support website provides a good bit of information on the HyperX SSD. You can download the install guide, a data sheet, and recent firmware revisions. Beyond that, the website also has a good FAQ section and a form you can fill out for support questions. Kingston warranties the HyperX SSD for 3 years.CONCLUSIONThe Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit is a very attractive bundle. Its high-end performance, visual appeal, and matching accessories, make the HyperX stand out. Gamers and performance enthusiasts should be extremely happy with the HyperX SSD upgrade kit. At about a $15 premium over the standard HyperX 120GB SSD, the upgrade kit is well worth the cost difference. If you're looking for a sweet-looking SSD with sweet performance to match, take a look at the Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit.* Review unit provided by Kingston

$review_text.: I just installed this Express card and it works great. I also have the StarTech ECUSB3S254F USB 3.0 card that looks almost identical but costs three times more. I had to upgrade the firmware in the StarTech card and search for the drivers. to make it work. This new express card worked out of the box using the drivers that I used for the StarTech card. It did take over two weeks to get here from China. I am using it with two 2.5 inch external USB 3.0 drives and discovered that you must use the little external USB 2 power cable that plugs into a spare USB 2.0 port on the laptop and the small power pin that goes into the edge (between the two USB 3.0 ports)  on this Express card.

 It will also accept SD cards up to 64 GB which is very convenient, especially if it is used for different purposes (personal, business) or by different people


 This also reduces the amount of time spent re-transferring the same files.The apps work okay but I prefer to transfer the file and then use the native video playback software on the portable devices
 The Android app is available on Amazon here:SanDisk Connect Wireless Media Drive App.This drive is especially handy for traveling

$REVIEW.: So, I don't think you can put protection on a screen and have the same appearance no matter what you do
 So the question becomes, what is your goal, and what are the benefits of the item you choose?Ultimately, I want to use my Kindle without interference, and I want to view the screen while protecting it from scratches and wear


 I also want my screen protector to look nice and LAST!This was the EASIEST screen protector install I have ever done


 The "Sticky" part is only around the outer edge (where the black is)

 The rest of the protector just floats on your screen, so there is NO WAY to have those annoying bubbles.I have this same protector on another device as well, and have used it for a few months, NO SCRATCHES at all!  No bubbles, no distortions..


I really could go on

 Love them both and both look great.I sort of expected my Kindle to not respond to touch as well, but if anything, I think it responds better than it did without the protector, which I don't understand.I haven't tested the wash feature, but the instructions say that you can wash this screen protector by removing it and running it under water with a tiny bit of dish washing liquid
 Then you let it dry and reapply it.

$REVIEW.: I'm not new to the realm of home theaters.  I've been around some pretty nice systems growing up and 2 of my friends to this day have invested in home theater systems that cost close to the $10,000 range.  I've always been envious of their systems and told myself, when I have the money to throw around, I'll buy one comparable to theirs.  Well... to this day I still don't have that money to spend.For decades I've been living with "built-in TV speakers" on all my TVs.  Even when I bought my 55" Samsung a few years ago, I watched TV & movies on that thing using the poor man's sound.  My wife pleaded with me to get a home theater system and wanted me to buy one of those "home theaters in a box" or a soundbar.  I refused not because those systems are bad (some are actually quite good), but because I felt that if we just saved a little bit more, I could get a high end system like my friends'. She threatened me periodically, that she was going to surprise me one day. I didn't believe her because in my household, I'm typically the one who buys electronics (she knows this). That's when she did it... she surprised me last Christmas with aSamsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar.I was surprised on two fronts. The first, that she actually bought a decent one. The second, that it actually sounded pretty good with my Samsung TV.  I was satisfied until she wanted to upgraded our TV.  So long story short, we bought a newer TV but didn't use the Samsung soundbar with it.  We relocated the soundbar and Samsung TV to another room.  But over time, we found ourselves watching TV on the Samsung despite the Vizio being BETTER visually.  We realized it was because of the sound.  We were so used to the soundbar, we didn't like watching TV on the Vizio, despite the better picture.  That's when I told her I was going to buy a soundbar for the Vizio.So looking around, I stumbled across this Vizio soundbar system.  What caught my eye was the fact that it was a 5.1 system.  Very few soundbars out there (especially the top ones) utilize satellite rears.  Because of that, I pulled the trigger on this soundbar system.  All I can say is WOW x 10000000000000000.SETUP:Easy as cake. Unboxed 2 satellites, the soundbar, and the subwoofer.  Being conditioned by other electronics manufacturers, I assumed I had to buy all the cables necessary for connection.  Not the case and I applaud Vizio for this.  ALL cables are included!!!  I didn't want to mount the soundbar (rather place it on the TV stand with the Vizio).  Plugged up the optical (Toslink) cable to the TV and the soundbar.  Plugged the power up.  Then plugged the sub in the back, connected the two satellite speakers.  Pressed power on the remote...then BAM.  Instant aural pleasure.  According to the instructions, the sub is automatically sync'd at the factory and this was the case for me.  But if you find that your sub isn't working, then do the factory reset (per the manual's instructions).EQUIPMENT QUALITY:Not cheap whatsoever.  Everything is well-built.  Nothing is flimsy or seems like it will break.  The remote is very nice with the LCD display directly on it.  More importantly, the remote is SIMPLE!  Not too many buttons to confuse you.  Unlike my Samsung soundbar with the LCD display, you don't have annoying lit letters glowing in front of you while you watch the TV.SOUND QUALITY:Really amazing... I haven't experienced REAL surround sound in a while in my house (previous on my computer with a 4.1 system) and this definitely fits the bill and then some.  Bass is boomy enough to feel it yet isn't enough to blow your house down (like my friend's sub). The surround sound envelops you and the audio quality is great for such a system.  What's really awesome is that it supports DD5.1 and DTS Digital surround sound.  No downmixing problems!On a side note, it also supports bluetooth audio.  While I don't use this much (I don't listen to music on my phone), my wife adores her playlists on her iPhone.  We sync'd this sucker to her phone and it was an instant party.  Awesome for those who hosts parties, has get-togethers, or just want to listen to music with great sound.OPTIONS:There are lots of options to tweak the soundbar but it's not so complicated where you feel like you're reading some kind of physics equation.  All settings are programmed via remote and the LED indicators on the actual soundbar itself will light up telling you what setting you have currently set based on the category you select on the remote.  For example, say you want to adjust the subwoofer level.  You browse to it on the remote, then use the left or right buttons and the soundbar has these LEDs that light up showing you the current setting.  All this stuff is explained in the manual if you want more details.FINAL OPINION:No, this won't rival those multi-thousand dollar sound systems but if you're on a budget and considering increasing the quality of your audio, I seriously suggest looking into this specific model.  As of writing (12/3/2013), this (the 42") is the 2nd best one Vizio makes.  The better one is newer and it was actually JUST released (there was a commercial for it on TV).  That one is the 54" model.  Either way, I'm truly impressed with soundbar and would recommend it to anyone.  It's so impressive, my wife can't stop raving about how great it is.

$review_text.: I thought I was buying a bigger bag

this bag is very slim and probably can't even hold a mouse or the power cord comfortably


I would not recommend this unless you have a computer that doesn't need a power cord (which I think is no one)


The pockets are very tight and I would only imagine putting just paper in there.I am only keeping it because it is the only thing I have right now and other bags are so expensive

I realllly want to return this item..

I guess a few positives is that it seems like a sturdy bag
I like the shoulder strap
I will probably just use it as a laptop carrying case.

$review_text.: I got this adapter to replace my previous D-Link DWA-130 (which was also great). The reason for the upgrade is I also upgraded my router to the LinkSys E3200 and wanted to take advantage of the 5 ghz band of the router. I'm running Windows 7  and the setup was a snap. Although it wasn't plug n play (I had to install the drivers with the CD) it was simple enough and I have had 1 week solid uptime with 300 Mbps. Very pleased.

It works exactly as it should

The packaging is neat and professional, it includes a screwdriver (so you don't have to dig around to find one for the small mounting screws) and a manual, though it's pretty straight forward.Not much else to say - which is a good thing when you're describing a hard drive enclosure

It strips all the lows and sounds harsh.o The remote is small and very hard to find when you first get the projector, but it is there.o There is no lens cap, so the lens quickly collects dust.o There is no lens cap, and there is no one touch standby on the projector so you need to use the remote to invoke standby mode. This is especially inconvenient if you are showing powerpoint or videos from a USB drive (instead of an attached computer) because turning off the projector (to make it dark when you aren't using it) resets the presentation and you have to walk through the file tree again to restart it from the USB drive. Instead, I keep the projector running and block the light with a book or other object. Not ideal.PROS:o Brighter than I was expectingo Quiet (compared to the Epsons I've had)o Smallo Lighto Cool lookingo I have the peace of mind of knowing the bulb won't blow out on this presentation and leave me stuck.o I won't have to look all over the universe for a replacement bulb in a year or two, then decide whether it is worth it to replace the bulb or the whole projector.

$review_text.: I am both pleased and disappointed
It is generally a good buy, but here are both sides of the story:Pros: Nice, small and not so bad 720p video
Fast turn on and lightweight


Fast download and easy to download videos or photos in any operating system - Linux, Mac OS X and Windows

Good in low light
Refurbished, but looked like new, so no complains there.Cons: The biggest one is - only 4GB of memory

Wouldn't hurt to add a MicroSD slot, knowing how small things can be nowadays


Touch buttons not so well designed - you can change your setup for the current shoot by accident if you don't lock (which I'm sure most of the people don't)

Zoomed videos are with very low quality, so forget about digital zoom -- could have at least interpolate a bit before saving the pictures


Same for the still shooting - no zoom is recommended
Generally the quality of shooting is comparable, but not better to some of the cameras in the latest smart phone

I got it for a good deal, but the original price vs


quality is too high


The controls are not so intuitive and scattered acros the camera, which makes it difficult to react when you need to quickly change settings


And lastly the push buttons are not working 100% of the time - sometimes pushed once (kind of hard) I need to repeat to get things going


Maybe I should have tried a Flip?

$REVIEW.: The battery arrived, ahead of schedule, I'm getting accustomed to receiving what I have ordered before I'm told to expect it.  Thanks.As for the battery, by the time I finally got around to ordering it, and the shipment time, it arrived exactly on time.  My OEM battery would last just about long enough to boot the computer.  After following the directions and charging the new battery fully.On my maiden voyage with the computer on battery alone, I got about 3.5 hours.  Ir ran until the laptop shut down, and then I charged it fully.  The next time I got about 4.5 hours.  Plenty long enough to last through the full length of a VFW monthly meeting.  I'm up to about 5 hours on the battery, then I've had enough laptop time before I decide to move onto doing something else.  I have used it on-and-off for most of a full day at home and still haven't killed the battery.I'm impressed with the time from order to receipt of the battery, the service I've been experienced with the new battery.  If this isn't enough for you, it's significantly LESS EXPENSIVE than the battery that is  available from the manufacturer, with a higher MAH rating.Thanks for the battery, it's the Wolf's Howl.

Yes, the Dimension 2400's came with only 128mb running XP - it took 2 years to figure out that was why my mother-in-law's computer ran at 1/10th proper speed, because she paid at least two different "professional" computer people $60/hr to "help" her.  I never imagined that Dell was so low as to sell a dog like this at SAM's Club, and that the "professionals" had never checked the RAM.  Having a total of 640mb now, it runs like a brand new system.

$review_text.: Bottom Line: Don't buy this iteration of the PowerBook - (...). On paper the specs are great. But, as several posters have said there are two huge problems with this PowerBook which Apple refuses to acknowledge let alone fix!First, there are profound issues with the audio. The audio skips and stutters randomly. I know I'm not the only one experiencing this difficulty. Apple has issued a Knowledgebase document on this issue [...]  But the solution - if one can call it that - doesn't work and essentially implies this machine is seriously crippled in its ability to multitask. When I've called AppleCare they either deny the existence of the problem or have no solution.Second, there are profound issues with the screen. Apparently, there is horizontal banding of every second or third pixel row over the entire screen. Each pixel row is darker or lighter than it's neighboring pixel rows. This is a well documented seemingly ubiquitous issue over the entire line of new 15" PowerBooks and again a problem that Apple does not acknowledge.It appears some people have sent the computer in to AppleCare for repair for this issue and it was returned without any repair done the technicians claiming that the problem is "WITHIN SPEC" meaning that the screen is within the model specifications and that it is not a problem or they are shipped a replacement which exhibits the same problem.If you still feel like gambling on one the good news is Amazon has a great return policy so if you have one or both of these problems Amazon will take it back.

$review_text.: I bought the MinoHD (model M2010M).  8GB model  (built-in battery)(There are several generations of these flip camcorders and I think this one is "III" or "generation 3", as it has the flip out USB connector which is new.)Specs are great and while I agree with most of the positive reviews, this is a simple, but powerful camcorder, suitable for sharing with someone who has never seen one before.My gripe - Bad Batteries. The batteries were dead on both of the units I bought.  Even after charging 12 hours, they were still in a very low state.  Eventually, each one turned on, but only long enough to show me a "low battery" message and then it went black again!I noted they sell separate chargers, which I recommend.  Some computers turn off the power on their USB ports when they go to sleep, so you may have to keep you computer "awake" to get a full charge.I also tried an iPad USB charger, to no avail?!The official chat site has a few complaints about difficulty charging these things.But, like I said, for the one camera that I finally got up and running, it was a delight!  It took 18 seconds of video and shutdown with "low battery" warning.I own two other large mini-DV type video tape cameras and their only major difference is having a 20X zoom lens.  These little things are fun for conferences, speeches, awards, and wedding comments.  Since you don't have to hold it up to your face, it's much easier to interact with people, pets or even just framing shots.  The image stabilization works wonders; sound quality is great indoors.  But, they have some QA problems with these built-in batteries to work out.There is another version that has removable batteries, which is cheaper, too.

I purchased the item through one of the &#34;warehouse deals&#34; and it was used or &#34;repackaged&#34;. I never figured out the problem, but it appeared that the driver program which was supposed to be installed internally in the device was not present. In any event, my computer could not &#34;find&#34; or recognize the device as it was supposed to do, and I could not get it installed. As a result, I sent it back, and quickly received a full refund, including the postage spent on the return.

I agree with others that using the Pro setting seems to make the reception better

 I did notice in areas some static and touching the unit made the static go away


 Since I did not want to drive with one hand on it, I leaned a small metal rod on the unit that I just happened to have in the front seat
 It had the same affect as my hand, but a lot safer

 I will keep some metal wire under the seat and lean it against the unit if I hit some static again.

$review_text.: I really hate to give these just 2 stars since they were so highly recommended by MKBHD, but I have to. I wanted to love them, but I became increasingly frustrated with use. I use ear buds nearly all day at work, and also while weight training roughly 4 days a week.The main issue I had with these is that I just couldn&#8217;t get a comfortable seal. I tried several combinations with the provided earpieces, but they were constantly loosening up or slipping out of my ears entirely. When I did get them in the right spot, the sound was good, but not great. I tried both the behind the head configuration and the traditional setup. Behind the head really isn&#8217;t practical for weight training since pretty much anytime I laid the back of my head on a bench or a machine they got tugged out of my ears.The other gripe I had was the connectivity issues with my iPhone 5. When I had my phone in my pocket, the music would skip with each step I took. I had to hold my phone in front of me to keep the sound from breaking up; this seems like a disaster for runners. I can&#8217;t entirely say this is the JayBirds fault, but I&#8217;ve never had any Bluetooth issues with my iPhone in the past.While adjusting the volume, it cuts the sound out for a split second every time you push the button.  More of an annoyance than anything, but it gets a little difficult to hear how loud the music will be without a tone.I packed these up and returned them to Amazon a week after trying them out. I can see how these would be a great product for someone with better Bluetooth luck and a decent fit, but for almost $150 it just didn&#8217;t make sense for me. I&#8217;m still on the hunt for the perfect pair of earbuds.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera to use as a barn cam to view my cattle while they are calving.  It arrived in good condition and installation was tricky but acceptable for someone with computer/network experience.  The IP Camera Tool software that comes with the camera is useful for obtaining the IP address.  It is necessary to have DHCP enabled on your router for the tool to locate the ip address.  The IPCamClient software that came with the camera is good and allows up to 64 cameras to be attached, and port forwarding to view the camera remotely.  There are only 9 preset positions, but otherwise it works well.  I found an updated software version on the web that worked better than the version on the disk, which seemed to have some glitches.  The picture quality is quite good when there is adequate lighting.  Daytime viewing is in color which is accurate, but night time switches to b/w.  The IR led lights around the housing cast a limited amount of light in total darkness, but seem to help when there are some lights on.  The zoom is a useful feature but could be higher power.  Auto focus, white balance, and iris function are good. PTZ control is good wired but a little jumpy when used wireless.  Once you have your presets set it works well.  I have tried this camera in two locations.  The first was outside mounted on a yard light pole.  Daytime viewing was good, but nighttime was not bright enough.  The second location is in a 40X80 calving barn.  With several lights left on this camera is working well, but in total darkness you will only see shadows up to about 20 ft.  I purchased a Loftek camera after this one because it looked identical and was cheaper, but the picture quality has not been as good.  Overall, this is a good camera for daytime use and with supplemental lighting.  The lens is good quality and the camera seems to be well made.  It has been operating for about a week.  I will update after I have used it for a longer time.
$review_summary.: Good quality picture for daytime or with supplemental light.

$REVIEW.: They package it extremely well.  I love this product!  It's crystal clear and easy to apply.  It's great that they give you two of them, but I'd be shocked if you actually needed the second one.This was not the first screen protector I got for the Asus T100.  I had first received the Skinomi one.  While it had an outstanding carbon fiber skin for the back of the T100, the screen protector was garbage.This iLLumiShield screen protector is one of the best I've ever used.  I plan on checking for iLLumiShield if I ever need to buy a screen protector for another device.

$REVIEW.: I returned this Keyboard today


I needed an illuminated quiet wireless keyboard with a touchpad
This isn't it

Although the keys don't stick, if you are not within line-of-sight of the receiver, any and all keys appear to stick

I even resorted to using an external USB power supply but it was no help


I am laying 3 feet from the computer, but if I let the keyboard fall below line-of-sight with the receiver it begins to fail badly..


The touchpad is not functional and keys appear to stick or just don't respond at all.I believe I read something about a 30 meter range


That is one serious lie

I am bedridden so the features that this KB offered sounded perfect for me


It actually would be perfect IF it worked

My spouse may be laying in bed asleep beside me so the features are exactly what I need


Sad that it doesn't work as advertised..

Buyers beware!

$REVIEW.: I was looking for another bluetooth keyboard to go with my laptops. I've started converting all of my dedicated 'tower' based machines to laptops as my requirements on specificity of hardware have gone down (and frankly the capabilities of laptops have gone up). I tend to have one dedicated laptop running previously a dual boot (but it's easier to run virtual machines on the newer fast quad cores) for work and gaming, I retired my old gaming box to take over for my *nix based server and I also have a dell 'duo' tablet I use as a little-bit-of-everything from a small portable laptop to a reader, alarm clock, media server, media player, photo frame, you name it!I picked up a microsoft 6000 keyboard and number pad combo off someone on craigs list a few months back and absolutely love it as a dedicated external but the problem was, it wouldn't fit in the bag I had for the duo and I kept having to re-pair it between the *nix server and my duo tablet. Thus I wanted to get another one to use for the *nix machine which I don't have to access remotely very often.I got to wondering if anyone ever did a multi-pair device and stumbled upon the various IOGear multi-links. I initially looked at one of the larger ones with the included touch pad as a possible replacement for the 6000 when at home, but I still would have been faced with the problem of the 6000 not fitting in the duo's bag. Then I saw this one. I knew the keys would be cramped, but I saw one other possible usage that just made me know I had to get it.Not only does this one fit just perfectly in my little duo's bag's front pouch, but after pairing to my three systems, I had three profiles left over. I paired one to my cell phone (and I'm actually using this keyboard more often on my phone than any of the other three machines) and another to my computer at work just for the hell of it! One of the guys at work is thinking of getting one to use with his cell phone and his playstation now.As I say, the keys are a tad scrunched but it is a far site better than the phone's keys. It comes with a nice, soft, carrying bag which comes in handy to prevent it from getting nicked up when shoving it in the laptop's bag. Because of the small footprint, there do seem to be a lot of (blue) Fn special keys that I'm still learning my way around, but some of them include the quick-launch style buttons along the function keys.Overall this is a really slick little device and I've been recommending them to all my geekier friends. Genius! Pure genius,whoever thought this one up!

$review_text.: Straight out of the box I liked this router, it was sleek and attractive as far as routers go. The speed supported was superior to the router I was currently using so I began the quick installation to start up. I went though the standard quick start steps three times and it came up with an error each and every time. I eventually just went into my computer's network settings and did it my own way and it now works great. There was an improvement in the loading time for online games and videos, but that of course had partially to do with the fact that my old router did not support the speed that this one does. I would recommend this for someone to buy, but you might need to know enough about setting these up to not follow the directions and override it yourself.

$review_text.: Normally I purchase the Apple brand Matte Screen Protector in the Apple store near my home, but the price is pretty high and you only get two screen protectors instead of three. When I saw that Belkin offered an alternative I thought I'd give it a try because I normally am extremely pleased with their products. Unfortunately this simply didn't live up to my expectations.My major concerns:- Smudged easily- Lacked the touch sensitivity I'm used to- Needed to be replaced oftenAs I said, this didn't really live up to my expectations, but it does do the job when necessary. If you don't mind replacing your screen protector every month or so and would like to try something a little less expensive than "name brand" I'd say give it a try. You may just like it more than I did, but unfortunately my expectations were perhaps set a little too high.

$review_text.: This is an very nice and compact telephoto lens, especially on DX bodies like the D300; nice and sharp even wide open and by f/4, performance is approaching world class. This lens produces sharp, high-contrast images on the D300 and bokeh is excellent, with a soft and pleasing out of focus area rendition.The lens starts to show it's age on full frame cameras however, including the D700 and especially with the D800.  Pixel level acuity is marginal on the 36MP sensor of the D800 and while downsampled images look great, the 180mm f/2.8D just can't keep up with the demands of the newer high resolution camera.  Purple fringing is on an extreme level with high contrast subjects and extends out from the edges of transition areas for 5-8 or more pixels.  I found this to be unacceptable and very distracting and therefore will no longer attempt to use the lens on the D800.  On the D700, the situation is better, though still not perfect as there is softness that never quite goes away outside the central image area, even when stopped down.Others have complained about the M/A focus mode switch, but in my opinion, the lens is a mechanical marvel considering the older design and lack of a built in focus motor. The lens is very solid and has a wonderful manual focus action - the best manual focus of any autofocus lens I own, with a very precise and positive action. Build quality is exceptionally high.  Autofocus is slower than a modern AF-S or shorter focal length AF-D lens, but totally acceptable for most shooting situations. Internal focus keeps the length consistent.Another great `feature' of this lens is its relatively small size and light weight. It is much less obtrusive (and sharper IMHO) than the 80-200 f/2.8 AF-D, making it a great high-quality carry-around telephoto. For perspective, it's about as long as the 18-200 DX VR (with hood attached) and so fits nicely in a medium sized bag.On the down side, it's a little expensive, but if you want to own a classic, and especially if you shoot a higher end DX Body (with the required built-in autofocus motor), this is it.

$review_text.: UPDATE January 2014:Thanks to information from many useful comments, a short update:1) The problem is still the same as it was. Both 2TB drives are still being sold with the same model number. Due to changes in serial nunbers, depth of the drive housing's indentation has now become the best way to distinquish the drives (see user images - bottom right of Amazon's product page)2) When I wrote this, I didn't feel up to offering an alternate drive recommendation, as my own opinion is based on personal experience and hence anecdotal. Many people asked, but I only answered in email, without adding a recommendation to the review.Since Backblaze's (an online data backup company) massive long term test, their blog and extremetech's article based on that (see comments, page 26 for a link), I'll just quote their blog: "If the price were right, we would be buying nothing but Hitachi drives. They have been rock solid, and have had a remarkably low failure rate."So, is that data even relevant for the average home user?  I would say yes, because continuous, heavy use of large numbers of drives is the only way to get any half-reliable comparison. Among consumers, usage patterns are simply spread too wide: if someone only turns on their computer 15 times a year (my aunt), any drive will be the same as any other drive, cause with so little use, they will all last till the lubricant in the spindle dries up, and she'll tell anyone who asks that her drive is great. This inability to compare reliability in the consumer space has bolstered sales of shoddy drives for a long time.If you do use your computer frequently, installing drives exhibiting a &lt;1% annual failure rate at Backblaze certainly beats installing drives with a 15% or even 120% annual failure rate.**end update**ok, so this drive is listed as the "Seagate ST2000DM001" and guess what; other than that it sports 2 Terabytes, it tells you nothing whatever about what drive you'll end up with, because Seagate has chosen to obscure and omit relevant Data between different builds with vastly different performance.The short advice: Only purchase versions xxExxxxx [and possibly x24xxxxx - x24 is unverified info so far, see notes below] of the 2TB model. This uses 2 platters and 4 heads.It performs 30% better than the version with 3 platters, which has an xxFxxxxx [or possibly x36xxxxx] designation. Avoid those!You'll need to contact the seller and ask them to check the code on the drive. If they can't verify, don't buy it, better to get a drive from a different company, where its hopefully not a surprise game of what's in the box.S - SU - Suzhou ChinaW - WU - Wuxi ChinaZ - TK - Korat ThailandF = 3 platters with either 5 or 6 heads (bad 2TB drive or good 3TB drive)E = 2 platters with 4 heads. (good 2TB drive)D = 1 platter with 2 heads.  (good 1TB drive)Weight info received in a comment here, suggests that the 'good' 2-platter drive weighs 534 grams, while the 'bad' 3-platter drive weighs 624 grams.Seagate used to embed the information about their drives in the model number, but now they obscured it, so they can pawn off whatever they want.  Send a WxE model to Publications who test drives, and then ship the crappy WxF model to unsuspecting customers who may never realize they're not getting what they thought they were buying.  This should really be illegal.....NOTE 1:  This was written for the 2TB drive.  It turns out Amazon also shows this review for 3TB drives. This info does not apply to 3TB drives, the 3TB drives always have 3 1TB platters. (or not, there have been reports of 5 platter 3TB versions, if you know anything more, let us know).NOTE 2:  comparison test results - since links get killed in reviews, I'll upload an image to the product page..NOTE 3:  A relevant post on Seagate's forum stating that these Barracuda have been crippled through redesign [see the link in comment 143 below, page 15](Apparently, links are permitted in comments).NOTE 4:  Someone commented that Seagate removed any reference to the 2 platter version of this drive in the manual (something which is usually only read after the purchase).NOTE 5:  Someone explained that Seagate made this change due to the flooding of their plant in Thailand. This is not quite correct since chinese 2 platter 2TB drives are also in circulation..NOTE 6:  While the channel still has drives with the numbering scheme as described above, there appear to be at least some drives with a new numbering scheme like "Z240PJB3". Would be great if it read out like x24xxxxx, where 2 stands for 2 platters and 4 stands for 4 heads, then this would be one of the good drives while something like x35xxxxx would be the bad drives. (this is just a guess so far, its not verified).NOTE 7:  Someone added that 2 platter drives (based on other pictures) are 'thinner' with deeper indents on the bottom and top and have a dot matrix code on the bottom right third of the top next to the label. (note that labels are not safe indicators, as they could change an older factory to add barcodes or switch to their latest labeling system any time they wish).NOTE 8:  Seagate has reacted and added more drive info on this product page, advertising "POWER OF ONE" meaning 1 platter per terabyte. This is good news, but that doesn't mean you can relax and just hit the 'buy' button:a) channel inventory of drives manufactured prior to this "Power of One" initiative will be around for some time to come, so you still need to verify.b) the specifications sheet Seagate still links on this very page (as of June 28, 2013) shows 6 heads, 3 disks for the 2TB version. With conflicting information, its still a little hard to tell for consumers if they're getting "POWER OF ONE" or "WEAKNESS OF 0.67".Once Seagate "fixes" their spec sheet info for the 2TB drive which directly conflicts with the "Power of One" advertising, I'd be happy to change my conclusion below. After all, it would mean they decided to be honest and transparent again, rather than hell bent on destroying the reputation of their 'Barracuda' brand.But right now, what is the point of advertising "Power of One" while saying their 2TB drives have 3 platters with 0.67 TB at the same time....CONCLUSION:Seagate's real reason to obscure drive information is being able to use lower bin or older tech platters that can only hold ~670 GB, so they use 3 platters.  This is a fine business decision, but an honest company would give it a new Model number/name, as its a different product with lower speeds, lower reliability and higher weight.But why be honest, if you can cheat and make a few dollars extra per drive, by selling it under the same name as the better drive, which has been reviewed extensively and lauded for its higher speeds?Last Update: June 28, 2013 (in response to Seagate's new additions to this page and with thanks to Alex and J. Goodman)

$review_text.: It tested okay, meaning it powers on and all the numbers work out. I am unimpressed with the cables. There is one set of zip ties at the end of each cable and not near the opening on the PSU. The cables were scattered everywhere and it took a short while to untangle them. That was irritating. Never have I seen any power supply arrive without the cables being properly bunched and brought together with at least a second zip tie at the base of the cables. The main board cable (largest) has a nice cable wrap on it which makes the loose cables look even worse. What a pain, and the wires are all mixed up. I do not recommend unless you are on budget and this is NOT a true 600 watt power supply. Peaks about 380.

$REVIEW.: [Final Update: As great a dock speaker as this is (I'm using it with a Classic, a Nano 3G and a Touch 2G--no inserts, or adapter, required), its sound beats the internal speakers I've heard in HDTV systems.  In fact, I picked up two more, along with a headphone splitter, and now have 2 of these babies replacing the speakers in a Sony flat screen.  Admittedly, one Athena would do, since each Athena has full, spacious, 2-speakered sound to begin with. But in these depressive times, why not go with some extravagance when it's affordable?][Update: If this speaker doesn't blow you away, you have a defective unit. Exchange it for another.  Warning: Guard the (as usual) tiny remote switch with your life, should this unit be in the process of being phased out.  I'm even having difficulty replacing the remote for a comparatively new JBL portable iPod speaker. Moreover, the remotes are disproportionately pricey, even when available.  Also, the included battery was sporadic and failed in short order.  Replace it with an Everready CR-2025, and you should notice an instant difference.  Finally, double-check the price of the Athena. This review is based on the reduced price which, curiously, is not appearing on my Profile page.  Still, seeing what a Bose or Tivoli goes for, it would be hard, imo, to "overpay" for the unit. I've just auditioned and reviewed the runaway favorite, the Altec IM600.  In short, if you can forgo the radio and a couple of other conveniences, the Athena is the better choice, the one that no doubt would be made by the goddess's celebrated "A" student, Odysseus.]If you're a musician, or (better) someone capable of distinguishing "true" musical frequencies and "honest" sonic imaging from numerous doctored, contrived approximations, you owe it to yourself to dedicate at least some portion of your precious listening space to the Athena.  This is not merely a good-sounding speaker; it's a miraculous little system stopping at nothing less than verisimilitude in its accurate and simply breathtaking representations of musical sound.  The acoustic bass that sounded distorted or boomy on other systems speaks with unmistakable human clarity on the Athena; the sonorities of the Steinway piano are rich, complex and brilliant while the less stable intonation of the Baldwin is no less identifiable, yet the inimitable touch of Bill Evans comes through equally unmistakably on both instruments; the vibrations of a Hammond B3 Leslie system are not so much "captured" as "constructed" in the listener's own space, which suddenly contains its own Leslie system. With the Athena there's no mistaking a crash cymbal with a ride cymbal or a Paiste with a Zildjian ride cymbal; or a Selmer Mark VI tenor saxophone with a Yamaha Custom.  $49.95, $149.95, $449.95, or $1495.00--merely quantitative figures, all immaterial to someone for whom music is truly important.  Listen to this speaker, and nothing less will do.  A few observations:1. Some of the reviews suggest that the Athena iVoice is basically a knock-off of the Bose Sound Dock--at a price reduction of 80% or better.  Maybe.  I think it's better.  And while coming up short in terms of style, material and build quality, the Athena is competitive (to say the least) with a Kloss Tivoli Stereo System costing 20-30 times as much.2.  The remote control is smaller than a credit card and unsophisticated--but it does all you need from the other side of the room--control volume, skip songs, turn it on.3.  The thing isn't as ugly as it appears in the photo, though the consumer should not be misled into assuming the unit is a light, thin picture frame ready to be hung on the wall from a tack or thin nail.  Since the unit comes without an external power adapter (3 cheers for Athena!), the transformer is built inside the back of the unit, which consequently  is several inches deep.  There's enough flat surface for the unit to be mounted on a wall, but plan on a couple of well-planted, sturdy screws and an overhang of at least 4 inches.  (I frankly wouldn't regard this as an ideal wall-hanging unit.  For one thing, if you lose track of that tiny remote, you'll need to reach to the top of the unit to operate the controls.)  The Athena sounds good even in open areas, but for optimal sound--especially bass--try for a corner.4.  The unit, like my factory-tuned Tivoli and unlike a twenty-dollar radio purchased at Walgreen's, has no tone controls.  Just be assured that's not a cost-cutter on the part of those who designed the Athena. Even though the unit is devoid of EQ controls (not even bass and treble) as well as a switch for "simulated" surround sound, its frequency coverage and sound dispersion are so satisfying that the aforementioned controls now seem like so many novelties and gimmicks.5.  Unlike JBL, Cyber Acoustics, and a number of other iPod players that provide the user with six or more plastic insert adapters to ensure a tight fit between iPod and dock, the Athena uses a rotating, in-and-out wheel that can be turned to accommodate players of various sizes--a simple yet effective solution.There's a reason that a number of dock-speaker systems, including this one, have been reduced in price. Most will not necessarily perform as advertised (transmitting video or synching a phone, for example) when used with newer devices such as the Nano 3G or iPhone.  Nevertheless, the Athena is currently the best deal among all such "aging" systems (and most newer ones).  The sound is so good it leaves little to no room for improvement.  (If you don't require a remote and would prefer a system that can operate on either battery or electrical power, the Cyber Acoustics CA-421 is a smaller unit that offers less volume and spaciousness but manages to be fuller-frequencied and more pleasing than similar-sized units.)Should an Athena not be in the cards, go out of your way NOT to listen to one.  Doing so will spoil you irremediably and lead to a life of unabated regret.

$REVIEW.: After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase one of these to see what all the hype was about. My plan is to wire my deck this coming spring for audio and I wanted to purchase items that were cheap enough to leave outdoors and not lose any sleep over them being exposed to the elements. I was extremely impressed with the sound that comes from the amplifier when plugged into a pair of simple two way bookshelf speakers and an iPhone. So impressed that I will be purchasing a couple more of these in the near future for other areas of my household. The 20 watt per channel output is dubious at best, but they produce an impressive amount of level even through inexpensive speakers and produces little heat due to the efficiency of the amplifier.
$SUMMARY.: Great little amplifier!

$review_text.: Darn, I really wanted this device to work. Bought a Samsung Galaxy2 10 inch tablet for travel when I don't want to haul around my laptop but just couldn't get the hang of it. A friend with an iPad had a keyboard that looks just like this and it works great so I was really hoping this would work the same.No such luck. Able to sync it and use it at home one time before getting on a plane sans laptop for 6 days travel. When I got to the hotel the keyboard was not working, tried to re-sync several times and recharged it just in case....nope.I pretty much ONLY shop at Amazon because of the FABULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! and the device will be picked up by UPS tomorrow morning.....good riddance!!!!!!!

$review_text.: I postpone all reviews until I have thoroughly tested and used the product. I can't tell you how many reviews I've read raving about a product and then you find out that they just received it. How do you review something you barely used or in some cases haven't used at all? Please people use the product and then review, or at least update your review after you have used it for a few months.Sorry. Had to say that. So the review. I have used the YN622 for about 6 months now. I originally bought 2 and after some weekend sessions (I never use untested equipment on professional gigs) I bought two more. I now have 4 total giving me 3 off camera flashes and potential a fourth on the camera. I have used these quite a bit and they have be very solid. I have had a few glitches where they wouldn't work so I switched the transceiver on my camera with the one I was using with the flash and the problem seemed to fix itself. I may have not had it completely tightened down. There have been some other small glitches, but being in the heat of the moment and trying to get a shot, sometimes I don't slow down and think about how everything is set up.These work great with the ETTL and being able to set the flash manually from the camera is pretty awesome as well as using the ETTL feature. I only shoot manually so I haven't truly tested the ETTL function, but the times I have used it it has worked flawlessly and as expected. I bought these over the other options because of the ETTL in the event that I would like to use it, but the added bonus of being able to set the flash manually from the camera is pretty awesome. I only have one ETTL flash (430EX II) and that is the only one that I can set from the camera. The others are just manual flashes and they have to be set from the flash.My one complaint is that it is really easy to hit the buttons when moving the flashes around. You can change the channel or group by accident really easily. Also the light communication method is a little confusing. One more minor nitpick is that it is really hard sometimes to unlighted the transceiver from the camera or stand. It is just hard to get my fat hands between the camera and transceiver to get a grip on the locking wheel.I would definitely recommend these especially if you have ETTL flashes and want to use that function. They have been reliable for probably around 2-4 thousand shots so far, maybe more.

Spent almost 12 days configuring it but Microsoft Technical support could not configure it with my D-Link DI-624 Super G router. They were not able to setup encryption key and was not able to detect my wireless network. Microsoft transfers their tech. support calls to Far East country like India and most Level 1 support technicians don't know much beyond simple manual reading knowledge. Worst, their manager used to call me  after midnight. Is that a time to call back??? At least they should check which time zone they are calling. And in middle of night asking my e-mail address where he can send solution?? After having their case open more than 10 days he still couldn't find my e-mail address in their database with my ticket.

$review_text.: This is my third GPS unit and easily my favorite both in style and functionality. I consider myself the average consumer when it comes to electronics in general.  Not too tech savvy, but I have the basics down.I'll get to what I like about it the least out of the way...the controls on the back.  The location of them is exactly where you hold it so I keep hitting them when I'm trying to hold it. I have to remind myself to position my fingers in a little to avoid that. That is my only real complaint on this unit and that isn't that significant, just takes some getting used to.I am really impressed with it overall. The amount of imformation and detail it contains is amazing. It is packed with features, very user-friendly (only had to consult the manual once). Perfect size, quick, great display, impressive routing accuracy (even for small towns), better-than average voice clarity. I had no problem syncing it with both of our phones.Highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I bought this alarm clock for our guest bedroom... it's the room my in-laws stay in when they come to visit.  They're older, so the large numbers on this clock are a plus.  I can see the time on this clock if I'm walking by the bedroom.  Also, it has a gentle wake feature that's very nice to have should guests decide to get up at a certain time.Simple buttons, nothing too fancy or complicated, but with a sleek overall look to it, so my mother-in-law wouldn't think I put a junk alarm clock in their room to use.  :)  At the time of purchase, it was ten dollars from amazon, so I wasn't breaking the bank for a clock I'd rarely use.I've had this alarm clock over 6 months, it's kept the time right on, and I'm quite pleased with it.  Should one of the two alarm clocks in our bedroom ever fail, I won't hesitate to confiscate this RCA Smart Snooze from the guest bedroom, and give it a permanent home on our own bedside table.

$review_text.: This thing produces a very nice image and has a reasonable operator interface.  I could not get a video to play on it.  I translated file formats till I was blue in the face and none of my files were recognized.  I tried everything and I am quite persistent.  I rarely fail at making appliances from deranged designers work at least once. No joy.  But it plays pictures very well and the pictures are wonderful.  As for the mechanical design, you can't put an SD card in and hang it on the wall.  The right angle plug hits the end of the card and doesn't allow it.  But if you're handy you can change the plug to an axial one and solve the problem.  Or use another power supply.  It is not as thin is you might like for hanging on a wall, but standing on a table, it looks great.  All said, I think it is worth the money despite the limitations.

$REVIEW.: I got these because they fit just fine on my desktop with the two laptops I have.  I connect them to my HP Pavilion or my Mac Book Pro and they sound fine and much better than the speakers in the laptops, especially the Mac Book Pro, which I thought sounded tinny and there was no bass whatsoever.  A set of 2.1 speakers with a sub-woofer would be too loud in my apartment, so I decided to look at the desktop speakers.  I have been well satisfied with my purchase.

$review_text.: This case is for sale under Pixxo name on other websites


Both look and material are very good

The case fits a full size micro ATX mb, 1 5.25" disc drive and 1 3.5" hard drive
Instruction is quite simple, 1 sheet of paper but enough for setup with some trial-and-error

Optical disc drive may use 3rd screw hole so there won't be a gap between eject switch and push mechanism on case


I use 2nd hole and put a self adhesive furniture bumper to fill the gap.The primary issue is the noisy PS unit


This can be solved some by swapping an aftermarket fan


Go buy a 2 bucks silent 80x80x25mm fan, remove the PS from case (3 screws), remove its top cover (4 screws)
You will see the PS fan uses 2 wires, red and black

Your 2 bucks fan may come with a 3-pin connector in red/yellow/black wires or an ATX 4pin peripheral connector with red and black

If it's the 3 pin, the yellow is not used and you don't need soldering
Just pop the pins and insert them to PS fan's connector
Or, you do little soldering if it's a red/black 4pin fan
Black to black, red to red
Otherwise it will short and get burnt


However, this fan swap needs to rip off the warranty sticker so 1 year warranty is no more

If you prefer not to change internal parts, google for a micro ATX PS which this case uses

SilenX has a 200W silent PS for 10 bucks.But no matter you change fan or replace the whole PS the noise is only reduced to an acceptable level, not eliminated
This is due to the air flow design of the case


Intake is on bottom and space for air flow is limited
If you want a very silent case with small footage, go with Antec NSK1380 but in some cost.Cute, not very noisy(after modify on PS), fit for standard DVD and MATX MB, low cost
Really not too much to criticize.

I needed approximately 60 feet of cable but the only offering on Amazon from this company that I found was 50 and 100 feet.  I ordered the 100 foot length.  When I went to install the antenna the instructions stated that I may need an amplifier for any length over 50 feet.  After the connection and setup my high definition reception with 100 feet was as good as what I was receiving with cable.  I only wish there was a greater selection of lengths offered on Amazon.

$review_text.: I have a Panasonic 37" LCD TV and wanted to improve the sound. Originally I purchased a Panasonic SCH-TD10 Sound bar that coordinates with it. After listening to it for a couple of years, I was still unimpressed with the sound and looked for an alternative. This sound bar had mainly terrific reviews and Klipsch is known for making terrific speakers (back in the day). I installed this and was very disappointed. The sound seemed no better. I removed it from its mount and placed it in front of my TV and alternated playing TV program sound and music from the two speakers. Other than the better base from this sound bar, I heard virtually no difference. I then did the same with the Panasonic Bar and found little difference but some improvement so I returned this bar. I'm now pretty impressed with the TV's speakers and soundThe bar had some problems as well. The AV wire that comes with it is very flimsy and didn't work. I had to use the wire from my Panasonic Bar. The remote controller would not work, occasionally, and I had to turn the bar off at the bar and turn it back on in order for the remote to work.One last feature, or lack of, which bothered me and which may be common to most bars, is that the bar has to be mounted in an open area as the remote's infra red has to be able to reach the bar's receptor. While the bar can be programmed to accept a Universal remote, it has to read that remote directly. Also, there are two volume controls, one for the main speakers and one for the sub and the universal remote has only one volume control so that you need to keep the Bar remote handy if you want to adjust the sub or other features.Since my Panasonic bar was built to coordinate with a Panasonic TV and has a cable with a connector similar to a USB cable connector, the Bar takes its commands from the TV and can be placed in more remote locations.

$review_text.: [---Quick Thought---]This Sound Bar is for those wanting an inconspicuous addition, unless it warrants itself to stand out, to boost the sound quality of your television set. When you finally decide on which TV to buy, it can sometime be a tiresome search or a quick one. However, one fact is apparent with almost any TV you buy and that is the manufacturer skimped on the audio which is appropriate for the TV manufacturer should concentrate on what they produce best--visual quality.The LG NB3530A provides much crisper and clearer sound at high outputs of volume. The latter added with nice bass to allow you to be whelmed in cinematic 'rumble'--though this could disturb a few co-inhabitants if you live in an apartment setting. Though I feel the price is a little more expensive than the quality outputs, it is a no-stress buy in that it performs well, as it should, and is extremely easy to setup out of the box without the need really to ever look at a manual. If you do not see yourself buying extra equipment to get a surround sound, or complete digital audio environment setup within your home then this all-in-one audio extension from LG is perfect for your needs and possibly all you ever need depending on your style of visual entertainment.Overall: 7.5/10Overall Rating adjusted for its Price Range: 8.5/10Ease of Setup: 9.5/10-----------------In Depth Review-----------------[---Sound---] 7.5/10-Bass: 8.5/10-Treble/Mids: 7.5/10First things to note about the LG 3530A is that it only uses digital optical outs and not HDMI. In the past, digital optical was the 'good' addition for sound output however if you are adding blu-ray and conversely HD audio, then the digital optical is not where you want your audio to be streaming from.Digital optical cannot process HD quality sound from Blu-rays. *Take this into account*. This means that you will not be getting surround sound above 5.1 (the .1 being your subwoofer so you are actually getting '6' sound channels), of course, or HD audio--whether it says so or not. Digital optical can process up to 1.5 mbps of audio whereas HDMI can do up to 20 mbps and lossless audio. Now you see the difference especially when a lot of Blu-ray audio is uncompressed.That being said, the sound is impressively clear and crisp. The volume capacity for the sound bar is quite a lot where it gets loud in a medium sized room when going near halfway. It feels like a platinum-plated Stereo platform--not to be confused with a acoustic orchestral house in upper tier surround sound units. For the price it will supplement your TV very well.The Subwoofer does its 'rumble' very well and can a lot of times be too much. This resulted in me turning the Sub down -2 after first use. While some movies, games, and TV take advantage of having the 'extra' signal to the bass--some do not, which you will miss after having this around when doing a movie/gaming night. Nevertheless, the subwoofer gives the impression of being in the movies as the bass adds to the fullness of the experience.**The subwoofer is wireless and only requires a cable for the power cord** From my ears there was no discernible, or at least meaningful, delay in bass consistency. Think the setup of the wireless sub might be difficult? Here is how you do it, remember to pay close attention:1. Find a good place for the subwoofer and set it near a power inlet.2. Plug in power cord.You are done. I included the steps, even though I did not have to, to show you how there is no 'real' setup with it. When the subwoofer has power and after you turn on the LG, it automatically syncs.[---Look---]As you can tell from the pictures it leaves a very small footprint and mimics a small bar underneath your TV that will not draw much attention to it. Coming with a mount, there is not worry about it falling off the wall or the sorts because the weight is very minimal. It is all black--glossy, and looks like...a speaker with 6 tweeters (3 on each side).***Important Mention***Out of the box, while using when watching movies, the sound bar would intermittently cut off during the movie which was later found out to be a sleep function on the system itself. This took a brief time to figure out because the menu on the device was not as intuitive as to be able to quickly resolve this issue. Nevertheless, it was the unit being set to sleep every 15 minutes--which can be turned off completely. Note that when you first power the system on it might have this same occurrence with you.When plugged into a media player, like me, the sound bar will automatically come on when you turn the device on. No real need to press 2 power buttons.----------------------Not discerning much difference between HDMI audio (HD, uncompressed) versus the slightly lossy digital optical, there was not a big difference to me. Normally, I prefer to listen to lossless audio in my music collection on stereo systems and headphones--which I can tell the difference between compared to lossy mp3s. This should mean to you that the sound coming from the NB3530A is good for the price. While the sound does nothing to 'lessen' the quality so that you might think it is bad, it does seem just slightly overpriced. It also will not give you the most out of what your blu-rays have to offer. It did not affect me as I was not coming 'down' from a HD quality setup. However, this might be a downgrade to you where previously you were used to listening to the uncompressed audio, this might be something that you would notice.For those just starting to get into blu-rays or need an upgrade from their TV's built-in speakers the 3530A is a fantastic place to begin your newly begun higher quality audio journey.

$review_text.: I have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now


The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most
That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig

Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go.Look, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space


 Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens

You can always "resize" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space


Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.You never know
I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things
I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park

If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!Matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea
No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems


They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer
They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable

I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality


If you want quality buy SONY!


$SUMMARY.: 1 gig of Sony memory is NOT too much!! I have 2 for each camera!

$review_text.: I couldn't resist writing a review when I saw these as Amazon's "Today's Deal" -- the price was $50 lower than what I paid for my set, but they are an amazing deal even at the regular Amazon price


 I installed mine about 6 months ago, and they still sound fabulous

 My Energy RC-Micro 5.1 replaced a set of much heavier Bose bookshelf speakers that I wanted to replace only because I didn't want to worry about mounting such heavy speakers every time my family moved.I live in a large apartment with high, 11-foot ceilings, and these speakers fill the apartment with crisp highs and booming bass


 My movies and music sound awesome through these Energy speakers


 I dare say that to my ears at least, they sound better than the larger, heavier, and more expensive Bose speakers they replaced.The only complaint I had with these speakers is that the couple of universal speaker mounts I had did not fit them without purchasing some right-sized bolts from the hardware store
 (They do make custom mounts that fit these speakers perfectly, but I didn't want to pay for yet another set of speaker mounts.)At the "Today's Deal" price on Amazon, I would have quickly jumped on the purchase had I not already bought a set 6 months ago.

$REVIEW.: I was a little skeptical and undecided when I was looking for a new 25ft Cat 5e Patch cable, but when I came across this item and read the positive reviews I was curious to find out just how good it really was,When I received this and tried it was I impressed? damn straight I was because I make these cables occasionally (custom) due to my job field (related) but I love having this pre-made and for the price it's a no brain-er I'd rather pay $6.00+ for a pre-made cable than having to it myself (granted I do realize it saves money when you make them yourself but I for one choose not to simply because I'm lazy and would rather not make them)Obviously at work I don't have any other choice but to make them, but trust me, if you need a good ethernet Cat5e cable, you will not go wrong with this.Pros: No loose connections, fast transfer speeds, cable is sturdy and looks durable, boots on ends are great to protect the plastic lock, and is white which can blend easily by the wall.Cons: Absolutely none.Yes, I would recommend it and WILL buy again.

$REVIEW.: This adapter is very, very slow.First of all, the driver found in the bundled CD is horrible
I could only get speeds of around 70 KB/s with that

Afterwards, I noticed that Windows Update had found a driver update for this device  (released on January 2011 - and FYI the actual chipset is a Realtek RTL8192CU)
After installing that, I saw a dramatic increase in download speeds (up to 500 KB/s, but it would still drop to slower rates at random)
Tried the latest Realtek driver from July 2011, but couldn't notice a difference in speed between that and the Windows Update one

For your reference, I could get these files at over 2MB/s with my other wireless adapter, and my OS is Windows 7 x64.I tried both Hulu and Netflix, but they were both unwatchable due to constant buffering

With my other adapter Hulu buffers for a second or two at the beginning of the video, and then never pauses due to buffering issues
With this Belkin adapter, on the other hand, the video was stopping every 10 seconds.Oh, and during the entire time I had this connected to my PC, the signal strength to the router was excellent


So, download rate issues do not appear to be from poor wireless connectivity.Maybe I have a defective unit, but at this point I can't recommend it.

We had the machines (treadmill and an elliptical), the workout mirror -- even speakers for our iPods. But there was something missing that the sports club offered: A wall-mounted flat screen television.Enter the Philips Tilting LCD Wall Mount. Problem = solved.The wall mount was simple to install and now the old 32-inch flat panel that had been collecting dust in a guest room is back in use. Having the option to watch a workout video, a movie, the news... really takes the pain (most of it) out of working out. Two thumbs up for this product.

$REVIEW.: I bought this item as a tool in promoting sleep but this has not really worked out


It's very easy to use and that design is good,but the speakers are very poor and have a cheap old transistor radio sound

It's as if there is a little "white noise" in every setting.For $40 it seems Sharper Image could have included speakers that reproduced somewhat the real sound of the ocean or birds singing
The other major defect in design is that the "tracks" used in each setting are very short and this VERY irritating

When I'm trying to get to sleep I easily get "locked" into predicting the "next chime"
The track repeats so soon that I begin to focus on it, when that is exactly what I'm trying to let go of

Also the "train" track sounds like a child's toy.So please put a little more in to it


I'm giving my unit away- Really the price for this quality should be around $15.

$REVIEW.: With so many stellar reviews for this product it's tough to know whether or not to believe the hype.  Believe it! This is a quality made ARCTIC product that does what it promises to do, and is backed by a solid 2 year warranty.Compatible with all smartphones including iPhone, Samsung, Blackberry, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, Sony and LG.  This battery is about the same size as an iPhone 4S with an Otterbox case (my point of reference is my own...), and it weighs only about a quarter of a pound and comes in 4 colors.The 4000 mAh capacity is excellent for tablets, which just can't get the juice they need to fully charge from anything smaller.  (At least not from a battery at 10% or so.)  While this power bank can take up to 6 hrs to fully charge, it can remain on standby for up to THREE YEARS!  That's a crazy-long time to be waiting for something to hook-up to it, but it's nice to know that if you travel with it, the back-up won't be discharging until you want it to do so.I also like that this battery has short-circuit and over-current/voltage protection.  Meaning, you can't over charge this one, potentially damaging it.  You can fully charge the internal Lithium Polymer battery up to 1000 times.Shipping with a carrying pouch and two cables whereby you can attach most music players, digital cameras, Bluetooth headsets and speakers, smartphones and tablets.  (NOTE:  30-pin and Lightening cables are not included, but you can use any cables to charge devices with a USB connection.Apple 30-pin to USB Cable andAmazonBasics USB A to Lightning Compatible Cable - Apple Certified - Black (3 Feet/0.9 Meter)will work and aren't too expensive.)The metal case doesn't really show fingerprints unless you've been eating greasy fries and haven't wiped your hands.  It stays cool to the touch while charging and discharging.I wish that the LED lights indicating battery levels were like some with a bank of four lights that diminish as the power is discharged.  As it is you need to consult the included documentation (or one of several Amazon reviews...) to know the code to read percentages of battery depletion for this product.I've been lucky enough to try several brands of power banks similar to this one (Duracell Portable Power Bank Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery (4000mAh) for iPhone, iPad, Samsung (Black)for example, and I find this product superior in construction, and competitive in price and performance.  Backed by a great warranty, there's truly no reason not to buy this product if you want a battery back-up that can easily be tucked into your bag or pocket for charges on the go.

I purchased this from Good as New electronics and it is exactly the same as the battery that came with the camera, and the picture is accurate.

$REVIEW.: I bought these prior to taking a nonstop flight across country, deliberately leaving a pair of previously owned noise canceling  headphones at home


I wanted to see if Klipsch could deliver as advertised; I was more than pleasantly surprised
The S4 has a design that conforms to your left and right ear profiles in addition to an ear tip that makes a very effective seal inside the ear canal, which is where the "noise isolation" comes in


During my 5-6 hour flight, very little outside noise was noticed, airplane "drone" or otherwise
The reason I didn't give 5 stars is that they are ear buds, and I have yet to own a pair that didn't begin to get uncomfortable over time
Outside of the comfort issue, they worked and worked well
NOTE: these are NOT noise cancelling headphones; however, they function almost as well in that capacity

Also comes with a free case, but mine didn't close so well.

Cannot find anything even close in this price range.I found that the picture quality is as good as my Cannon Elf and Video is just as good and the file size is much smaller than the Cannon.I love the portability due to its size. The screen size is just right. Sound is great too. Battery life is great last all day for me  no problem.I liked that it comes with a case for your belt.I do have some things about that I do not like.I do not like the button controls as they are abit unuser friendly and are too many. Could have just used a 4 way rocker like most do.I have a very hard time trying to use it and make any adjustments while just using one hand.I cannot use it with my Mac and there is no support for Macs that is why I gave it to my son.So to sum it up if you have a pc then it is great for the money!!

$review_text.: I'm happy I spent the little extra money to get the two-tone version of this because it is very attractive, has a nice texture and is tough and easy to clean. Fintie does not increase the size of the Kindle Fire by much but it is something to hang on to so the tablet does not slip from your fingers. Should you drop your tablet it offers considerable protection. And most important for me, I can easily eat or sit and read or watch without propping the table up on something. There are two viewing angles with the Fintie, the main one being almost perpendicular to the table surface and the reverse, tilting the tablet up about one inch. I wish the reverse angle had a catch or a lock to prevent the cover from slipping out of the latch groove in this configuration but this is a very minor consideration. It works just fineThe cover closes with a magnet strong enough so it does not fall open but is easily pulled open with a finger. Buttons and speakers of the Fire HDX are fully accessible at all times.I have seen quite a few cover/stands for the Kindle Fire HDX, many much more expensive than Fintie. After owning this now for more than a month I would still choose it over any other one I've seen.

Video and audio are streaming immediately.  Be careful and avoid getting the camera and hand held too close to each other...feedback will result.Quality and Range:We tested this from multiple locations in our home - 2nd floor to basement, basement to back yard, main floor to garage, and garage to 2nd floor.....all worked PERFECTLY with one drop out which I believe was due to batteries not being fully charged.  Once fully charged I did not notice a connection drop.  The quality is as can be expected with a device like this...its NOT high definition :) - it is however VERY VERY good for what i does and you have a clear image on the hand held with audio via wireless which in itself is an AWESOME feature.  The still images too are not of high quality...but you can capture some stunning moments and add them to your photo albums...its not intended to replace your digital camera. :)The product out of the box is set to use for one camera - however, the hand held unit can support up to 4 different cameras that are paired with it...basically press 1 for camera one, and so on.  You would have to purchase additional cameras.  The ability to setup 4 cameras around your home and have a surveillance system in your pocket is AWESOME...The build quality on the hand held could be a little better in terms of hardware...but I think the WORST part is the software on the hand held is very lack luster and does not respond to the users actions properly...it is slow at best.  This is the only reason that this product gets a 4/5 from me...fix the software/firmware on the hand held and its a 5 star product.This is a GREAT effort and an excellent product with many possibilities..but make sure your expectations are set correctly and you wont be disappointed.  4/5 stars for me.

When I ride, I use the right ear bud only to listen to music while still staying aware of road traffic.  Running, I use both ear buds.  Great to be able to receive or make calls as needed here. I also use this in the office to block out background noise.  One thing to note; I have to stop a ride or run to have a phone conversation as the mike does not filter out the noise of air going over the mike, not a big deal though.

$REVIEW.: ***** THIS IS STRICTLY A PC REVIEW *******I must say, I was very skeptical of wireless heaphones when researching for the pair I wanted. Playing WOW can require calling out events in a timely manner and there are so many bad reviews for just about every make and model, so it makes it hard to ultimately deside to go wireless. I wasn't sure if the small amount of negative reviews for the PX3's were because of the very little overall reviews in general or the quality of the headset, until I got them hooked up. This review is after one week of use:INSTALLATION:Installation is extremely painless. Completely plug and play. You will probably need to set the Turtle Beach headphones (Listed as Speakers in your Sound Control Panel) to Default, as well as the microphone. All you really need to do is go to "Sound" in your control panel, enable and set default for both.SOUND:Even though they are just a stereo headset when used on your PC, they still sound great. Apparently, you can add a device that will turn this headset into full surround sound, but it costs around $80. These are already expensive enough. You may as well just buy the PX5's at that point. The volume control is on the headset making it very convenient. There is also a volume bar on that appears in the bottom right corner of your display when adjusting volume, lettign you know your level and minimum / maximum levels. I really feel that surround and 5.1 should have been incorporated for the price they are charging, but my gaming does not require it so oh well. My understanding is that you get these capabilities with XBOX and PS3, so no worries for your first person shooters. You also loose the audio presets when using with PC or MAC.TRANSMISSION:I keep reading complaints about crackling and popping with wireless headsets. I am lucky enough to have my PC and the transmitter close to the center of my house, but the furthest point is still about 25-30', and I have crystal clear audio in all areas of my home. I even tested outside at about 40-45' through walls and couldn't get an issue. Considering I will never go further than that, I did not want to continue to push it because, knowing my luck, I might never get it working perfectly again.MICROPHONE:Surprisingly, everyone I chat with, using Ventrilo, says that I have never been so clear. Some say I sound different, even from my real voice, but much more clear. My biggest complaint is the lack of a programmable talk button. One button to program as any key would have been huge here. It is nice to move around the house without missing the conversation, but it gets frustrating when you can't respond. My way around this is to remove Push-to-Talk and mute my mic when not talking. Since the headset at least has the mic mute on it, this is not a bad way around it, I just hate contantly changing settings, muting, and un-muting.BATTERY:Uses a Lithium Ion Battery so I am getting the specified 10 hours, sometimes a bit more, so can't complain. Best part is, you can use while charging, so you do not have to worry about downtime for charging. The charging cable is USB Mini to USB-A and it is about 15' long, so you have plenty of length no matter where your PC is.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this headset and very happy to no longer be tethered to my PC. I gave four stars for the lack of a programmable talk button, the loss of audio presets when used with PC, and the loss of surround sound with PC. The cost may be up there, but after the pile of poor wireless headset reviews I have read, I decided to spend the extra cash to make sure I got it right the first time, and with this headset, I really feel that I did.** As a side note, this headset can be used as wired to your PC, but does not come with the data transmission cable to do so. this means, you will need to purchase a separate USB Mini to USB-A 5-Pin cable. The included cable are only 3-Pin for power. So be sure to double check the specifications to ensure that the cable is 5-pin to support power, along with transmit and receive data transmission. You can always maintain the wireless connection while keeping the power cord plugge in. Eventually though, the battery will no longer hold a charge so you will need a data cable. Hopefully this will not be an issue for quite a long time being a Lithium Ion battery.*** UPDATE ***So far, the headphones still work great. I have noticed an issue when my PC is idle for long periods of time. I never put my PC to sleep or log off, but I do lock when away. When I come back, I typically need to disconnect and reconnect the USB in order to get the mic working again. Kind of a pain, but nothing too horrible. One thing that is supposed to resolve this, although for some reason it does not for me, is turning the USB Sleep mode off in your Advanced Power Settings. I have also pulled all nighters which run the battery down. After the 10-11 hours, if I let the battery get too low, it will not function while charging. I am trying to find a 5-pin USB cable to then make this a wired headset, but so far, I am not finding anything that allows my computer to recognize the headset at all. Will update if I do.

$review_text.: This enclosure almost took more time to unpack than to install two disks and create a Raid 0 scratch disk.  The things I noticed as soon as I opened the box were the quality of the unit's fit/finish, the power supply and cables.  After installing two 1TB drives, I connected it to my Mac Pro with the Firewire 800 connection and powered the enclosure on.  Both disks (from a previous mirrored array) were recognized immediately, the front panel prompted me for type of Raid desired (0 or 1) and after I selected 0, the striped volume was created and ready for initialization on the Mac in less than a minute.  Display offers all the info on the system and drives I need.  Fan is on all the time, but at relatively low RPM (3300), and the fan noise is masked by the drives anyway.  After rebooting everything and connecting via eSATA, I set up the disk as the scratch disk for an editing session in Final Cut Express.  Excellent performance, and after thrashing on the drives for a couple hours, neither the temp of the box nor the drives exceeded 40 degrees Celsius.  Totally satisfied with this box so far.

$REVIEW.: When the step down ring arrived (49mm to 46mm) it didn't fit the 46mm thread on my lens. I tried fitting the 49mm filter on the 49mm end and it didn't fit either. I tried fitting the 49mm filter to the 46mm end, in case if I am doing it the wrong way. Nothing worked.So basically this thing is totally useless. Not that I am very mad, but I really didn't want to spend another 30 dollars on a quality UV filter for my other lens just because it has a smaller thread (46mm) than the other (49mm) but these guys don't give me a choice. And returning this back to the seller? Not worth returning this since it's just $7.Buyer beware.

$REVIEW.: [original review of the 2Gb micro card which is not available anymore with an addendum.]I purchased this item, and wanted it shipped the cheapest way possible. unbeknown to me, this meant amazon shipping it by the united states postal service. I tracked the package, and after a few days, received the box.it was just an empty box. there was a postcard sized invoice inside, some packaging material, but nothing else. i also noticed the bottom of the amazon box was slightly torn (glue holding the box together was ripped off)so i "called" amazon and got some customer service agent in india. remarkably, amazon customer service was better than i expected, and was able to resolve my missing item by sending a replacement.I also emailed a suggestion to amazon.com's shipping department that in the future, they should SEAL and SECURE the bottom of ALL their shipping boxes with tape, and not just put a small piece of shipping tape on the top of the box.  this suggestion will also save amazon.com a lot of money from theft.5 stars for amazon.com4 stars for this product.0 stars for the post office.and -5 stars and a bullet in the head for the guy who stole the item from my original purchase.

$REVIEW.: Though this product claims to support the iPad's smart cover feature where it turns on/off as you open/close the cover, the magnets are misaligned causing the iPad to stay on when it is closed. I called Belkin about this the day after I had purchased the case, and though they acknowledged that it was a problem, they refused to replace it after nearly a month of correspondence.Other than that, the case is pretty good. I've noticed that the flap that holds the cover closed is starting to fall apart after only a few weeks of moderate use, though. Color and feel are nice. iPad feels secure in the case.

Before the unlock this cpu was already blazingly fast at 3.0ghz 4 core it can handle simultaneous gaming and watching a movie on up to 3 screens dependent on video card
This thing is outstanding prior to any tinkering

So that is the first part of my review for stock cpu buyers it defeats the i3 but not quite the i5.Overclockers:First try overclocked this thing to 3.6ghz I DIDNT EVEN UP THE VOLTAGE and using the mobos (M59A7 i suggest the EVO) turbo boost technology in sync with amd overdrive I got this thing up to 4 ghz well 3.998 but close enough lol.Hidden Cores: Once again my used my mobo and it automatically unlocked 2 additoinal cores so this thing turned into a 6 core processor so easy

I currently have the 6 core unlocked version of this cpu running at 3.7ghz so not bad for a 4 core 3.0ghz cpu.Note: Unlocking cores is mobo dependent some mobos wont allow it so choose wisely

$REVIEW.: I previously purchased and installed another touch-screen shield.  It worked and stopped the glare, but I couldn't get the bubbles out.  The Clear Touch Ultra touch-screen shield installs easily without the bubbles.  It is good for removing glare, and finger prints are not as noticeable.  The images on screen remain just as clear and sharp.  And it  comes with items to clean the screen before installation, and a microfiber cloth to wipe off dust and finger prints after it is installed.If you have an Amazon 7&#34; Kendal Fire HD, and you're fussy like me, then this is the touch-screen shield for you.  If little bubbles on the screen don't bother you, buy one of the cheaper ones.  If glare doesn't bother you, don't waste your money.  The Gorilla Glass on this Kindle screen can take a lot of abuse and still shine like new.

$REVIEW.: I bought 1 pair of these glasses to try out the 3D on my system ( 2009 Mitsubishi 73837 3D capable, Panasonic DMP BDT-300 3D HD DVD player and these glasses)
I set the TV to 3D and hit play on the dvd player with Open Season 3D loaded


No effects so I reversed the glasses setting in the TV set-up


WOW!!! The 3D effects were amazing in this movie which played in a semi bright room at noon today

I can not wait to see Evil Resident IV 3D tonight to see if it works better during darkness

I do not have the Mitsu emitter because the DLP works very well with this set and glasses

I tried viewing the TV all around the room at various angles and from as far away as 18 feet


They work anywhere in my living room, (20ft X 14ft)
The brightness of the TV with these glasses is fine


For those that do not know the Panasonic 300 outputs checkerboard format perfectly to match with the Mitsu TV, so I do not need the Mitsu converter till the Dish Network satellite starts showing 3D


I am thinking about switching to Direct TV which already has three to four channels including ESPN 3D!! The Panasonic also has two HDMI outputs
I use the main HDMI out for a direct connection to my TV through a 1.4a cable for best direct video results
The second HDMI out is for audio only (video turned off for this output in the DVD set-up) which goes to my Sony receiver for processing the sound

Great system working well together.Have fun with it!Update 1/17/2011These glasses have a shiny serial number plaque on the inside right frame that reflects light back into the lens from the room or TV light
It is distracting but a piece of black electrical tape cures the problem
The manufacturer should use their own glasses before placing them on the market


The problem is minor and easily fixed and I still plan to order four more for the rest of my family!!

The keypad feels a bit awkward at first since it is small ( i have small hands too). The only thing i don't like is that i have to reconnect via bluetooth every time i open my ipad but oh well, that is about the only thing i can find wrong with it. I'm trying to see how business friendly it is so i can completely replace my work laptop but until then, I have to haul both of them around. :) ....a definite buy and I gave it four stars since i could not give it 4.5..the minus .5 was due to the keyboard size and the reconnecting part but other than that it is a definite buy since there is no use having a larger keyboard or your case would be the size of your laptop.

$review_text.: It's a nice design, overall

But I found that my iPad in its Marware folio cover wouldn't fit, so every time I want  to use the Belkin mount, I have to extract the iPad from the cover, which is a struggle since the cover is a tight fit


And with a 10" (full-sized) iPad, portrait mode won't work, as in that orientation the tablet is too tall for the Belkin holder


That's unfortunate, since I'd have preferred to read my recipes that way and avoid scrolling


And it's especially annoying since the product's packaging conspicuously boasts that it is "cover compatible"!Finally--and this is probably of interest only to RVers--all my cabinets have a 1" lip to prevent the contents from spilling out while underway, and that lip makes it impossible to tighten up the Belkin mount's clamping mechanism


It's still usable, but can be a bit wobbly
I don't really blame Belkin for this, but it's an annoyance in my situation.Bottom line: it's a good idea, but I'd like to see a larger vertical adjustment range to accommodate tablets in portrait mode, and a wider tablet clamp to allow for tablets in covers.

$REVIEW.: We have these installed in various locations around our facilities at work, and if you install them correctly and have realistic expectations they will do the job.  What this device actually does essentially relocate cell signal.  It takes the cell service you have at the best location on your property and pipes it directly into buildings etc.  This will not give you any better signal than you have at the best reception area of your property.  For example, if you have three bars on the roof of your house where you mount the antenna you will not have any more than three bars in your house at the internal antenna.  The installation is easy enough if you are a handyman of any sorts and the product works well for what it is.  Overall I recommend the product.

$REVIEW.: I'd first like to thank the other reviewers here for their precise and comprehensive analyses of this lens, with special thanks to "Capt RB"


Your comments were very instrumental in my deciding to purchase this lens, and I'm VERY glad I did! My experience with this superb optic has been identical to most of yours; likewise my opinion of this product, as well
So much so that in place of a lengthy and verbose review of my own (and I fully intended to write one, too!), I'll simply say "Ditto!" , but with just a few added comments:1


This lens is not only sharper than the Nikon 105 2.8 micro, but it's MUCH sharper!2

Overall IQ, in my opinion, is superior to the 105 2.8 Nikkor in every way that matters to me...color, contrast, raw resolution and fine detail, brightness and color saturation, a complete absence of any and all linear distortions, freedom from purple fringing and insignificant levels of secondary chromatic aberations


And need I even mention its substantially better rendering of out of focus elements, or bokeh as it's often called.Bottom line: I haven't seen image quality like this since I last held a Leica in my hands!3


Build quality (which cost Tamron that highly coveted "5th star") is just barely adequate; reminiscent more of Nikons 55-200mm budget tele-zoom lens rather than their micro-nikkors
But I'm more than willing to live with it's flimsy construction in exchange for its absolutly stellar image quality


I'm just going to have to be very, very careful how I handle, transport, and store it
Consider her, if you will, as one might a fine Patek Phillipe timepiece...too fragile to take on safari, but of utterly stunning, world class performance.This one shortcoming notwithstanding, I would opt for this lens every time!&lt;UPDATE!> After using this lens quite extensively for the past few weeks, I'd like to point out a few important things that weren't immediately apparent when first using it.My copy of this outstanding lens features Tamrons most recent improvement to its already  classic design, namely the addition of the built-in autofocus drive motor

It is noteworthy that the few negative criticisms to be found in other reviews of this lens, specifically regarding slow or noisy AF, all appear to apply only to those models that use the camera bodys AF drive motor and not to this newest version

I do have one such lens, the Nikon 70-300mm G, and if it's any example of screw-drive autofocus performance, then such criticisms are most likely well deserved.As for auto-focus speed with the built in AF motor, let me tell you that when restricted to its 'non macro' range (1.5' - Inf.) this puppy is not just fast, but REALLY fast! Outdoors with my Nikon D90, in any reasonable level of 'daytime' lighting, autofocus is achieved in a blink of an eye, and with utterly no 'hunting'


It focuses faster than my AFS 16-85mm VR Nikkor, and even a little quicker than the 50mm 1.8 AF-D, and much quieter

Incidently, focus accuracy at ANY distance is 'dead on' accurate! And unlike quite a number of macro optics, it's also critically sharp at any distance, too

Between the fast, quiet, and accurate focusing,  this lens is actually quite useful when action stopping shutter speeds are necessary


While certainly more than adequate for capturing a visit to the 'dog park' or kids at play, I don't know that I'd reccommend it for shooting nighttime jai-lai matches by available light but then, this lens wasn't designed for that purpose.In more typical 'Macro' applications, autofocus while neither as fast or quiet as previously mentioned, is quite respectable and most of all, resolute and precise.Over these last few weeks with this lens, I've also come to re-evaluate its build quality


I put it somewhat above the Nikkor kit lenses, but still a little below my 16-85mm VR Nikkor zoom, the 18-200 VR Nikkor, or the AFS 70-300 VR Nikkor

Considering that this Tamron 90mm 2.8 Macro lens costs about half what those others do, I'd now be more inclined to say that while not "Press Corp" rugged, it's build quality and construction are certainly adequate for such purposes as it was made
And, yes...I'd reccommend it again and again!So, okay...let's give her another 1/4 star!

$REVIEW.: I picked up a set of these just to give them a try on my Etymotic Hf3s. I have never been able to find a pair of foam tips that I really like. The large foam tips that come with the Etymotic are nice but are hard to get a good tight fit and because I wear mine several hours a day they wear out quickly. I read some very good reviews of the Comply and decided to give them a shot. The fit on the headset is excellent and they were easy to insert and get a good seal. I have only worn them about an hour at a stretch so far but they are very comfortable and did not fatigue my ear canal in that time. I am looking forward seeing how they do over time for both comfort and durability. My only real complaint is that they are a bit pricey at $15 for 3 pair where the Etymotic is $12 for 5 pair.

Don't you hate reading networking reviews that only quote connect speeds and not real world speeds?Router: ASUS RT-AC68UClient: Dell XPS 15z notebook upgraded with 802.11ac mini-pci adapter (Intel Network 7260.HMWG), Windows 8.1, Intel 7260 driver from Intel website (19 Sept 2013).The ASUS RT-AC68U has eliminated all the WiFi dead zones in my house (3 floors, 3600sf). I'm getting downloads around 100mbps in most rooms although sometimes as low as 6mbps at the edges. Within 10 feet of the router, I'm getting downloads around 280mbps. Wired Ethernet speeds are around 400mbps wired.With a SSD attached to the USB 2.0 port of the router, I get file transfer speeds of 200mbps using USB 2.0.With USB 3.0, I get around 280mbps speeds, and 400mbps wired. I had to disabled "Reducing USB 3.0 interference" to get USB 3.0 working.I'm not sure if I really see the extra speed of USB 3.0 as throughput easily dips below USB 2.0 max speed when 10+ feet from router.FWIW, I notice that the Intel Network 7260.HMWG seems to give me 25% better battery life than the OEM mini-pic WiFi adapter.

$REVIEW.: I love this gadget so much I actually bought 2, one in black and the other white

Nearly everyone that has asked me about it has bought one

LG doesn't need to waste money on TV advertisement of these, they work so well

You can use both earbuds or just one

The microphone is by far the best of any bluetooth device in terms of noise reduction and clarity that I've tried, and I'd had literally dozens


Battery life is easily a whole day of constant use


My favorite feature of these is the ability to simultaneously pair with two items, for example, paired with your phone AND say a laptop or a PS3 (or ps4) so you can listen/talk with people on you laptop/game console and if your phone rings hold the answer button and it switches to the phone until you hang up
The &#34;necklace&#34; design is so much more comfortable than hanging something on your ear, it will also vibrate when there is a call or if you walk to far from a paired device


Charges in about an hour from almost dead, although to this day I have yet to drain one all the way to shut off
I am aware that there is now a new model but these work so well I'm not feeling the need to even try it


One of the more useful bluetooth designs I've ever used


Bravo LG!

$REVIEW.: I have owned Olympus cameras for over 10 years now and have always had a great experience, so when I was ready to move up to a bigger model I of course looked to them.I am so dissapointed though, not only am I out over $400, I have a camera that is inferior to my old olympus.  I am not impressed by the quality of the prints this camera takes, I find it very cumbersome to use. I was so quick to focus on things with the little toggle button on my old camera and now I have to use two hands to focus this and for nothing more than show, it really isn't a camera that you have to move the lens cap to focus, it could easily be done with a toggle switch, but the manufacturer wanted it to appear more professional. I don't think the shoot button is laid out well either it is hard to man this camera with just one hand. The quality of the photos when you do a sports action, or multi frame action mode is horrible. I need to sit down with someone who knows cameras better than I to see if we can over ride the factory settings on that feature.  I also didn't like how the unit opens to hook up the USB port to download the pictures onto your computer, it is a very tight fit and I am always worried about breaking something.So to wrap it up, I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is not camera savvy, (doesn't know what Aperature means etc) or who wants some thing to just point and shoot.A few features I do like though, are the scene and guide features where it has "dummy" settings for lighting, specific scenes etc.  and as for the 20X zoom, it really does get you up close fast, and takes a fairly decent picture. I would have to say the 20X zoom takes much better photos than the standard photo taking mode.Olympus has made some awesome cameras but this is not one of them.

$REVIEW.: I don't know about the DVR model, but you really have no other choice than to go with this receiver if you just want HD via DirecTV.  I personally hate it that there are no choices when it comes to getting satellite receivers.  The features on this receiver are rather ordinary.  I can live with that, but what drives me crazy is the lag when changing channels.  It's especially slow when going from a channel at 480p to one at 1080i.  Most people probably aren't going to be bothered by this.  As for the interface, it's rather standard fare.  You have autotuning so that the system automatically goes to a program that you select.  There's the usual interactive guide, and the ability to program favorite channels.  But there's no killer app.  Perhaps there isn't on any other service either.  It just would be nice if there were some competition.  Instead of each service competing, competition with the receivers would get us something different and perhaps faster.If you're reading this, you're probably more shopping for the service than for the receiver since you can't have one without the other.  Perhaps that's why some have decided to air their opinions of the service.  I've been a DirecTV customer for seven years and for the most part have no complaints.

I have used to to move images and slide shows and also store projects in the almost complete stage.

You can't fit another USB plug next to it on a MacBook Pro.  It's too wide. That's my only issue.  It's also a little tricky to set it up. The directions could be written better.

$REVIEW.: This is a great television. It's got all the advanced options for people, like myself, that enjoy tweaking settings on their gadgets. The matte finish is perfect for rooms with a lot of ambient light, both natural or artificial. The color of the television is extremely impressive, especially after it's been calibrated.As with most LCDs the blacks are a little lacking, but the contrast is pretty good overall. The matte finish is really nice at preventing glare and reflections. Images and color are pretty uniform across the screen and off center viewing is very impressive, compared to some older LCDs. My screen has some issues with blotchy, slightly darker areas, on the left side, but it's very subtle and only shows up in very specific instances. My wife doesn't see it at all and I can't seem to "unsee" it, but it's a very minor issue.There are a ton of connection options (multiple HDMI, component, RGB, DVI, etc), which make this TV pretty future proof and allow users with older video equipment to upgrade their TV without having to replace their other gear.My favorite thing about the LG50 is that it can be calibrated to professional standards using the built in user menus. All one needs is a colorimeter, a calibration DVD, and some calibration software and you can make professional level adjustments to the color settings. It's not for everyone, but if you're into geeky stuff like that, you'll appreciate the option to do so. If you're not into that kind of advanced adjustment, there's still a lot of other more simple adjustments that can be made to help improve the picture quality, as well as presets.On top of all that, you're getting full 1080p, high definition resolution.

$REVIEW.: This is not an audiophile amp, it's not even a 75w x2 amp. It is a basic amp for powering a small pair of speakers you would put on the patio or in a bedroom or bathroom. At 8ohm it's probably realistically putting out 15-20w RMS per channel. Which makes my pair of yamaha indoor/outdoor speakers on the patio sound pretty good up until 2/3 volume, then it distorts like crazy. But I have no need to go that loud. I usually run it at 1/3 for music which is about as loud as it can be where you can still hold a conversation at normal levels. For sports I turn it up to half to hear commentators clearly.In short as long as you have reasonable expectations of what you are getting you should not be disappointed by this amp.

 I do have it all plugged in correctly (trust me - I'm more than qualified when it comes to electricity).Knowing what i know now, I wouldn't get one of these kind of power strips (had an APC brand do the same thing to me about a year ago) but would have got a plug strip with remote off switch so I could positively turn the whole mess off at night.On the good side, the plug layout is well thought out and works well for those clunky transformer plugs.2 stars because while it's a nice plug strip the power sensing auto-off does not work.

$REVIEW.: I purchased 3 pairs of these headphones (for my children & myself). I've had the headphones for almost a year, I use the headphones regularly and I'm just now encountering problems with only one pair (the pair I use the most). I am not positive, but I believe an inner component is beginning to loosen. I do not use these headphones casually, but for my daily exercise which usually consists of walking, jogging, aerobics, plyometrics and calisthenics. Considering the amount of jolting, tossing and abuse these headphones endure, I'd say they've held up OK. These headphones aren't the best of quality in audio or design, but they are certainly worth $20-30. They were a little confusing to sync initially, but you're an expert after you've done one. In retrospect it's so easy you'll laugh at yourself.

$review_text.: I am using my Magic Mouse as I write this and am reminded of something my best friend said to me years ago after he'd bought a BMW. "Eric, its not hype if its true!"  Well, that phrase can easily apply to the Apple Magic Mouse.  Its been billed as a revolution in mouse technology and that is as exact a description as one could hope to get.  Out of the box, the device is simple and elegant - a tiny curved wedge, with a grey Apple logo at one end. Plain white, with a glossy surface, it looks terrific on the desktop next to my Apple Keyboard. And on the surface, it does everything that a point and click mouse does - that is, it points, and it clicks.  But - no buttons on the surface, as the mouse itself is one great big button, with a touch sensitive surface for added functionality.  As I am writing this, I'm switching between several webpages in my browser, simply by swiping two fingers on the surface of the mouse.  Turning pages with a gesture identical to turning a page in a book.  Earlier today, I was working on an image in Photoshop - I was able to zoom into and out of the image simply by holding the option key on my keyboard and sliding my finger up and down the mouse.  The scaling is precise and smooth, unlike the other methods available for scaling.  With the standard mouse software, the MM was a bit sluggish, but if you download MagicPrefs from this site: [...] you'll be able to customize the mouse in ways that are nothing short of remarkable.  I loved the Mac Mighty Mouse too (many of my coworkers revile the thing, but I was quite happy with it!)  The Magic Mouse makes the older model look like a stone hammer by comparison.  For working with image editing and word processing programs as often as I do, the Magic Mouse is the perfect control tool!  Apple hits another home run.
$SUMMARY.: Its not hype if its true

$REVIEW.: This review is being written 12/2/2012 for Uniden BT1021 Cordless Phone Battery 2.4 Volt, Ni-MH 750mAh - Replacement fo UNIDEN BT-1008, BT-1016, sold by third party vendors who advertise on the Amazon website.This battery replaced the OEM unit in the Uniden phone OK.  It contains two AAA batteries connected together and surrounded by an outer jacket.  Its performance is rather weak, but that is more the fault of the phone design and decision to use AAA's to save weight and cost vs. AA's which last longer and are used in some other Uniden phones.  Even with the so-called power-saving design on the newer Uniden phones, the AA-designed units last longer between charges for me.Overall, I'd recommend this product as long as the price is cheap.

$review_text.: Another Gold Box purchaser here. I was about to get the X version from Costco, but this deal came along and bought one. Panasonic is my brand of choice because I need the best LCD viewing angle I could find.  I wanted an LCD TV that had the viewing angle of a CRT, and all other brands disappointed me, until I found the Panasonics. No one comes close to Panasonic's IPS panels. Specs mean nothing when comparing viewing angles. Consumer Reports only rates it as a Very Good viewing angle, I wonder what they under the influence of? It's fantastic.The Picture is excellent out of the box.The sound is OK, about as good as an LCD can get. Notably better than Vizio. For the uneducated, LCD's will never have the sound of a CRT due to space limitations. Welcome to the digital age.I turn off AI sound, as I have yet to meet a so-called volume Leveler that works. Surround Sound ON, Bass +15, Treble +10. Volume leveler +7.The headphone jack is actually quite good with headphones. Using it as an analog output to an amp or powered speakers however, it takes uncomfortably cranking up the TV volume , which will blow out the speakers if you don't remember to turn the volume back down when disconnecting. Why Panasonic didn't include an Analog RCA output is beyond me, and  this is my only issue with their TV's on the whole.

that is itCons:-Fits very loosely-You can't press the buttons easily, you need to use your fingernails now-If you plan to use the clip it won't be easy as the skin takes like 80% of the space available when you push the clip open, I could barely clip it on anything-Use the clip and the skin will slip off-Only protects the sides..

not much protection, the clip is still exposed to scratches and dents.-If you have pets or plan to clean dusty places prepare yourself to clean this skin too
Fur from pets stick to it like a magnet.Buy a complete case or something else, this one is really just something to make you iPod look like a black iPod and nothing more

$REVIEW.: Yes it is the most expensive model but it is worth it. First and for me the best feature is the speed. I had a Roku HD in the bedroom for years and we recently moved away from cable and put Roku's in all the room. I tried some refurbished Roku HD's did not have much luck and sent them back to many freezes and to many channel glitches. So I bit the bullet and got two of the Roku 3's. I love them. They are probably close to the advertised 5x faster as far as loading channels and navigating the menus. When you are used to cable your hole life this kind of speed matters. Second is the upgraded remote. Has a wifi connection and motion sensors for playing games. I have only tried the free Angry Birds game but was very surprised how responsive the controller was. I think it works better then my wii remote. (I know they are Apples and Oranges as far as tech goes but it works) lastly is the head phone jack in the remote. It works (for the most part) they have been a couple of cut out here and there and you have to unplug and re-plug headphones back in to reactive the sound. Not that big of a deal. A word of caution!!! If the remote headphones do cut out or get removed the audio automatically starts back on the TV. So If you are using the headphone feature to watch some &#34;Adult content&#34; that you don't want anybody else to hear. Completely turn down the TV, then you can turn up the volume just in the Roku remote. So if it does cut out unexpectedly and transfer the audio back to the TV it wont be loud enough for the KIDS to hear. But in closing well worth the extra money for the added features.
$SUMMARY.: Worth the extra money +++

These units operate the flash in manual mode only, so don't expect ETTL functions with your flash, but for wedding photography they worked great, set the powers of my flashes (used 4 flash units, 4 receivers and the 1 transmitter.  They have great distance and would recommend them.  They have 10 channels so you can set your transmitter to what ever channel you have your flash set up to.  I used two channels and two flashes on each channel.  Worked great as I moved around and set the appropriate flash units for my shot.

$review_text.: I started to review this product and give it an awesome score based on what it does for a PC but Targus has also clearly stated that it works for a Mac as well. So my score is really an amalgamation of the two. This did not cool my Macbook Pro at all. It still ran hot. But I sort of knew that going in. Macs are notorious for it. But there is a solution. Latosta makes a great metal riser/notebook stand that works and I have been faithful to that product since the day I picked it up. It even angles the laptop, adjustable, to offer nice positioning for your hands while you type. And the best part is that it's less than 20 bucks. What bugged me most about Targus is that the fans just sit underneath the Mac doesn't have any openings so the air flow just becomes useless.On a PC this thing works great. My Toshiba constantly overheats and turns off, placing this underneath it saved me from murdering it. You can hear a clear hissing sound from the fans but it's not distracting. Luckily, I only needed one USB slot to power it, when I used to try it out the noise became a distraction then. The low hum turned into a whir that was annoying. And that was on top of the laptop's fans going.So there ya having, works great for PCs and sucks for Mac users.

$review_text.: I bought this to get me by until I can afford something better. Given some of the reviews here, I did not expect much. Nevertheless, I have 3 case fans in my PC.One of them is fairly quiet on it's own. It's one of those with a 3-position speed switch and it's very quiet on it's lowest setting.The other two fans are much noisier. I don't mind a little noise. It's really a tradeoff for good cooling, which is a must. But those fans were starting to wear me down. I bought this to tame them a bit.Worked better than I expected. I think there is a significant gap in the settings where you can turn the knobs and not much happens but the level of adjustment is adequate for my needs. My PC is much quieter now and the temps don't seem to have gone up much.Unfortunately, I kind of had to improvise on placing this in my case. It is made to fit a 3.5" drive bay. A fact I did not notice until after I'd placed the order and the item was already on it's way.All of my 3.5" bays are internal. This is not unusual. Most people only have 5.25" external slots so in order to mount this the way it is (apparently) meant to be designed, you'd need a 3.5 to 5.25 converter. I don't have one and buying one would cost more than this controller cost.Pros -1. Works pretty good. Actually reduces fan noise2. Cheap.3. If I go crazy, it won't be because my PC sounds like a vacuum cleanerCons -1. There's not a word of English on the box and there's no instructions. Though I guess it's not a big deal if you know what you're doing enough to order this to begin with.2. The only "extra" feature this thing has is also a con for many people. The LED lights on the front of it are bright and you can't turn them off. Since I'm actually putting this inside my case (where I will hopefully rarely have to have access to it) and I don't have any kind of windows or anything on my case, I guess I can live with it. If I ever do buy an adapter to put this in my 5.25" bay, I'll have to try and take it apart and kill the LEDs without killing the fan controller portion. Excessive light coming from my PC is almost as bad as excessive noise coming from my PC. Maybe worse.3. It's probably not really possible to get a fan controller with this kind of functionality without a lot of wires but if you like the inside of your case to be pretty, you will be doing some serious cable management to hide the mess of wires this thing creates. Personally, my case is just a black box with a power button and I don't care what it looks like inside so I'm just lucky.4. As cheap as it is, obviously, I kind of worry about reliability. I'd hate to think something might go wrong and I'd be sitting here thinking my fans were doing their job and they aren't even spinning. I'll obviously have to monitor the basic functionality for a few weeks before I trust it.Conclusion -If you like a quiet computer, buy a fan controller. If you can afford it (which you probably can't if you're considering this one), buy a better one than this one. NZXT appears to make some of the better ones.EDIT January 07 2014 - Since I wrote this review, I have not experienced any unforeseen issues with this product. It does what I expected it to do and since I put it inside my case where I can't see the lights, I forget it's even there. I have not adjusted the controls very often since I got them set where I wanted them. That might be a factor to consider if you buy this. If you adjust your fan speeds frequently, you might want to consider a higher quality product.

$review_text.: My car dash camera does not have a display (Lukas LK-7900) to reduce the unit size.  Setting a polarizing filter is much easier with a real time display of the camera view.  This inexpensive panel does the trick.Only comment is the display needs 12 VDC.  It comes with a power cord with stripped wire ends.  I soldered it to a cigarette lighter power plug.  You can also use an AC power adapter which is commonly available at electronic stores, online, or probably in your electronic junk drawer.Video input is required before anything is displayed.  No power indication and the menu button does not work without video input.  It wasn't dead, but I was thinking I had received a DOA unit at first.The right solution for my need.  May put another dash cam in the back window.  If I do, this will make a nice rear view display.

$REVIEW.: I bought this Opteka LP-E8 battery two months ago (Aug 2010)
 When I just placed it in the Canon battery charger, the charger began to flash yellow, indicating a problem

It would charge normally before today.When I placed the battery in the off-brand battery charger, the light immediately turned green, even though it was sitting idle, outside the camera, for the past 4-5 weeks

 Any rechargeable loses some of its charge each day -- I've read (I don't recall the source) on average 1% per day
 That would mean it would need a charge, having only 60-70%
 Even at 90%, the battery charger would kick-in to take it up to 100%.1) the Canon charger indicates a problem with the battery, since the light now flashes yellow.2) the off-brand charger indicates a problem with both the off-brand charger and the battery, since the charger is telling me its fully charged (it's not).A DSLR is fully loaded with very sensitive electronics, as are the lenses

 The camera and lenses are expensive
 Do I want to place questionable batteries in the camera, batteries that can short, just to save $20 off buying a genuine Canon battery?  I don't think so.I've made this mistake before and I should not have made it again


 No camera manufacturer will warranty a camera when used with an off-brand battery

 I have Sony video cameras, with both Sony's and off-brand batteries -- the off-brand batteries have always died long before the brand version ..
always


 Frankly, I don't recall ever having a genuine brand-version battery die.I've bought some off-brand batteries that were DOA (dead on arrival)
 Branded batteries have always performed flawlessly for me

 Keep in mind that anyone can make something with cheaper components, make it look the same, and sell it for less

 A battery that shorts can get so hot that it will begin to melt and even burn.I'm sticking with genuine Canon batteries


 One less thing to worry about.

$REVIEW.: I thought there was nothing wrong with my lamp but decided to buy this one to test and see.  The price was a fraction of what the repair guys wanted (I think they quoted me $180! plus they would need to order it too...)My Mitsubishi 1080 TV (WD-57731)was more and more frequently giving me the yellow blinking lamp light and then it would inexplicably shut down.  After a few minutes I could reboot the TV and it played just fine... -- that is most of the time... I couldn't believe there was a problem with lamp, the picture looked as great and bright as ever... and in my mind a lamp should either work... or not work.  I discovered from the repair guys that Frys sent out (I purchased the 5 year warranty) that it could be some kind of a "motherboard" problem... and that by unplugging the unit and letting it set before restarting would usually work if the plain reboot didn't work...  that seemed to work... but the problem would come and go...and it got really annoying. I had the repair guys out (on warranty) multiple times.I had already had the bulb replaced after 2 1/2 years under warranty (one lamp replacement included in warranty) and this lamp was less than 2 years old.  The blinking light and shut down only happened with in the first 5 minutes of turning the TV on... after which I could watch it all day long... so I knew it was not a overheating issue.So I gambled and bought this lamp so I would know if there was another issue.  The lamp arrived in a couple of days... it did not look as well made as the original and did not have a fine screen to protect it from dust like the one I took out, but had a very coarse plastic grid that could only keep out giant fuzz balls at best.  I had my doubts... but after installing it the TV fired right up... and is going strong every day since -- with no blinking lights and no shut downs...So I am confused as to why the old lamp would still work and look fine but give the error and then shut down... but once restarted would work great the rest of the day...  I love the picture quality of this TV and cannot afford to buy a new one so I am very happy that for $68 I was able to get my old TV working again and looking great... If I end up having problems I will edit this review with a update.UPDATE:  still doing fine after 5 months...still happy.

$review_text.: Getting the air bubbles out of it took a few minutes, but it fits my Kindle HD (I don't know what generation it is..got it brand new for my birthday last week. Hope that'll help..) really well and it's thicker than I anticipated it would be. No problem. The Kindle HD is still completely responsive, and you would really have to NAIL THAT SCREEN to scratch it with the Tech Armor screen protector on.
$SUMMARY.: Fits a 7" Kindle Fire HD perfectly.

$review_text.: These headphones are VERY difficult to review.  All headphone preferences are specific to the listener, but these take that concept to the Nth degree.  So be very mindful that this is just one man's perspective.Appearance: Gorgeous.  'nuff said.  I consider these the best looking cans in the business.  But meh, I'd take a great sounding ugly pair than a horrible sounding attractive pair.  I'm still talking about headphones of course, but I jest.Sealed vs Closed:  these terms are too often used interchangeably, but we all know that not all closed headphones seal.  To me, sealing means that you don't hear the outside environs and others around you don't hear what you are listening to.  When you are in public, you don't want your cans to leak out.  Let's admit it, we all have our guilty pleasure songs that we don't want to admit we keep on our portable music players, beyond the fact that it is just plain rude to your neighbors.  And when you are on a plane, you don't want to hear the crying baby over your cans(isolation).  So if you are looking for a high-quality set of cans that can travel with you, you want "sealed".  For example, the denons are closed cans, but leak sound like crazy with very little isolation from your external environs.  So they are FAR from sealed.  These AKGs I safely report are closed and sealed.  They are great for isolation and limited leakage when you are not alone.32Ohms: Low impedance cans are often times associated with low-end.  But that is far from the truth. Low-Impedance determines how easy it is to power the music.  If you plug in a high impedance set of cans directly into an iphone for example, the volume with be really low and the sound quality will be horrible.  But use that same iphone and use an amp with it, you will greatly enhance the listening pleasure of high impedance headphones.  Generally speaking, ALL cans should benefit from a good DAC/AMP set up, but those with Ohm ratings higher than approximately 100 will REQUIRE a headphone AMP.  A lot of home theater receivers have a great built-in headphone amp, but no computer sound card can truly power a high impedance set of cans(NOT even the Xonar).  Some examples of good low impedance cans are denons, ATH M50, MDR-V6, and Sennheiser HD-25ii.  The AKG K550 is 32Ohms, so any portable device will power it fine without an amp.  They sound great with my Cowon Plenue Z2.  They sound decent connected directly to my laptop.  They sound great for music, movie, and games.  BUT!!! they sound MUCH better with an amp.  In other words, these headphones scale beautifully with a GOOD DAC/AMP.  The more juice you give it, the more it shines.  So although, they are low imp cans, and therefore, work great without an amp, they benefit GREATLY when juiced.SOUND QUALITY:  So why would you want these headphones?  Let's not get it twisted, these cans will never replace my home set up.  In the isolation of my place, I love the experience of putting on a nice set of open-back cans while sipping some wine or scotch.  BUT...I travel a lot and need a nice SEALED headphone that isolates and does not leak.  I used to use the MDR-V6 by Sony.  Great cans with 63Ohms rating.  But the sound stage is small and the sound is a bit too analytical.  Don't get me wrong, they're fantastic, but I've always had my eyes open for a better set of sealed cans.  ATH M50 by audio technica is one of the most highly regarded sealed, low-impedance cans, along with the Senns HD25s, but i wanted a set of cans that rivaled the sound stage of an open-back set of headphones.  So these cans deliver the sound stage?  sort of.  The sound stage is good, really good.  In fact, they're the best I've ever heard from a closed-back headphone.  But they still don't have the vast sound-stage of a truly open-back set of headphones.  A lot of people say these are a bit weak in the bass department.  These aren't Beats.  The bass won't overwhelm you, but it is solid and clear.  Some songs where I know the bass is loud, i turn down my amp in anticipation.  I like protecting my hearing and you can actually feel the air of the bass on certain songs.  The midrange is a bit inconsistent.  There are odd spikes that soften over time(I will discuss burn-in later).  Some parts of the midrange sound recessed, and other parts overemphasized.  The highs are clear and balanced with the rest of the sound spectrum.  All-in-all, these are a really fun pair of headphones.  No part of the spectrum is ignored.  And often times, you will hear things you have never noticed in a song before.  I have never heard some songs sound so interesting.  "Wake Me Up When September Ends" by Greenday is an example of such a song.  For the most part, these cans are exact in their delivery, so good audio sources and good audio recordings will be critical when listening to these.  Some of my less inspiring digital files are left nearly unlistenable.FIT:  Often times when I review headphones, I'll just say, "comfortable for continuous use".  AKG K550s need a LOT more in-depth discussion regarding fit.  I have never used a pair of headphones that required such precise fit.  First off, these cans are out-of-the-box designed for big heads.  With a little bending of the headband, they can be modified to fit smaller heads.  If you lose the seal, the sound quality goes down the toilet.  Much like IEMs, these full-sized cans require a great seal to deliver the intended sound, bass especially.  I think the design/fit would be greatly enhanced by increasing the padding in the rear of pads.  Angled kind of like the Q701s.  As big as these are, and as reliant on seal as these are, it is a big oversight to not add features that enahnce the seal.  For me, these work great b/c I have a big head.  But if you got a little noggin, then be prepared to do some bending.BURN-IN:  Placebo or real?  I have wondered if I just got used the sound of a pair of headphones or if headphones really changed over time.  I've always believed it was a combination of the two.  UNTIL NOW.  These headphones are the greatest evidence that burn-in is REAL I've ever heard.  When I first got these, before even burning them in, I listened to them.  And the sound was so odd that I almost gave up on them.  There were odd spikes and sometimes ear-piercing peaks.  The electric guitar in songs sounded just horrible, scratch and distorted.  But like all headphones I get, I decided to burn them in.  I first used medium volume and put my music library on random.  These cans I think can greatly benefit from white and pink noise, although I didn't use that method.  Even with the medium volume burn-in, i didn't get the results I wanted.  So I cranked up the volume on my amp to max and burned them in for and additional 50+ hours.  Most of my issues with these cans disappeared.  There is still a note or two in the upper-mids that spikes and hurts my ear, but I hope this goes away in time.  The electric guitar sounds a lot better now, even the loud strumming electric.  I would highly recommend burning in these THOROUGHLY at loud volumes before judging these cans.CONCLUSION:  These are not the best headphones in the world.  I will use them at home some times to mix things up, but I will use them predominantly for use on the road.  And for this purpose, it is my opinion that these are the best headphones.  Great soundstage, great representation of the entire frequency range(minus a couple of upper-mid spikes), and SEALED(not just closed).  I recommend them for a good all-purpose headphones.  If you plan to only buy one set of headphones and use them for everything at home and on the road, then this is a good option.  If you listen to a ton of electric guitar music(especially strumming wall-of-sound electric guitar), like speed metal, I highly recommend you stay away from these.  Although, this is changing over time as songs like "Paradise City" by G&R; and "Creep" by Radiohead are sounding better after a thorough burn-in.  "Tom Sawyer" by Rush is sounding amazing.  I haven't heard drums sound this good.*UPDATE*As I am traveling for work, I am away from my home set up.  But I have received my Asgard and Bifrost from Schiit.  So I have finally gotten to test these cans with a decent amp/dac combination.  The Asgard/Bifrost combo has a very warm sound signature.  My set up now: laptop to SPDIF optical to Schiit Bifrost to RCA to Asgard to AKG K550.  Absolutely amazing.  Source material is sooooo important.  And by source material, I am counting everything before the AMP.  That includes the music files and the DAC.  People stress headphones and amp, but they forget how important a good source is.  Garbage in garbage out I say.  Anyhow, I digress.  With this setup and a mild equalization change to favor bass and reduce the upper-mids(4kHz-8kHz), the AKG K550s have THRIVED!!!  These cans sound so NATURAL.  A guitar sounds like a live guitar (both electric and acoustic).  Drums are fast and thunderous.  Vocals are resonant and textured.  The sound stage is absolutely incredible now.  I am raising my 4 star rating to 5 star.  Mind you, I've considerably burned these in also.  These cans as I've stated above require an incredible amount of burn-in.  These cans are now playing everything I throw at it.  VERY versatile.  Even the upper mid spikes are going away if not completely gone.  If you are to own just one set of cans, these are them.  These cans thrive with a good set up, but will work with a bad one too.
$SUMMARY.: Great for SEALED, requires significant burn-in time!

It's basically a Logitech USB headset plug with the mic and speakers attachments chopped off.PROS:1.  It is cheap and easy to install(PnP).2.  The audio produce is amplified so it is louder than the standard laptop/desktop sound card.3.  The audio is fair.CONS:1.  The audio while loud and clear is a little chalky.2.  The USB just hangs on the side of the computer.3.  You will not be able to hear audio from the speakers while this is plugged in.

$review_text.: I was skeptical about a wireless headset delivering true 7.1 surround sound but the reviews seemed solid so I took a chance and I have to say, I am blown away. The earcups reduce outside noise and the 50mm drivers perform well beyond my expectations. The dual band wifi keeps the connection solid and the sound quality is amazing. Comfortable to wear for the 4-5 hours of gaming I get in every few days. The bluetooth feature allows me to answer the phone without taking my attention away from the movie I am watching or game I am playing. Dual volume controls so teamspeak is not too loud while enjoying the full immersion of the games/movies sounds. Slap on a SDK Oculus Rift and you feel like you;re in the game!I've owned dozens of high end gaming headsets and replace them pretty often (thanks to an overactive german shepherd puppy's chewing habits) and these are by far the best I have ever tried. I would highly recommend this setup!

$REVIEW.: I've had the Dell XPS-420 for almost 5 years - Q6600 processor and came with Vista
 Upgraded to Windows 7 when it came out, and most recently to Windows 8 Pro

 Reinstalled Windows 8 to this Samsung 830 SSD drive and the XPS-420 is almost as fast as my 15 month old Dell XPS-17 laptop which has a Core i-7 processor


 I put this same Samsung 830 drive in the laptop also

 Both have 8GB of ram.Laptop XPS-17 //  XPS-420Processor  7.4  //  7.1RAM  7.5  //  7.1Graphics  5.5  //  6.5Gaming  6.5  //  6.5Primary HD (SSD)  8.1  //  7.7Overall  5.5  //  6.5The dell laptop has a mobile Intel Core i7-2630QM which has some special boost feature, as does the Nvidia video card, so I suspect the Laptop ratings might be better than shown


 The video card in the XPS-420 is old - an NVIDIA GeForce 8600GTS, and was cheap when I bought it some years ago.The whole point is that the XPS has new life, and boots very fast with the SSD - from about 2 1/2 minutes (Windows 7 install was getting cluttered), down to 25 seconds


 I'm very pleased with both computers - no need to buy new!I wrote this because I researched for days about whether to upgrade the XPS-420 with SSD (it does work), and to Windows Pro (works fine)


 If you need more info, respond to this review and I'll write more.

I also ran h2testw_1.4 on it and found no errors.The pros to this drive are...- Definitely being capless..


I've owned many USB's over the years, and I've lost quite a lot of caps so.- Over 50 dollars cheaper than the top performing flash drives(a bit more expensive than Winten I believe, but Winten had horrible reviews so I chose to go with this)So, I think this could be a reasonable solution if you are good at losing caps like me, and  you don't add data to your flash drives very often.

$REVIEW.: Made of glossy-both-sides cardboard. Easy to write on with a ballpoint pen but if you want to use a fountain pen or roller ball with liquid ink, better use a paper label. Also, if you have a rubber stamp with "Media Mail" or "First Class" don't use it because the ink will smear. Use a sticker or write with a ballpoint instead. The cardboard material is thicker than a picture postcard but not quite as thick as the cardboad that comes with a new man's shirt. No internal padding, so the mailer is not as stiff as heavier and considerably more expensive ones I have been buying from Office Depot. However, I have been using Netflix DVD rental service successfully for years and their disk mailers are just flimsy paper, so I conclude that these mailers are very safe for mailing your disks even without the internal padding. The inside is glossy smooth, so it will not damage the surface of your disk. Overall sealed dimensions of the mailer are 6 inches x 5-15/16 inches. Unsealed dimensions are 6 inches x 7-5/8. These mailers are designed to mail disks either bare or in a paper or vinyl sleeve; there is not room inside for a plastic jewel case. The flap is securely self-sealing; just remove a paper strip to expose the adhesive and press the flap closed. The flap incorporates a perforated zip strip for easy opening of the package by the recipient. The description of "50 pack" is a bit misleading. A full pack of these contains more than 50 mailers so I received the quantity of 50 loose; i.e. not in sealed packaging; however that is not problem for me.For calculating postage costs: each mailer weights 0.6 ounces empty, 1.2 ounces with one CD or DVD with paper sleeve, or 1.8 ounces with two disks in paper sleeves. The postal rate structure has gotten more complicated lately... so much so that even the postal clerks can get confused. Your most accurate source to calculate postage is the website: [...]. Within the USA, you can send these mailers first class cheaper than media mail, but there is a surcharge over the letter rate. The mailers are defined as packages instead of letters because they are (1) square, and (2) contain a rigid object (so they have to be hand-canceled). Right now (5/31/2011) the first class letter rate for two ounces is 64 cents, but the first class package rate is 84 cents. Letters sent outside the USA can go first class international. These rates vary by country, but once again there is the surcharge to be paid. For example, first class international letter rate for 2 ounces to Costa Rica is $1.76; package rate is $1.96. For Australia: letter = $1.82; package $2.02. Parenthetically, there is a big stink going on now because the USPS has let Netflix pay the letter rate instead of the package rate for their zillions of DVD mailings.

$review_text.: I bought this for a little side project I found online. It's all set up and seems to work just fine, but it runs quite hot (on the UNO around the location of the power supply jack). This is my first experience with Arduino, so I have nothing to compare to; I've got an UNO, Ethernet Shield, and Relay Shield bundled together. I tried running with a 12V Netgear power supply at first after checking acceptable tolerances at the Arduino site, and then with the $6 9V supply suggested on the order page. Both run hot. I read a few posts online stating it could be the Ethernet Shield drawing too much power, but I'm not sure what to do about it yet. Fun project so far, hopefully I don't melt it trying to figure out how to keep things cool. For what it's worth, the one I received came with some little freeware/hacker/Arduino stickers and the board only, I didn't receive any cables or extras.

$review_text.: This is a very handy device. It's an audio enhancer, which is to say, an aid for hearing. It can be hooked directly to a device, like a phone or iPod, which is nice. Even better, it can be hooked directly to a TV. What this means is that if you live in a noisy home, you can just put in your headphones, and hear the vital part of your whodunnit without having to try to shush everyone around you...and miss the vital part because you were being so loud shushing people!As an added bonus, you can use it as a sort of old-fashioned hearing aid. With the earbuds in your ears, and the device in your pocket, you can amplify the sounds around you. The device claims to reduce background noise, and it does do that some, but it is not a real hearing aid, which amplifies only the frequencies that you need amplified. So, do not even consider buying this as a replacement for a hearing aid.Nonetheless, I have found this to be a really handy thing to have sometimes, and I keep it plugged in, under my TV.

$REVIEW.: I read the reviews here AFTER I purchased the router.  Bad move; when will I learn?Things I like about this router:1) love the USB port where I can plug in a memory stick, an external hard drive, or a printer2) coverage was pretty good in my two-level homeThings I don't like1) to get the full functionality of the router, you have to install a bunch of software on each computer (wired or wireless) and it does not let you opt out of some of the crapware like "music labeler."  It makes you install all of it.  You can then go into the control panel and delete some of it.2) no status lights, just one single idiot light but it doesn't give you specific statuses.3) connectivity is totally flaky.  Weird.  For instance, sometimes the wireless computers will be connected fine while the wired computers have no connectivity.  Sometimes the wired computers are connected and the wireless ones are not.  No rhyme or reason.  And sometimes, it has strange limited connectivity ie I can open my Gmail email account but in the next tab, cannot open my Juno email account.  Or the Lowe's site will open or the Home Depot site won't.  What's up with that?So, bottom line, I took it back and bought at D-Link DIR-628 for the same price.

$REVIEW.: It will fit a 14 inch laptop no problem but a 14.1 is not a good fit. It dances around but for $7 bucks not a deal breaker. It's a bit slipper so keep that in mind if your looking for something like this as a stand only case. This sleeve is good for those people looking for extra padding while laptop is in the sleeve while traveling in a book bag.

$REVIEW.: I have had a few Samsung blu-ray players and honestly...I do not like them at all.  This one is just okay, and I am done buying Samsung Blu-rays.  I have had three now and all of them seem to work in slow motion.  A lot of lag with Samsung, which I am surprised because they usually make great products.  Aside from the lag I deal with it because I already had one of those wifi adapters from my old Samsung and didn't want it to go to waste.  Overall if I had to decide again...I would go with the other Blu-ray I have in the house, the Sony BDP-S370.  This I feel is a whole lot better then the Samsung BD-D5500.  Like I said before, the Samsung does its job for the most part (playing netflix at night while I lay in bed trying to fall asleep), but if I had to buy it again...I wouldn't.***Updated Nov 29 2012***It is now almost December and I would NEVER EVER EVER EVER buy another Samsung DVD player.  I only bought this one because I had one of those WIFI adapters for the back.  ALL Samsung Blu ray players that I have owned suck.  This one lags when on Netflix and the titles and pictures on the main menu won't show up sometimes and freezes.  I contacted Samsung multiple times without any help at all.  So forget Samsung products forever for me.  I have had 3 or 4 Blu Ray players that really screw up on Netflix especially.I have 2 Sony Blu Rays now and have NO problems.  Go Sony...forget Samsung!

$REVIEW.: This is my 3rd backpack in 3 years and I was ready to give up.  I'm 5'6&#34; tall, female, and average build - this backpack is very comfortable and the right size for me.  I have in it: my Canon 60D, 4 lenses, battery charger, several lens hoods, and all the little gadget accessories you normally carry with - and there's room to spare.  The only thing that didn't work out was that I had planned to carry my MacBook Air with me and I guess I didn't measure right - it won't fit in the laptop compartment without sticking out a little too far.  No matter, I love this backpack so much that I would never return it for a larger one just to fit the laptop.  Also - the outside pockets on the sides - finally someone has designed them for easy access for the things you access often (camera cord, remote, etc.)!

$review_text.: I've had these earbuds for over a year and they have held up great. The sound quality is very good. Clear, strong base and excellent treble. I don't mind the "Behind the neck" style cord that others have complained about. I don't use them to run or workout. I find that most in-ear buds are not good for active sports. I would recommend a different specialized headphone for working out with. The Sony earbuds have a faulty cord made out of some very delicate soft rubbber. The cord on these are very durable and after a year look just like thaey did when I bought them.In my opinion they are the best earbuds under $50.

$review_text.: Updated 24-Feb-2014I gave this a 5 star review after using it for 2 weeks but now that I have had it for several months I had to down grade the review to 3 star.  Something is just horribly wrong with the network connectivity in this drive.  Almost every week it disappears from my PC and I cannot connect to it.  Yet if I unplug it and then go into the setup again the drive reappears and is fully functional.  So far no updates have been released by Seagate so I can only assume this problem is beyond repair by a firmware update.  BTW I am using windows7 64bit version.Initial ReviewAfter having my HD crashing on my home theater PC I lost about 1.4TB of Movies and TV shows.  At the time I sat there in total disbelief.  After a few hours of despair it started to dawn on me that I was not even sure of exactly what I had lost since some of the stuff had been on there for more than 3 years.A few days later I got a new drive, no more WD green drives for me!  I then started to transfer some stuff back to the HTPC.  With that done it was time to make sure this doesn't happen again so luckily I got my hands on a Seagate central.Now that I have the Seagate Central I am using it to back up my HTPC and other pcs on my network so that if this should ever happen again all my stuff will be backed up.  The best part is that I don't have to worry about doing the backups, all my home pc's are now in the set and forget backup mode and since the network drive is available 24/7 any PC can use it when it wants to.The Seagate Central was a breeze to hookup, you just plug it into the Ethernet port and under networking a option appears for a new storage device.  I clicked on that and it opened up a web browsing page that gives you access to the settings within the Seagate.  The first thing I did was set the IP to a fixed IP.  I really don't know why so many people complain about that issue!  If you're seriously setting up a NAS drive why would you want it on a floating IP, it should just be fixed to one of your highest IP's in your DHCP range.  Anyway with that done I set up some folders and then shared them on the PC. Next I mapped the network drive and set up acronis software to do the backups.It's now two weeks later and it's working perfectly, I can even stream a 1080P movie from it without a problem.If you want peace of mind then buying this drive is a no brainer, especially when dealing with multiple networked PCs and its also great for allowing the whole household to share music and videos.
$SUMMARY.: Works but has major network issues.

$review_text.: For the price, I would not buy this thing new.  It is not wireless, though not unexpected.  What did bother me is that it does not detect which TV aspect ratio should be used automatically.  You end up having to use the TV remote to change aspect ratios to match the DVD or TV show or whatever.  Wired Netflix worked well...it uses an older menu system though...and it runs somewhat noisy...but it does what it is supposed to otherwise.  Loading is fairly quick and so far it remembered where my show was stopped.

I have been using it daily and recording on the same disk.  So far, no problems and EXCELLENT quality.  It is like watching a live broadcast with the bonus of fast forwarding through the commercials.I do have to remember to Format each time I want to tape over something which you need to get use to after having only VHS.At times, I have taken the disks out of my new DVR and played them in a much older DVD player.  No Problems with the disks.  I do finalize the disk in the new DVR before playing back on the older DVD player.So, Great Product.  Yes, I would buy again!

$REVIEW.: This Onkyo TX-NR616 worked perfect for my needs.  We have a small home 1900 sqft.  My wife and I both watch TV and have our laptops next to us while we are watching.  I wanted to be able to play the music off of our laptops, play or stream BluRay, DVD movies and watch Direct TV and have everything with surround sound.  I always hated it when watching TV the program would go to commercial and the volume would blast me out!  No more with our new receiver the sound is always perfect no matter what we are doing.  Here are some tips.  I did a lot of research before I bought and saw that one complaint was that there was no detailed manual shipped with it.  I went to the internet and downloaded the pdf manual before I even ordered it.  I read through to make sure it did everything I wanted.  I got it on Friday and set it up Sunday.  I had my laptop right beside me with the manual ready.  Everything went smooth except for the addition of the wifi dongle.  I have my TV through DirectTV and my internet through Comcast.  When I was setting up the wireless because DirectTV also has internet available the dongle was not seeing my comcast wireless network.  I disconnected the DirectTV box and connected the Onkyo directly to the TV by passing the DirectTV box.  Once I did that then my network showed up, I put in my network key and everything else went smooth.  I love the 40 FM presets.  I really love that the sound stays even no matter what TV channel I am on and no more loud commercials.  I love being able to play Youtube videos, Windows Media player music, ITunes, Pandora, BluRay movies and HBO TV movies in surround sound and everything works great.  I have only had this for a couple of days but I love it. Oh yes and because of the hdmi inputs I cleaned up a mess of cables and it is a much cleaner setup.  I am a very happy Onkyo owner.

 Also the list of items that you are supposed to receive is incorrect

 It states that you receive an ethernet cable in the package, but there wasn't one
 If you don't have all the items in the package then you need to revise the information on the product description


 It also kept losing the signal, so I had to reset it each time I wanted to use it
 Overall, I was far from impressed with the product
 Maybe that is why it was on a lightning deal from Amazon?  In the process of packaging it back up to return to Amazon!

$REVIEW.: This grip fits and works fine.  It has the functionality expected (buttons, use of 2 rechargeable or AA batteries).  It is much cheaper than the Canon grip.As far as I can tell the claim that this is the same mould as the Canon grip is correct.But that's where the trouble starts.  This grip is very bulky, the Opteka and the Canon alike. It is too large for small hands.  This is not Opteka's fault of course, the Canon grip suffers from the same problem.  I don't see the need for this, it has extra surfaces that aren't required for the battery fit to provide grip, but they overdid it.  It is much larger than e.g. the grip for a Rebel XSi which is usable with both small and big hands, IMHO.Second, it might be same mould, but it either is different plastic or it isn't treated the way. While color and texture are good, it has a very strong chemical smell right out of the package.  I attribute this to skipping some finishing step (or using different plastic) to make the price difference. Having said that, color and texture fit the 40D perfectly.Another nitpick is that the product label says "with 2 BP-511 Batteries" but what you get is 2 "Opteka branded BP-511 compatible batteries".  This isn't the same thing and the product label should be more strict about it.  I didn't test these batteries but at the very least this damages your resell value compared to original equipment batteries.So - should you buy this grip if you need a grip? Yes, price/performance is much better than the Canon grip which is pretty much identical and comes with no batteries of any label.However, my concern about bulkyness is real. If you have small hands (I am thinking of petite women's hands here) you will probably end up leaving this thing in the bag.  The capability to run on AA batteries can be invaluable in the right situation so it's worth having in the bag. What I'm saying is that it is not as clear a win as the grip for e.g. a Rebel XSi is.  As I mentioned, this critique applies to the Opteka and the Canon grip alike. To my knowledge a slimmer grip is not available for these cameras.

$REVIEW.: I've been lugging around an older (heavy) aluminum tripod for years. I finally decided to treat myself to a set of carbon fiber legs. What a treat this baby is!The tripod came from Amazon in it's original box with a UPS label on it. It wasn't sealed (tsk, tsk Amazon) but fortunately the contents were still in the box. Open the box and there is a nice tripod carrying case with everything else inside. The tripod comes with a strap, spike feet, and wrenches to attach them, in addition to the carrying case. The strap can attach to the carrying case or to the tripod itself. The case also has a carrying handle.I extended the legs and mounted my trusty old Arca-Swiss B1. It's a lot of head for this tripod but I have no intention of replacing it as it's given me years of use and still functions like new. A lighter ball might be more appropriate for this tripod, however, and if I were buying one to match with the type of photography I do now, I would strongly consider theInduro BHD2- that's how impressed I am with this product. The tripod is sturdy, well made, and light in weight, even with the relatively heavy Arca-Swiss head on it. It reeks of quality from the magnesium alloy spider to the leg locks to the easy to use oversized twist collar. I have a Gitzo carbon monopod, and in comparison the mechanism for extending and retracting the leg sections is far superior. The legs are fixed and they loosen and lock in place with about half a turn. There is also an attachment for the strap, a bubble level, and a threaded mount.Clearly, Induro has positioned itself to compete with Gitzo. Induro prices are considerably lower for comparable gear in terms of specs. After shopping around and comparing, the choice was easy for me.

$review_text.: I purchased a battery grip for my Nikon D5100, and read reviews that the cheapo $3 + $5 shipping EN-EL14 knockoffs work fine in the battery grip as long as you use them with an authentic EN-EL14.  However, I didn't want to be in a pickle if my EN-EL14 was out of juice, and I had heard of problems with charging the knockoffs in the standard charger.  I decided on the Wasabi battery kit because the reviews tell me I can trust them to work and they do!The charger has a red LED for charging and a green LED for charged, which is very straightforward.  The batteries charge in less than 2 hours and last longer than the Nikon EN-EL14 (1300 mAh vs 1030 mAh).  These are decoded batteries, so they will also work in the camera individually - you don't need a battery grip.  Wasabi Power's 3 year warranty on the kit tells me that they are prepared to stand by the quality of their batteries, and that means I can probably trust them to be in my camera or battery grip and not damage the camera.The DC adapter seems like it will be very handy.  It all seems well built and the batteries fit snugly into my D5100.  This kit is great for someone who doesn't need the Nikon-branded batteries but who doesn't want to take the risk of spending only $3 on a battery that doesn't have a warranty.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome substitute for Nikon-branded EN-EL14!

 great sound, (much louder when using ac adapter however)and runs on  4 "AA" batteries (i used rechargeables)

 problem i had is that it would not play back music from my ipod touch 5th gen without the music "skipping" like an old vinyl record at times (and it wasn't bluetooth range issues)


 i don't know if i got a bad one

 didn't want another as i've tried way too many bluetooth speakers out that just weren't loud enough

not sure this one would be loud enough running on batteries outside


 too bad it loses that much volume from ac to batteries


when plugged directly into ipod it was fine, but then what's the point of bluetooth......so close to perfect


 i hated to return it, the price was so good
but it's no good to me if the bluetooth doesn't work right.

$review_text.: I bought this item for my Sony SD camcorder with low expectations

 I'm glad, in this case, that I was completely wrong!Sony wants a small fortune for only 1 battery


 I got 2 batteries, the wall charger & the car charger for less than HALF of what Sony wants for a single battery.The batteries charge quickly and hold charge well

 They are definitely longer life than the battery that came with my camera.This combo is an absolute must if you have a Sony camcorder.10 stars!!!

$REVIEW.: I read many reviews that point to the weak points of The Kindle lighted branded covers that are held by two tabs inserted into two slots on the left side of the Kindle but decided I wanted the real deal anyway. My cover arrived on a Saturday afternoon from Essex - one of many companies you can get stuff from through Amazon.com. When I first attached mine that evening it fit fine and I thought I might have gotten lucky. On first inspection the cover was seemingly well made, attractive and I would hope it to be far sturdier than a naked Kindle. Two days later, Monday, the bottom tab was coming lose and the Kindle wanted to come off the tab completely. I was but another to have run into the same problem. I'd only had my Kindle for 10 days prior and carried it around gingerly as it is not a rugged piece of electronics by any means. I thought the cover would help which it does. After putting it into the cover I was gentle with it but the tab came loose even then. I read where some said Velcro tabs would hold it in place and could see the merit but you have to find the thin variety to work as there is not enough space for the thicker stuff. I found that the bottom tab can be bent in and down with a pair of small needle nose pliers to give it a bit more angle to hold the Kindle but that doesn't fare for long either. As far as the light - it isn't anything to write home about but I suppose would do in a pinch as it would be better than nothing. My opinion of the cover is it looks and feels nice in the hand but the engineering, implementation and design factors don't match the immediate aesthetics. Did anyone carry one around and use it in real life for a year before it was given a seal of approval? How long will the elastic cord that holds it closed last? I had to return the thing.I contacted Essex twice to no avail and then Amazon who said they would refund my purchase via Essex, who confirmed as much after I contacted them a third time. My concern is the cover is warranted for a year and they decided to refund me rather than replace it. Both are options at their discretion but I am happy to take it and try another cover, the Marware Eco-Vue Leather Kindle Folio. It isn't held in by the tabs or the little elastic corner bands. I shall see.

$REVIEW.: i'm a cheapskate so i decided to get a computer speaker system instead of paying hundreds for surround sound system for my tv.This is a great system for a small room like mine. THEY ARE LOUD!! if you're worried that it won't be loud enough or that it won't have enough bass then don't be. having the volume half up is extremely loud.for under 100 bucks these are great. i found them better than the logitech z313. They come with the rca cable to plug into the tv. sound is very clear and crisp. great for jazz, rock/metal, folk. amazing for video games, my neighbors are going to hate me. its great that you can control the volume and bass. i wish the design and colors were different but oh well. very pleased, like i said i you have small room then this system is perfect

$review_text.: The inexpensive jack was a perfect solution to getting the RCA output of my VCR to work with my other S-Video based video components.The DVD and Satellite receiver are S-Video but the VCR was RCA.  Even though I have a video switching Onkyo receiver, I still had to swith the video input selection on the TV when I changed between S-Video (Sat Rcv/DVD player) and RCA sources (VCR).  Too much switching for the young kids.Put this little baby on the RCA output of the VCR plugged it into the Onkyo and bingo.  No more need to change the TV video input - it's all S-Video now.Picture is great.

$REVIEW.: Mac users should know that when you plug this camera into your router for the first time (via ethernet cable) it will get the highest available address that the DHCP router can assign.As a preliminary, you might want to open the Network Utility and ping the highest addresses, eg 10.0.1.254 and find that it replies (it is the router itself) then try 10.0.1.253 and receive no response. If you do get a response try the next address down (252...251...)until you get no response. This "first no response" address is the one that the Panasonic camera will be assigned.For example, using an Airport Extreme with DHCP, it will likely get 10.0.1.253, with a Netgear router it will get 192.168.1.253.Once you have this assigned highest address, you can open a web browser on your computer on the same network and enter the assigned address (eg. ...) and continue with the setup, including entering the wireless network information and password.Once setup is complete you can power off the camera and switch to wireless.My initial assessment of the camera was very positive. It has a relatively wide-angle field of view and provides a sharp picture in bright light. Its low light performance is poor.The biggest problem I have had is that it loses its DDNS address with the &lt;...> service after less than an hour. I have set the camera to restart every morning to get over some of this difficulty but it is still a pita. Its wireless connectivity to my AE base station, which is less than 30 feet away, is poor - typically below 30% strength if you look at the Maintenance-->wireless page in its settings.If I had the option, I would run this camera in the "wired" mode to eliminate this poor 802.11G performance. But then why pay the premium for wireless operation when you can get a simple, wired,  Panasonic camera for half the cost.

$review_text.: I have a home built Personal Computer that is about as large and complex as can be built. I started with Cooler Master HAF X 942 Case, Core i7 Processor, 16GB ram, dual Nvidia GTX 260 video cards, additional PCIx SATA controller, two add-on PCIx USB 3.0 cards, a PCI WiFi Adapter. (Bear with me, I am not trying to brag. My point being I have a whole lot of stuff and this PSU handles it.) Every single port on this PC is connected to something, I have 8 internal Hard Drives, 3 of which are 10,000 RPM in a RAID, Two 7200's in a  RAID, and three Antec "Easy SATA" hot swap hard drive caddies out the front that are always filled. Two Blu-Ray/DVD/CD burners. Every USB/Firewire/eSATA external Port is connected to many devices, including 2 USB 2.0 7-port hubs & 2 USB 3.0 4-port hubs. A total of 22 external external hard drives, 9 USB 3.0 & 10 USB 2.0 & 3 Firewire. A Firewire Canopus AVDC-100 Analog/Digital video converter. I have 5 large fans (230mm, 230mm, 200mm, 140mm, & large CPU cooler). Finally a USB webcam.A thorough calculation reveals that I can max out my power draw at about 985 watts. Normally everything is not used at once, but can be at times, especially at start up. You want to make sure you allow for aging of your PSU, over time it WILL degrade somewhat. Over 5 years it is not uncommon to lose 20% of the rated power. I carefully monitored the voltage levels on this PSU and when I installed it I did so with minimal components attached, just a 3 disk RAID and built in video. I then built it out with the full complement of devices and even with everything on and running I do not see even a hundredth of a volt change in output voltage . This is pretty awesome voltage regulation. I previously had a 650 watt high end Antec PSU in it and it was very strained even with one GTX 260 video card in it. With this 1200 watt Cooler Master a couple of my fan speeds increased by as much as about 10% over the strained 650. I am very pleased. It also looks very nice and it weighs a ton. I am an electronics engineer and I can tell you it is true what they say about PSU's, you can tell the quality of the PSU very much by the total weight. This is for sure the heaviest PSU I have ever held.I have read a lot of reviews on the Cooler Master Silent Pro Gold series PSU's. I have not once heard of a problem with the unit's functioning. That is very impressive. It has a 5 year warranty so it will certainly outlive this computer. This is also currently a very good price for such a fine piece of hardware. I should also mention that with all the devices I have in my computer I had plenty of power connections and I only needed to add one standard Molex 4-pin 2-to-1 splitter to hook everything up. This was because I had a few drives connected with a single piece SATA data/power connector that used the old Molex connector instead of the SATA power connectors. I also have two USB 3.0 PCIx cards that required a Molex power connection. I ended up with a couple free SATA power connectors. This is pretty impressive as in the past I always needed a bunch of extra connectors/dividers to connect everything up. Cooler Master provides a good supply of connections. I was a bit disappointed that I was left with a fat extra video card connector laying loose in the bottom of my tower. Strangely, 3 of the four video card power connector groups come hard-wired to the PSU, with only one of them modular. If you like a tidy arrangement this is a minor flaw.I can't think of a better PSU and it comes in many other sizes to suit your needs. The build quality and packaging is impressive. You won't be sorry you bought it.

It has the largest keyboard of any of the USB keyboard cases, and is larger than the Bluetooth keyboard--all advertised by Amazon. However, the USB keyboards are ALL the &#34;wrong gender&#34; to attach to NOOKs, which ALL function like storage devices, so all have USB male end adapters; plus, for whatever reason, there apparently is no such thing as a connector with 2 female ports to attach 2 devices with male plugs (ie, this keyboard & a NOOK). The manufacturer would make a good bit of money, were they to make a keyboard with a USB FEMALE port, b/c this is also the best-constructed, highest quality USB keyboard/cover of all of them, even better than the Bluetooth keyboard/cover.

 After connecting to our attic antenna, all stations come in 100%.I'm using mine in a relatively new quad-core running Vista 64


 Media center recognizes the device and I'm able to record, play, watch live tv and burn DVD's through Media Center


 I found the Pinnacle software to have a few sound issues so I only use MC

 Recorded Rudolph in HD and burned a DVD last night for my daughter and the quality was amazing.The only issue I have is the FM Radio is not recognized in Media Center and has issues in the Pinnacle software

$review_text.: I was looking for a higher quality in-the-ear headphone solution, and a set of Sennheiser CX-680-i's were on sale over at Newegg. They were competitively priced (or so I thought, until I came over to Amazon). A couple of my co-workers are big fans of Sennheiser, so I thought I'd give 'em a try. I found the CX-880-I's to be in my price range, read the customer reviews, and hit the 'ol "TAKE MY MONEY" button.A week later, they arrived, along with my Creative X-Fi Go! USB Sound card. Set everything up, and played with the three different seal options that came with the headphones. I found the medium set to be perfect (I must be average, ear-wise). As other reviewers stated, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT FIT! I then proceeded to play multiple songs of differing qualities, and noticed a low-level whine. Turning up Windows 7's bit-rate, and using the "Optimize for Headphone" options available fixed this.The good stuff:They sound amazing, with terrific clarity. You will hear things in your songs that you didn't know were there, if you were using crap-quality headphones before.The construction is sturdy, with no quality defects or imperfections that I can notice so far. The placement of all features seems to be in an optimal position.The packaging came with a considerately optional clip for mounting these bad boys to your shirt or shorts or whatever your thing is.The bad:Not really anything to mention here, other than I was inattentive and got the i-Device compatible version, even though I own no Apple products.

I use it as an extra battery - it's just the same as the one that comes with the camera and it's a cheap accessory for the extra convenience. What else to say about a simple battery? Well... it's cheap - so go for the genuine panasonic instead of messing around with a generic battery that might work as well if lucky... or just be really bad.

I will give it a true test when Skyrim comes down in price, but Diablo III doesn't even cause it to elevate settings and Arkham City at maximum with full DX11 effects only stuttered once in 3 hours.  My first Nvidia card and I am impressed.The OC software is simple to use and monitoring temps and fan speed is easy to do.  A little spendy, but warranty protection for an OC'd card and the superior cooling are worth it.  When the price drops I may likely add a second card in SLI mode.

It's like a mini i5 since there are 2 cores which are both hyper threaded.Awesome!
$SUMMARY.: Great processor that handles just about anything!

$review_text.: The Tamron 28-75 has become somewhat of a legend due to its phenomenal image performance for the price.  Yet, when you take price out of the equation, this lens still holds its own surprisingly well against the top-dogs from Canon and Nikon costing anywhere from two to four times the price of the Tamron.  So far, I've found this lens is consistent with what I've been hearing across the Internet: image quality is at a professional level.The lens looks and feels like most Tamron lenses I've seen, plastic but reasonably well built.  The zoom ring is at first a little snug in operation, but I suspect it will loosen a bit over time.  The focus ring rotates during automatic focus operation, but that's really a non-issue in my view of things.  However, everything still feels generally solid and of quality construction, in contrast to the loose and rattling lens barrels, zoom and focus rings of the Pentax "kit" lenses: the 18-55 and 50-200.  Autofocus operation with the 28-75 is a bit on the noisy side, but I've found it to be fast enough so far.  What's most important, it's been spot-on in typical shooting situations (a welcome relief to the Pentax DA* 50-135 f2.8 I had to return due to poor autofocus performance and resultant soft images).  Some comparison shots between this lens and the Tamron 18-250 taken in the 28 to 75mm range show that the 28-75 is clearly a sharper lens and maintains that sharpness nicely boarder-to-boarder.  The 18-250, my basic walkaround lens, is a strong performer in that lower range, but it is simply outclassed by the 28-75.  Contrast and color saturation is also superior to the 18-250.  Interestingly, color tone with the 28-75 looks to be ever so slightly warmer.  I've found that CA (chromatic aberration - purple fringing) is present in some rare shots near the boarders such as with the edges of overhead florescent lighting in a gym where that lighting is overexposed in contrast to the rest of the picture, but I haven't seen it appear in many other situations where one would expect to find purple fringing.  At f2.8, I've found that this lens still produces impressive images, especially at the long end, but not quite up to the sharpness at f4.0 and higher. So far, I haven't really noticed any issues with vignetting or distortion.The 28-75 is also a full-frame lens, meaning that it is designed for cameras with a 35mm film frame-sized sensor, but it will also work on the smaller APS-C sensor of the Pentax D-SLRs (dedicated APS-C lenses such as the Tamron 18-250 will not work properly with a full-frame sensor).  The positive of using a full-frame lens with the APS-C sensor is that the smaller sensor benefits from being more in the lens' "sweet-spot, " that is, the potentially softer/distorted boarders seen by a full-frame sensor for a particular lens are just outside the reach of the APS-C sensor.  Kind of makes one wonder why all D-SLR lenses aren't full-frame.Considering the limited lens options for Pentax D-SLR owners, especially higher-end products, this is certainly the lens to have.  While the Pentax APS-C factor of 1.5x, and an effective focal length of 42 - 112.5mm is perhaps not quite wide enough for some shots, it does, however, work great for general use including portraits and low-light interior shots without flash. A nice surprise I found with this lens is that it has an aperture ring which means I should be able to use it on my old Pentax ME Super film SLR for a true 28-75mm focal range.  As I continue to be impressed with the 28-75, I'm hoping that the new Tamron 70-200 f2.8 due out in a few weeks will be in the same league as this legendary lens bargain.

$review_text.: Do not buy any of the Pogo devices. This is not a NAS, it is a device that you have to have a software license for each machine that connects to it and you have to use an Internet connection to be able to use it. For about $100 you can buy a real NAS that looks like another machine on the network, has 1TB of space (for slightly more, you can get an NAS with 2TB), can be accessed by Windows (XP and above), old (PowerPC) and new (Intel) Mac with OSX of 10.3.9 or later, or Linux (using Samba), and requires no extra software license (it supports Windows Networking directly), and it works whether or not you have an Internet connection.I know because I have both one of these and a Buffalo NAS with built-in hard drive, I have Windows machines and an old Mac, and the Buffalo "just works" with all of them, and will be cheaper when you realize this is just a sharing device (that requires a per-machine license) and does not include any hard drives, you have to connect them to it and install a software driver on each machine you want to connect to it.

$REVIEW.: I had previously used the Griffin iTalk for the G3 an G4 iPods and while an excellent product, the sound quality was 8 bit and the range was approximately 6 feet.The Tune Talk is a significant a step as the change from the original iPod to the video iPod.Sound Quality - Excellent.  With the autogain off the recording is completely hiss free.  With autogain on some his and distortion is introduced but it is acceptable.  Stereo separation is good, excellent when you consider how small the microphone is.  The two quality settings - high and low - correspond to 44.1 kHz (CD quality) and 22 kHz.Format - the files are in the WAV format and run about 10MB per minute I high quality mode.  These can easily be converted in to mp3 or any other format.Features - The built in Autogain makes recording in large rooms or even outdoor settings practical.  I have used it in small classrooms (10 person), large auditoriums (90 person) and outdoor theaters (200+ people).  The quality is exceptional considering the small size.  There is also an external input for either an microphone or line input (1/8th inch stereo) that allows your iPod to serve as a storage device for a higher quality recording setup.  I used a direct input from one iPod to another using a male/male cable and there was no noticeable loss of quality.  I am sure if you put the recordings on an analyzer you would see a difference but my ears couldn't tell.  I have used this to digitize old analog tape recordings with excellent results.Controls are minimal.  Plug it into the dock connector and your iPod automatically goes to the record menu.  Press the Play/pause button and you begin recording.  Once recording begins the center button acts as a pause.  Once your are done, scroll the clickwheel to "Stop and Save."  When the save is complete, you go to a menu with your recording.  File names are a date/time stamp.  If you have the Tune talk already attached but you are doing something else (listening to music) you can go straight to the recording menu by pressing a button on the left of the Tune Talk.  On the bottom along with the autogain and line input is a mini USB connector that allows you to power your iPod while recording.  Recordings eat battery life fast.  At full power you can get about 90 minutes of recording from a battery.  After hat you run the risk of running out of juice during the disk write operation.  Belkin includes the cable (nice) and a plastic holder that allows hands free recording (also nice).The uses for the Tune Talk are only limited by your imagination.  I use them in an education setting for spoken homework and recording lessons.  I have also used them to record meetings, record plays and even notes to myself.  The Tune Talk would make an excellent device for an on the fly Podcast.  Combined with Apples GarageBand you could record, mix and post a podcast in a matter of minutes.Highly recommended.

The package I got did not have any Verizon SIM for me to use the 3G modem; the W-Fi works fine.So, I take my Chromebook to a Verizon store to get my SIM and get it activated. Although the unit does have a Verizon 3G modem installed and electrcially active, they were not able to activate the service. It seems that the Elec. Series Number (ESN) for the modem is not recognized by the Verizon service so the SIM would not work. Appariently, from what I hear, the Chromebook is to new for their Tech. Service to help.They (Verizon) suggested that either I take the unit back to Amazon/Samsung and get a replacement, use a Mi-Wi unit, or just use the Wi-Fi. I am holding off on going to ANY Phone company to supply me with a SIM that will work with the unit.I will continue to use my Chromebook with Wi-Fi only.

$review_text.: I'm an experienced software developer and bought this machine to use as an everyday dev machine


The software I write utilizes the GPU for calculations, and thus I needed something with some real GPU power

The CPU and GPU speed have completely exceeded my expectations


I've used the laptop for a number of weeks and it has been rock solid


Also, even under serious load on the GPU and CPU, it still remains fairly quiet


This is in a typical office environment.Although it doesn't get used much by me, the audio does have a transient &#34;hiss&#34; problem

It's not problematic, but it is noticable from time to time
Unless you're doing serious audio processing, I wouldn't let that sway your decision.My one true irritation is that, for my work, I needed a setup that didn't exactly match any of the available G750 configurations
Primarily, I needed to add a bit more memory, but didn't want the $700 adder for other things that would go unused

There are four memory slots, and I really hoped that only two would be populated, each with 8G DIMMs


Instead all four were populated with 4G DIMMs - meaning that adding another two 8G DIMMS gave me only 24G

The removed modules are now sitting in a drawer

It turns out that 24G is sufficient for me, but this was a real waste
It's doubtful that ASUS saved anything of significance by doing this and it just makes them look clueless


This laptop is most certainly not an entry-level machine, where saving pennies would make the difference in a sale


In my opinion, this was not an appropriate and reasonable decision on ASUS's part.All said, thought, if I had the need, I'd buy another G750 in a heartbeat.

$review_text.: I bought my mom a different lapdesk and bought this one for my wife. She works from home so a lapdesk turns our couch into her work desk. You should understand she works for one of the major cellular/mobile companies and works 9-11 hours a day, sometimes 6 days a week. So this lapdesk was seeing a lot of use, but within 3 months, the seam had started busting and there were little white Styrofoam balls all over the couch and floor. Nothing a piece of duct tape won't fix, but it's still a bit of a hassle.Besides that problem, it's a pretty good lapdesk. I think my wife would have been happier with the one I bought my mom, but she really needed a light and wanted a cupholder, unlike my mom (a casual computer user), who didn't want the light or cupholder. What this lapdesk amounts to is a bean bag chair with a hard/weighted top for your laptop. The light is pretty useful too.It also has a zippered pocket on it. My wife keeps her wireless mouse in it and I guess you could put more in it if you wanted to. It's an okay product, but seems like it should have lasted longer without having to break the duct tape out.

I understand they couldn't sell a device like this using bluetooth for $15, but I guess we'll wait to get a radio frequency device with the next generation of cameras and I'll just have to save up since the new device could likely be more expensive.Overall, very useful, and quite an improvement over mechanical/electrical cables.

$REVIEW.: We purchased two Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofers for our new home, to fill out the sound for two large rooms with in-wall or in-ceiling 7.1 speakers.  Size and shape were both top considerations, as we wanted to integrate the subwoofer into a window seat in our great room, so the unit had to be approximately 14" tall (precluding several other, bigger, more powerful choices).  Price was a secondary consideration -- but we do appreciate good sound, and would have happily paid more for better sound, if we could get the packaging right.As always with Amazon, shipping was very efficient and the speakers arrived in good shape long before we were actually ready to install them in the new house.  Set up was no-brainer easy (as others have noted, the lack of an LFE input is easily worked around by turning the crossover level of the speakers all the way up).  We routed a 20-foot RCA cable along the base of our hearth prior to installing hardwood flooring, so the terminal end could be routed behind the drywall to the final installation spot, tucked into the window seat in the very corner of the room.  Remember, though, that as a powered subwoofer, you'll also need a close-by AC outlet.Now, for the sound:  it's really good -- crisp, not excessively boomy unless you turn the internal volume way up, and surprisingly capable of churning out satisfying bass in a very large space.  Our primary listening environment is a large great room, approximately 32 feet by 24 feet, with a two-story cathedral ceiling.  The primary speakers are Audioplex 8" in-wall speakers, driven by a Yamaha RX-663 receiver.  Most of our usage in this room is for "ambient" music during the day, running in the receiver's 7-channel stereo mode -- and the Polk PSW10 admirably "fills out" the bottom end of the sound, enriching it without being distracting or boomy.We also use this system for family movie nights, in concert with a Samsung 52" A650 LCD monitor.  Once again, the PSW10 does a fine job "filling out" the bottom end with solid bass, even keeping up with the action-adventure movies my kids prefer.  As a minor beef, I actually have had to get up and turn down the sub's volume during a couple movies because the level that works well with music is a little too much boom during loud action sequences... which I suppose says something about the sound levels this little speaker is capable of.Overall, for the way we live (lots of music played at moderate volumes, regular "home theater" sessions with the whole family on the couch), the Polk PSW10s have proven to be a great buy and a great value, with satisfying performance in a right-sized package.  A true audiophile might be disappointed, but for real-world, moderate-volume usage, these are great little speakers for a great price.
$review_summary.: Solid sound in a small package for a great price

$review_text.: The mouse seems to be very robust. The performance is awesome, even for gaming (I used it with Battlefield 2). The scroll button has a great design, that works great even for long webpages.As opposed to other mice I owned this is not lightweight, which adds to the feeling of being a very robust mouse.The mouse came with a mouse pouch and two duracell batteries.As soon as I connected it to my laptop, it worked great. I am using Windows 8. The best of all, as advertised, it works great even on clear glass!!! I am so happy with this product.
$SUMMARY.: Simply the best mouse I ever had
