$REVIEW.: The Vanguard Up Rise II 46 backpack is not for the amateur photographer who has bought a Rebel T3i and is looking for something to carry it in.  No, this backpack is designed for the serious upper end prosumer, and professional photographer.  Its a large, roomy backpack with a large amount of storage space and some very useful and practical accessories (the rain protection, for example.  It's comfortably padded, and is definitely a backpack for those who expect to be hiking long distances with a fair amount of camera equipment. If you are looking to go into the Yellowstone backcountry, or a long day up in the North Woods, this backpack, for the most part, will do you right.Two things do stand out that could stand to be improved. The backpack has a "Trapdoor" that allows for relatively easy entry into the interior of the backpack to retrieve your camera without having to stop and undo everything. Its a nice idea, especially for those opportunities for a fleeting shot, but the design is suboptimal to me. It's a little too open and I am concerned that in inclement weather, this is going to be a a danger to the camera equipment within.The other thing is the laptop space. I do appreciate that they have thought to have room for a laptop, a lot of professional photographers like that flexibility in working on photos away from home. However, the position of this laptop space means that it will be pressing into your back. I think a little more padding in that space might work better. Personally, my netbook won't cause this issue, but a 13 or 14 inch laptop will.Overall, though, I am extremely pleased with it. This is not a backpack I'd use for a casual trip out to the city to shoot photos. But for a longer expedition to the Badlands, the North Shore, or to the Rockies? Yes, this is the backpack I will use, even given its flaws. The benefits and advantages of being able to easily carry a lot of equipment are not to be understated.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this RAM to go into (as of right now) the most recent model Macbook Pro (late 2011, 15" 2.4 ghz Core i7) following the instructions available from Apple


The installation was a snap, the system recognized the RAM immediately, and there have been no issues moving forward

It really does make a world of difference in how the computer performs, so it is highly recommended, especially at such a great price compared to what Apple offers when purchasing it built in.There are cheaper equivalents to this product available from Amazon, but the iffy brands drove me to the much more well known Corsair at only a moderately higher price

Highly recommended, just be sure this is the right stuff for your computer!

$REVIEW.: This card is amazing, plug it in and go


I have a Dell Inspiron Vista Home premium with a stock  350w power supply


I thought it would not be enough but it works NO PROBLEM! For what its worth the card increased my Vista Experience index from a 5.5 to a overall 5.6
I mean every category is 5.9 but the Memory Ops is 5.6 and that lowers the total


My machine is a 2.4ghz quad core with 4gb of ram

Its like top of the line.It breaths new life into older games like Far Cry and after some adjusting FC2 (very high settings)60fps! looks pretty good too.I did have to up date the drivers but no biggie.I paid $83 including overnight shipping."Folks Try My Product"?

$REVIEW.: First, to answer to critics' reviews I'd like to say that one shouldn't expect total quiet from the noise cancellation feature. The way how cancellation works -- by creating counter- noise sound for certain range of frequencies-- works great against street, plane type of noise.Though I'm not Sony's fan, I was pleased with sound quality and quieting I enjoyed in noisy flight. I can actually "hear" how noise-cancellation kicks-in when you turn switch on: noises fade, really amazing!I paid ~$[..] for these headphones. Only problem is somewhat stiff band, but this is an amazing replacement for your walkman/mp3 headphones. They flatten and fit well in my laptop pocket.Ran 4 hours on a new AAA cell and didn't need to replace battery it yet. Given the price --- 5-star!

$REVIEW.: Very pleased so far.  I'll update after I try to "wash" it.There are no bubbles because it doesn't attach to the full screen.  It attaches to the sides of the screen, along the border of the page.  Very effective.  If you have a white iPad, you should know that the border will be covered by the black border of this screen.  If you have a black iPad, no problem.I like the fact that it only attaches on the sides.  There can be no complications from that.  I also like the ability to wash and replace it.The screen area has a matte finish, which I don't really like.  I got used to the shiny screen of the tha glass on the iPad, but I'll get used to it, I'm sure.  The finger slide is not as smooth as on the glass of the iPad.  There is a bit to friction.  I'm sure I'll get used to that, as well.To me these are small inconveniences for the comfort of keeping the screen scratch free.

$REVIEW.: This mouse is too big for my hands. To be fair, I have fairly small hands, but it is supposed to be a &#34;one size fits all&#34; mouse. Also, the angle is not as vertical as the picture leads. It's actually very far from truly &#34;vertical&#34;. That is to say, my wrist and arm are no where near a &#34;neutral&#34; position. It is moderately better than using a conventional mouse, but my arm is still rotated. Combined with the too-large size of the mouse this mouse may not be the every day solution I was hoping.  The large size not only causes my fingers too much spacing, I have difficulty reaching the top thumb button and the scroll wheel. We'll see if I get used to it. Conclusively, it is somewhat better than a convention mouse, a good bit better than the way, way oversized traditionally &#34;ergonomic&#34; mice, but it is not the perfect mouse for my wrist and forearm pain.

$review_text.: I ordered this next day delivery and paid extra.  I did not get it next day.  It took two days.  Just sayin'.  I'd say this is worth the money, just for the Kindle case and the sleeve.  If you were to buy those individually, they would cost two or three times the price of the bundle.First of all, got it out of the bag and it stinks.  I am hoping the smell goes away, and turns out it did almost right away.The Kindle case is nice; however, I don't understand why all the Kindle cases are so awkward.  They're hard to get the Kindle in and out and it's just unnecessary.  The Smart Cover for ipads is the way to go.  It attaches magnetically and none of what you go through with Kindle cases.  So thumbs down on it from that standpoint - but, it is decent and it will protect your Kindle.The sleeve is very nice.  You would pay $20 plus for this, and you need it if you are going to take care of your Kindle.  Your Kindle in its case will fit very nicely inside.The screen protector ---- you may as well just throw it in the trash.  Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.  Which is the case with most screen savers.  I bought a Moshi screen protector for my ipads and my ipod and I have NEVER seen such an amazing product.  You slap it on and no bubbles.  No fuss.  It's wonderful.  So, soon as I tried this screen saver and couldn't get the bubbles out, I threw it in the trash and I ordered The Moshi for Kindle.  You won't regret it.  It's worth the money.I didn't need the rest of what's in the bundle, but it's great to have a stylus pen and new earplugs.  You can always use those.  The rest I am sure I will use.  Always nice to have extras.A VERY NICE SURPRISE... I own an Energizer Energi, which is a battery charger for traveling, which I paid $80 for and I use for my Ipad.  I was wondering if I'd have to buy something different to use with the Kindle. Turns out, one of these accessories fits into the Energi!  I was so impressed!I'm giving this a four rating because of the smell, the late delivery, the unusable screen protector.  I'm trying to be fair.  I originally gave it a three, and then I decided because of the cases it probably should be rated higher.

$review_text.: This adapter works as it should on all of my FD lens (I don't have any FL's). It is as pictured. It fits the Nex and FD lens very solidly. To save stress on the camera, I recommend you mount the lens to the adapter first and then the adapter to the camera.  The aperture will adjust manually. It's easy to get on and off the lens and camera. It took me a little practice to get it to work consistently, since to me the markings are not clear. There is a dot on the non moving part to line up with the red dot on the lens, no problem here. The lock and open positions have a dot and an arrow. One would think to lock or open rotate in the direction of  the arrow, but it's the opposite, the dot signifies the position. Line the dot on the rotating part with the dot on the fixed part and that is the position. What I do is to set the adapter to open, mount the lens (red dot to dot on non moving portion of adapter) then line up the lock dot to the dot on the non moving part and then mount on camera. Sounds a bit complicated but it isn't.  Once you get the hang of it  there are no problems. If you can't adjust the aperture manually on the lens, then it isn't in the adapter correctly.  It's cheap enough that I may buy several and just leave them on the FD lens to speed things up.

$review_text.: In terms of functionality, I really like this keyboard

It is a quiet keyboard and has a lot of nice features on it including programmable function keys as well as other special media keys

 Specifically, you've got volume control as well as media player control, a window switcher, zoom buttons, and a calculator shortcut among others


 If you already have a Logitech device such as a mouse (Personally, I have a Logitech M570 to go w/ this keyboard) that features a "unifying receiver", then it makes sense to get a Logitech Keyboard


 The whole "unifying" thing basically saves you a USB port

 Also, the receiver is small

In terms of comfort, I like that the keyboard has three different height settings
The wrist pad is also quite comfortable

 So far I've been using this for a couple of days and it is very easy to use and it did not take me long to get used to the "wave" design


 It was not intuitive at first, but my hands got used to it quickly

The quality of construction appears to be good
 I can't find any problems with it anyway


It is sturdy and and well-made

 That has been the case with the Logitech products I've purchased in the past


I have a PC, so I'm unable to comment on compatibility with Mac computers

 All in all, a nice addition to my home office which my wrists will thank me for.

$REVIEW.: I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting.  I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime.  It is a very versitile lens.  Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light.  I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities.I frequently use this lens for family portraits, the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject.As others have stated, this is a heavy lens.  It doesn't have Image Stabilization (IS) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images.  I use a beefy monopod for my best shots, although I have a lot of handheld gems...If you are tight for cash, this isn't the "one lens" that does it all.  If you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits, THIS is that lens.

$REVIEW.: I've owned a few LCD TVs in my lifetime, and most of them were between the 19" through 32" size variety, so this is my first "big screen" TV. I was blown away when I first fired up a standard DVD using Blu-Ray Upscaling. The picture is so amazing, it's hard to think it could ever be better. In my 12' by 14' master bedroom the TV looks HUGE! The menus are user friendly and easy to navigate, the magic wand remote works awesome, and the quality of picture is just amazing. I got lucky to get this unit for $679.99 back in July. I have not seen it drop price again. You may get luckier during this holiday season. Very happy with my investment.

$REVIEW.: There are 3 filters, one is "circular" polarized so when you rotate it, it supposedly eliminates glare on certain items I haven't tried this but I'm told that is what it's for. Additionally, it adds saturation to your photos so be careful when photographing things you don't want overly saturated. Honestly, I think it's linearly polarized but I have no way to prove it. As for the pink...I haven't a clue what it's for. Judging by the doctored "sample photos" it would seem it's for indoor artificial lighting and the Clear is for UV reduction. Which, from what I'm told, it makes your skies seem blue-er. Truthfully, I'm an amateur photographer so all this stuff is Greek to me. Something I think is important to note is that they have a metal ring, they fit my NEX-5 E-mount 16mm and 18-55mm lens great and I have no complaints

$review_text.: Just plug in and go, and you're set. My husband is a school teacher, and sometimes the equipment in his classes futzes out. The projector comes to the rescue in seconds, and doesn't take any effort at all to set up. He plugs in his USB, and keeps on going as if nothing happened.Couple of notes:1) Everything on the USB needs to be either an image (JPG, TIFF, etc), or a movie file (mpeg-1). All other files are useless when using the functionality. They include a version of the Arcsoft media converter 3.0, along with a registration key, so that it's fully usesable. It's very intiutive software to use. Just drag and drop your media, and let 'er rip. If you're on Mac OSX, use any software that you'd ordinarily use, and convert it to MPG format, and you'll be golden. I'm running Parallels on a Macbook Pro running Leopard. I raced the OSX side (using Visual Hub) and the Parallels side (with arcsoft running), and of course the OSX side won, because it's not running in a virtual environment. That being said, Arcsoft only took like 20 or so minutes for the movie Dogma.Yes. You can drop DVDs into Arcsoft to convert it to USB. Pretty sweet, huh?2) The image AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS! I was sitting on my bed, projecting the image to a wall, and watching the movie from the USB port. If you want to imagine a perfectly tiny, comact setup, this is it in spades. Anyway. When I tilted the projector upwards so that it would show up higher on the wall, the image automatically adjusted itself so as not to be distorted in any way.3) The on-board audio is fine for a smaller room, but if you want any serious sound, hook it up to a PC speaker, or your audio setup you use right now. In my bedroom, it was no problem. If it's a small-ish conference room, I can't imagine it being any trouble either.4) Yes, you can hook up your iPhone or iPod Touch, but you have to buy the media cable that gives it audio and video out, so it'd essentially be like you're hooking up the iPod to your TV.5) It only comes with VGA input for computers. In other words, the audio isn't going to carry through to your projector. It'll come from the computer.6) To project powerpoint from the USB input, you go to PowerPoint, save the presentation as a JPG, and go from there. This is a GOOD thing in my eyes, because all those stupid "cute" effects that people throw into PowerPoint presentations will not carry through. Use powerpoint like it's intended to be used: as a visual help for your presentation, and NOT AS YOUR PRESENTATION.7) You will quietly find /reasons/ to use your projector. I'm not kidding. It's a fun little tool to have. I can already envision parties in my head. Turn down the lights, close the curtains, and pop up some popcorn, and sit around watching movies that take up the space of my WALL. Which is so freaking cool. Unlike traditional projectors, the image being sent to the white walls was startlingly clear.8) While playing movies on the USB input, the remote behaves exactly like a DVD player's remote. You can even fast forward up to 32x. Pretty cool if you ask me.The creators of the product have made this to be a fun thing to have around the house. The manual is not read. It's looked at, because it's all done in pictures, not words. You can download the full PDF of the manual onto your computer, but the base manual is very cute, and small, and meant to be unintimidating.In other words, don't think of this as a Serious Expensive Projector that must only be used for Serious Things. Play around, and see what it's got to offer. Use it for fun stuff. Impress your friends with having awesome movie nights at your house. Most of all, use it! It's not meant to sit in the box, and be an expensive decoration. It's meant to be used!

$REVIEW.: Love this product.  Really is useful for when working outdoors in lots of light.  In the past I would have to either find shade or cup my hands and it did not work well at all.  The product is high quality.  Works great with my rebel 500D (T1i).  There is  optical adjustment in the eye piece that helps those of us who need a little help seeing.  My only compliant is price.  But there are no alternatives out there that I am aware of.

$REVIEW.: This is my first SSD so coming into it I wasn't expecting much of a difference but was totally shocked at how fast it boots windows, loads up applications, installs software,etc.. I installed the 64gb SSD onto my HP Pavilion 2000 Intel Core i3 laptop with about 40gb left over to install programs and for personal storage. I didn't really need the 320gb use of space the laptop came with anyway. I have a dedicated htpc/media server for enjoying my media content for that purpose. So what storage I need is on the laptop or stored in the cloud. I highly recommend this for an upgrade so much that I plan on purchasing another one for my htpc.

$review_text.: I am an amazon believer. I think they are great.I have been a customer for a long time and purchased many items from them. I totally have always been satisfied with quality and price.Now let me get to this product. It is overpriced and poor quality. Some rightly stated it should be sold in a dollar store.At $10 top price.  I still wouldn't be satisfied.As far as the odor is concerned, I was a chemist and the odor indicates inexpensive (cheap) coating formulas. Cheap chemicals don't often meet industry standards.  China has no industry standards unless the importer requires and states the compliance standards. I would return it but I threw out the packaging. China has been challenged when it comes to products for children using toxic materials. Do you remember all the sheet rock panels were contaminated with formaldahyde which was not only toxic but would corrode wires and boxes in the areas of placement.It was a diaster waiting to happen. Toxic loaded paint on childrens toys.I could go on and on but I can't totally blame amazon But it would be interesting to see what their reaction is?If nobody watches the store where are we going to wind up?On a technical point all chemicals in plastics migrate out in time. Example, medical tubing must us top graded low migrating materials with less health effects

$REVIEW.: I am not a photographer by any sense of the imagination! I always was interested in it, but never got the chance to really do anything about it. I am into digital scrapbooking and my husband is a graphic arts designer. We wanted a camera that could work great for our digital work and our webpage designs.And can I just say, "This camera ROCKS!"It's so easy to use, its small, not at all heavy, and it can do soooo many more things than a simple point and shoot. If you want to get into photographing more or if you like to do things with photos, this would make a great upgrade for a novice. I am so happy I bought it.One thing to think about, that I didn't do... GET A CAMERA bag! I didn't even think about it when I bought the camera, and I had to go out and get something to store the camera and the chords together. Also, remember that it doesn't come with a memory card. So, just remember to consider those things in your camera buying budget.

 No chest strap, would might be nice, but holds everything, and the green lining is snazzy, too


 A thread did come loose on one of the straps the week I received the backpack, but I sewed it back up, and nothing else has come loose since


 It's not one of those super-industrial-protective backpacks-it's not 2" of foam all around the laptop area, and you can't go dropping the backpack on the ground with a laptop in it and expect everything to be fine, but it's enough for light protection.

$review_text.: Never actually used it to play a blu ray as I don't own any. Dvd's look the same as when playing on my computer.Pros:1. Theoretically does just about every streaming service you could need. (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, DLNA, Pandora, etc.)2. InexpensiveCons:1. The Viera Cast menu is slow.2. The Netflix menu is also slow.3. Netflix playback has black "flashes" where the video disappears and seems to be resizing?-- This happens as often as a few times a minute. I tried setting a static IP, didn't help, put in an SD card and formatted it with the player, didn't help. Tried hooking it straight to the modem. Didn't help. I consistently get 20+ Mbps downstream, and have streamed 2 HD streams to computers simultaneously just to make sure. It's definitely the player. This is enough of an annoyance to me to return the player.If you want something to do Netflix streaming well, look elsewhere.

I am happy that there is a little bit of thickness to the case itself so I am comfortable putting my laptop in my purse or backpack and not feeling like I have to be super cautious with my bag.

$REVIEW.: I bought 12 of these for a computer training lab. It's hard to get any mouse at this price and I thought the extra cuteness would be fun. It did take 25 days to receive them as they are shipped from Shanghai, China (not Hong Kong).When I got them, I connected each mouse individually to make sure each one worked, checking left, right, and center wheel buttons. They all worked flawlessly. I am very pleased with them. The only thing that could have been done better was the packing. These are packaged in thin, non-sealed plastic bags. Several of the mice had slid out of their bags and were a little scuffed or scratched. The lot of them came wrapped together in bubble wrap and placed in a larger plastic bag, not a box.I cannot comment on the durability of these yet, but I must say they do feel light and kind of cheap. But I didn't expect exceptional quality at this price.The headlights do light up, like in the picture, by reflecting/refracting the one blue LED in the center of the mouse. There are not individual bulbs/LEDs in the headlights. The tail lights light up when the red LED under the mouse is lit up (only when you move the mouse) using the same type of refraction.Overall, a nice mouse for the price.

$review_text.: [I have posted some pictures of the product]I have two main concerns when buying wireless input devices: range and battery life.  Sure there are other concerns - I list some of them below - but if you have to sit three feet from the computer or the batteries only last a week, you're not going to be happy no matter how good the other aspects are.The Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 keyboard and mouse combo is all around a pretty nice package.  The items which I considered are below.  The primary issue with which I am not concerned is how well the mouse works on different surfaces.  My use was in my living room on a couch.  The mouse worked great on soft fabric...PROS:- Great range: Over 15 feet in my use, with many electronic devices around.  Dongle was essentially within line-of-sight, partially obstructed by other USB devices.- No "Magic Buttons": I think the wireless devices that require you to press a "Connect" button are almost gone.  Thank goodness!- Dongle size: Small - about 3 or 4 cm out from the USB port- Dongle storage: Dongle attaches to bottom of the mouse, turning off the mouse power.  Great for people taking this with their laptop.- Keyboard size: Very nearly perfect.  Full-size keyboard but not too long.  Top to bottom, the width accommodates all of the buttons and leaves a slip-resistant wrist pad at the bottom.  They accomplish this by shrinking the size of the F-keys and the shortcut keys.- Keyboard weight: Substantial enough for resting on your lap but not a burden.- Key feel: I prefer a firm keystroke; I don't even mind the old clicking keyboards.  I really dislike "mushy" keyboards.  The MS 3000 keyboard is about halfway between my rejection point and my ideal.  The keystrokes are quiet and smooth (no sticking noted) but there's a slight "divot" feel as the stroke bottoms out.  I consider this design a positive as it should satisfy most (if not quite all) keyboard users.- F-keys: programmable for other uses.  "F-lock" key forces them into standard F-key mode.- Shortcut keys:  I don't use these, and so I didn't install the software.  But I count 21 shortcut keys, plus the programmable F-keys.  With Windows Vista at least, the three volume buttons (volume up, volume down, mute) controlled the volume without the software.- Mouse size: Built for an adult's hand; not too small.- Mouse batteries: Very nice - requires only one battery, but accepts two, presumably for less-frequent changes.- Mouse buttons: Five, including the scroll-wheel.  I did not use the software, so the standard three-buttons (two plus scroll-wheel/button) were fine for me.  Scroll wheel ran smoothly without any clicking.- Mouse texture: Smooth plastic on upper-half with grip rubber below that.CONS:- Keyboard lights: No caps lock LED (most annoying), and no num-lock LED.  There's a battery LED right above the number pad, but mine did not turn on.  Perhaps it's a red one for low battery.- Key angle: Now, this is nit-picking.  The keyboard seems just a bit "flat", with the keys only slightly angled differently from each other.  Personal preference on this one.- Mouse shape: OK, maybe a positive since it's "generic".  I prefer the mice shaped for the right hand.  This one is like half an egg.Overall, I have no significant complaints with this product.  I'm not particularly fond of the mouse shape, but then it's not a deal-killer either.  The keyboard might be adjusted somewhat; but then, maybe my preferences won't work for other people.  I can't speak about the battery life, but I can say that the range is fantastic and the mouse has a nice feature by requiring only a single battery to function.Overall rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars - a great product.  Put in that caps-lock LED and maybe shape the mouse a bit and this would be an all-around 5!

$REVIEW.: This is really a great shoulder pad; I bought it as my new Dooney and Bourke purse was SO heavy and the strap so narrow that I couldn't stand it on my shoulder. I loved the purse and refused to give it up so luckily I found this product. That said, the cushioning is awesome but I wish it was a bit narrower and that the pad was also black. It looks really odd hanging down when I'm not using the shoulder pad, and my purse is red so it stands out like a sore thumb. The top is slippery and so the purse strap moves around a bit too much, but all in all I am thrilled with it.I just wish I had a choice in width and could get the pad in black. I might use a permanent marker on it so there's not two colors competing with the red. For luggage or anything you lug, this strap is awesome. I can see that the glue isn't the best but so far it's not been a problem. Buy it, you'll like it.

$review_text.: This camera works decently, but may not be the best for everyone depending on your intended use.  I am using it to check up on my dogs at home while I am at work, and it does that quite well.  I would not buy this for home security purposes however, there are other better camera systems that are better set up to record activity and email valid alerts.  The audio quality on this camera is poor to fair at best and the still-shot picture quality is about the same.  I have a similar camera (identical looking) from D-Link and the set-up and user interface are more user friendly, and that one I alternate uses to monitor activity at my front door or monitor the dogs' activities while at home alone (and it is still not what I would consider to be a security camera either). I have had problems with this Belkin camera just disconnecting from my network and having to be re-setup again when I get home, so I wouldn't consider the dependability to be to be as high as the other one either.  I found that the night vision works pretty good on this. In the end, I found that the best use for me for this camera is just as a second camera that I can check to see what my dogs are up to.  I could not set it up for any other use that was practical and had the motion sensor set up with email alerts that didn't flood me with emails throughout the day. I think if maybe Belkin would invest a little bit more in their application and interface, this could be a much better product.

$REVIEW.: Once everything was all set up and running properly, this device is great. I use it as an access point, the wifi is strong and everything I've plugged into the ethernet ports work without a problem.When setting it up the software didn't recognize the device. I followed the instructions in the Amazon comments and disabled my wifi adapter but that didn't end up being the problem. I run Ubuntu in VirtualBox and the virtual ethernet port and wifi was interfering with the Utility softwares ability to recognize the AP device. Once I disabled those I was able to set everything up with ease.I don't have a cd drive in my computer and ended up using an external drive I had at work. I found the software on Edimax's website as well though, I just thought it didn't work because of the VirtualBox problems but it is the exact same software and should work fine if you don't have a cd drive. I searched for &#34;Edimax EW-7228APn utility software&#34; to find it.

$REVIEW.: I posted this about the Transcend 32 GB SDHC card that was getting trashed in reviews by Canon owners. It also applies to the Sony card (read down), and readers may find it helpful in evaluating SD cards in general.The 1-star threads on the Transcend are like watching a committee of blind men describing an elephant. Unsurprisingly, no one has the complete picture, but a lot of Canon owners think these cards are bogus. SD card technology is very complex, the Class system is often misunderstood, and there is a long history of compromised cards appearing on eBay -- or even from reputable dealers who have been hoodwinked. Kingston cards are most often faked (or taken from the midnight production run); that's because Kingston has about a third of the flash card market and doesn't forge their own chips, but any manufacturer can be spoofed. It doesn't pay to buy cheap cards on eBay or less reputable sources.An SD card contains a controller chip and flash memory chips, even the microSD versions. Realize that SD means Secure Digital, and that security comes from crypto managed by the controller (MMC cards didn't have that bloat, but Hollywood DRM requirements made sure they faded). The controller can be pretty powerful: the Samsung SD controller is a 32-bit ARM TDMI chip with 128 k of code space -- that's cell phone power. It handles I/O and fading (when the card slowly wears out its NAND sites after about 100,000 hits so writing is randomly distributed and kept track of), the factory self-test, and a host of other functions, but it can also be programmed to report a false storage capacity. Sometimes the firmware on the controller or its crypto or something else on certain cards leads to problems with certain hardware, as it has, for example, with the Samsung Galaxy III and maybe the Canon cameras. Usually the card is found to confirm to SDcard dot Org specifications and the hardware is to blame, but you never know.To test the actual capacity of your card, use H2testw, which is free. It writes the full amount of data to the card and then reads it back (this nukes whatever was on the card). This can take more than an hour with a 32 GB card but it tells you if the card indeed holds 32 GB or if it has problems. H2testw also gives you read and write speed numbers, but it's unclear whether the numbers are for random read/write, or sequential read/write or a mix. Sequential write is what photographers and videographers most care about.Sometimes a Class 6 card might appear to test faster than a Class 10 card, when using computer read/write tests or even in a camera that wasn't designed with higher capacity cards in mind. That's because such cards use smaller block sizes (there's no cache on an SD card). Explaining the significance of this is getting too far into the weeds for an Amazon review, and modern devices and their firmware should not have that limitation.To test random and sequential read/write speed, use CrystalDiskMark, also free. Run the full suite; it won't take long. CrystalDiskMark requires that the card be formatted, and the most reliable way to do that is to use the free tool from sdcard dot org. A 32 GB card will may report 39.9 GB before formatting and 29.8 GB after; don't worry, you haven't been ripped off.Unfortunately, there's no easy way to read the manufacturer's ID off the SD card, even in Linux, to determine who actually made the card, because you have to have the card connected directly to a motherboard; an SD-to-USB adapter won't work because it doesn't pass through disk data, and that's what's in nearly all computers. But what do you care, so long as the card's as big and fast as claimed?

$review_text.: Cant really say anything more than it works. I use it with a usb flash drive and have had no problems. I haven't tried keyboards or mice or large external drives. If i need a mouse and keyboard or more then 16gb flash drive odds are what ever  i am doing could be done way more efficiently on an actual computer.Only gripe i have is i wish that the tablets port was on the side so it was easier to hold when using apps that will no rotate the screen. This with a usb drive attach sticks out a good 5-6 inches so holding it right side up while laying down can be a pain. This is more of a tablet design gripe than for this product.

$review_text.: I bought this to store my games to take with me for this deployment to Afghanistan.  My first tour to Iraq I bought one for the same purpose but although it was the same brand, it only held 15 games and was not expandable.  I still used it for my second year in Iraq and my last tour in Afghanistan.  Add it up, 3 years in hot, desert, dirty, windy and dusty environments and it still looks great and works perfect.  I upgraded for this deployment to this one and so far, I love it.  This time I got to bring all of my games.  If I run out of room, it is very easy to add more pages that you can actually buy right here on Amazon as well.  It's holding up well to the environmental challenges and is doing a great job at keeping the elements away from my games.  This is also a great way to keep all your games nice and neat and be able to store a large number of games (with the instruction booklets) without giving up a lot of space on a shelf or in a drawer.  I would definitely buy this again, but I don't think I will need to for quite awhile because it is very well made.  Hope this helps with your decision.

Its comfortable for long nights of gaming, for CS the triple shoot button works great. The quick sensitivity changing button also works great.  I never really felt the need of weights in a mouse and these dont have them anyway.  I think its just a way for companies to charge more for a mouse.  The 500hz also helps - can actually tell a difference in game. Overall good build and great for gaming.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my Garmin nuvi 2595 (5 inch screen).  I realized it was a bit expensive but I thought why not buy a nice case made for the unit and not have to worry.  Well, it isn't worth it.  The unit is very snug inside the case, almost too snug.  There isn't that much padding (it is not a hard shell case by any means) and for protection there is only elastic on the short sides, although the leather does overhang a bit.  On the front side the leather is doubled when closed, but the back is only one thickness.  It seems normal to put the unit in with the screen up, so that is where the better protection is.  I think this case is fine if it then goes directly into a bag or purse.  But I am not sure what would happen if it were dropped, probably OK, maybe not.  Of course there is no storage for all of the other bits and pieces for the unit, which I prefer to have as I travel and plan to bring the unit along.  I am looking for a better solution for storage and transport of my new GPS.  It is some bother to return this one but I think it will be worth it.  I have ordered the 'Lowepro 5.0 Navi Shield, Black' by Lowepro, found on Amazon.  It looks like it will be a better overall solution...But it isn't.  It is well made and fits the GPS fine, but it is a bit crammed to get the cord and all the rest inside.  Also, the suction cup piece does not fit, it is too high either way one puts it in, so closing the case causes some strain on the zipper.

I also like that they give you three different sizes of buds to customize your ear for comfort.  It also comes in a cute and stylish case but the case is a little floppy and it can be a pain to wrap the wires around the case although it keeps the wires from tangling.

I did not use the enclosure, rather went with a more stock look (and the speaker enclosure is designed well enough for that to happen). I can't think of anything negative to say about them, installation was easy, and they truly sound awesome. I did, however, have to drill new holes in my Xterra for them to fit properly, and had to fabricate a seating for them (the speaker enclosures are really rather strange in this particular vehicle) but that is a comment more on Nissan than Rockford Fosgate.

My son is not a hard core gamer, but enjoys playing Minecraft and several different games on Steam.

$REVIEW.: After having owned numerous 'line-doublers' (all the way back to Faroudja upscaling my 480i sources to 480p for my first home theater,) and innumerable HDMI switchers, I have finally found a series that takes the alphabet soup of HDMI versions and handles it with aplomb while being the cleanest and most easy to use upscaler to 1080p that I've used to date. Add the Green Word to my two previous DVDO Edge units, and I am even happier.So, after having issues with HDCP handshakes, HDMI versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3a, and 1.3b not playing well with most autoswitching units--this product from DVDO does all of the above with aplomb.Want to take your upscaling DVD player, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, TiVo HD, Wii, and more and mix and match audio inputs to a single optical output? Done.Want them all at true 1080p (including your wee-little wii?) Done.Want to get rid of the "Sugar/Mosquito-Noise/Sparkle issue from compression of your HD inbound signal? Nicely done.Want to see everything pop better on your HD screen without looking artificially processed? Simply Done.Want power-on priority for various units in your system (the TiVo comes before the Xbox 360, and the Oppo comes before the PS3?) Again, done and done well.Add a simple remote, ability to tweak at will (should you even want to) and you have a massive winner of a product.My biggest worry was any effect I'd have on speed of play with the game consoles--no issue... It not only has a game mode but takes Wii-Widescreen 480p and puts it out at a solid 1080p/60 and looks great doing it.Films on Blu-Ray with 1080p/24 are stellar (minus the extra stars in the black sky from compression issues.)All in, I heartily recommend this product--and you'll note that I am fairly even in pans, middling reviews, and OK product discussions, but rarely give a rave.This is a rave and applause to the DVDO crew. Our household has three DVDO Edge units and counting now.[Consider this a laughter-and applause-filled standing ovation.]

$review_text.: I've had my iPod nano - 4GB for nearly a year. It was a Christmas gift. It's a nice little device. I have about 3.2GB of music stored on it and I use it nearly daily at work. I plug it up to my XP box at work and listen to my music all day while I work. My experience with this device has not been with out incident. I have had to restore it twice due to lock-up issues. It has lost all or part of the content on 3 separate occasions. I don't ever want to hear some MAC head tell me how good Apple products are. I've had XP running on my PC since it was originally introduced. I've had the iPOD for only 11 months. I've actually had more trouble with the iPOD in 11 months than I've had with my PC in 6 years (which included a system upgrade). You have to have iTunes to use the iPOD. You have to "Authorize" your PC before you can play any purchased music from the iTunes store. You can't transfer the music to the iPod until the PC is Authorized either. It's a simple step, true, but still annoying. But you are not limited to having to purchase music from iTunes. I download MP3s from Amazon. iTunes pick those up immediately and there is no need to "Authorize". Same goes for ripped CDs. My massive MP3/WMA library was also imported to iTUnes upon installation. The WMA files were converted to M4A format and stored separately for iTunes. So needles to say, I have music tracks now existing as WMA and M4A. M4A is MPEG4 and is not recognized by Windows Media Player, yet. iTunes does not come with the iPod, you must go to Apple.com, register the iPod, then download iTunes.The only things that come with the iPod are the earbuds, the USB cable and a little instruction sheet that directs you to Apple.com.

$REVIEW.: I hesitantly ordered pre-ordered this unit to replace a Garmin 800.  What I was looking for was a larger screen, easy setup and more that I cant remember right now.  The reviews have been far from positive so far with apparently so significant bugs with the software.  I've not had any of it,...yet.What I loved about this device, was how simple and easy it was to pair the included HR, cadence and speed sensors with the unit.  It was as easy as putting them on the bike with the included rubber bands.  The speed goes around your hub and cadence on the non drive crankarm.  I turned the device on and went for a ride and after about 15 seconds they were all registering on the device.  I didnt have to do anything.  Very niceOf course the very first thing I did when I got it was to connect and update to the latest firmware...maybe that had something to do with it working right.
$SUMMARY.: working well for me so far

$review_text.: This product has exceeded my expectations. After doing quite a bit of research it always boiled down to the same thing unless one goes with an expensive Raid zero external array with SSD drives and even then it does not take full advantage of the interfaces capabilities ability to lay down the data.In other words the hard drive and it's controllers for once are the weak link and bottle neck. Lol how the times have changed.I like many others are in the same boat in that we own MacBook Pro 2011 systems that have firewire 800 and USB 2.0 in addition to the Thunderbolt interface.Sadly USB 3.0 did not make it to these systems.Oh but is it sad?My research showed me that I would be lucky to get firewire 800 to lay down 70 MB/per second that is 70 Mega Bytes per second not Megabits.I read complaints about this drive not giving true Thunderbolt speeds and thought sure 120MB per second is not true Thunderbolt speed but it is still better than Firewire may ever hope to put out.So instead of investing in an outdated Interface I purchased this more expensive drive with the Thunderbolt interface.In a word it is awesome as in wickedly quick for what it is. I have achieved speeds of over 270 Megabytes per second and compared to the 27 MB per second I was getting out of USB 2.0 this is wonderful.If you look at the customer attached picture I have provided you can see a live shot of a back up being Performed with the Super Duper Software by the developer Shirt Pocket it allows you to create a bootable Back up for OSX via external drives and this drive is able to be booted from.In this picture you can see it was at 269 MB per second but was actually fluctuating even higher.One thing I would like to say is the Thunderbolt interface on this drive seems to take a while to get up to speed or at least report the speed and the more data that is being written to it the faster it goes.The connections are very firm and the cable does not get hot as some have described even when transferring hundreds of Gigabytes of Data.The Drive slides onto the interface sled and the two combined are thick the interface sled is vented and both can get warm ( Small wonder at these speeds )The interface sled has a magnetic base under where the bottom of the drive sits. ( magnetic how strange. )The interface sled uses a standard SATA connection meaning you can slide the drive off of it and insert a regular notebook or notebook SSD drive and connect to it and run it I have not connected one of my SSD's to it yet but will and will take pictures and report the speeds achieved.You will need to put something under it to keep it even but a couple of adhesive Silicone Cabinet beads used to keep doors from banging should do the trick.Alternatively if you have another Seagate external drive a less expensive model that ships with the USB 3.0 interface you can disconnect it from its 3.0 interface and connect it to this Thunderbolt sled. I have this and have tried it, it works just fine and allows me to have two drives for redundancy and one always securely stored while the other is attached and ready for use.FYI be sure to remove all of the plastic from the drive portion there is a protective plastic film that covers the drive all over it has to come off to allow the drive to cool correctly. Yes it is even underneath so pull the drive free from the sled to remove it.Over all I could not be happier with this drive it is incredibly swift, back ups that used to take hours now only take minutes including the virtual machine images of Windows and Linux Mint that are on the MAC I run under VM Ware Fusion. Each of these image packages is well over 20 GB on their own.Way to go Seagate Awesome Drive.

$review_text.: As a correction to my previous review of 7/12/02, I just discovered that the Sony Clie PEG-N760C does indeed have a &quot;hold&quot; button which locks the keys while the MP3 is playing.  This prevents the MP3 player from stopping if any of the buttons are accidentally depressed; and -- by turning off the display -- it keeps the batteries from draining too quickly.I apologize for this omission in my earlier review.

$REVIEW.: I decided to give this product a try to use with my Garmin 62st, though with trepidation after reading other reviews.  So far, my experience has been different.  I have done a number of downloads and I'll provide data on one which was typical:PC Platform: Dell laptop, Win7, wireless-n connection, Comcast providerTime of test:  9:30AM PDTBirdsEye Download: Seattle downtown & environs, highest detailSize: 3370 images, 42MBTime to download:  5 Min 45 secNeither excellent nor bad in my opinion and this was typical of what I was seeing.  As for the product itself, I can see it being useful at times having an aerial photo overlaid by other map data.  Resolution is not super but good enough for my device.DaveUpdate July 7:  Something has changed with this product.  The quality consistency of BirdsEye Satellite Imagery downloaded through Basecamp has become degraded. I select "Highest" quality and I am clearly not getting that based on the image quality and the size of the downloaded file (I'm comparing against previously downloaded images).  The problem is that the s/w allows you to select an area for imagery download at the highest quality with a maximum download size somewhere in the area of 230MB but it does not download imagery of that quality.  You can select a smaller area and get the highest quality imagery but it is a timeconsuming, trial and error process because it is not consistent.  I don't find the lower quality resolution to be acceptable.  Something has changed - per my original review it did not used to do this.  I am not the only user running into this based on other inputs at Garmin's user forums.  I have lowered my product rating accordingly.

$review_text.: I am in the process of wiring my entire house with this cable, it is a new house and is still under construction. I should be able to give a better review of the cables in a few weeks. I did patch a couple short cables to test out what I bought. So far seems to be working great. I was a little concerned that I would receive cat5e because some areas of the description mention the cat5e not cat6, it is definitely cat6. Very good price and its great that it comes with a crimping tool, not a great crimper by any means but it patched two cables successfully.

$review_text.: Mine came as the kit lens with the 70D (which I'll review separately).  I usually shoot prime, but for only $200 more than the body, it seemed like a no brainer.  My only other zoom is the 24-105mm L, which also came in a kit.  While the 24-105 works on a full frame and has better build quality, it still is a good base for comparison.What stands out is the absolutely silent auto focus and IS. So it can be done...  Auto-focus is just as fast as the USM drive on the L lens and spot-on in accuracy (no adjustment needed on the 70D).  IS works also equally efficient.  I shot with both lenses hand held at 1/4 sec. from 6 feet away and no shake discernible at 100% view.  Good enough.Optically, both lenses show quickly that they are no primes, especially at the long end.  However, the difference in the field is not quite as dramatic and both are absolutely usable for most types of shots (except for when I need edge-to-edge sharpness for landscape).  Center sharpness of the EF-S lens is great, definitely in prime territory, and maybe a tad better than the L lens. Edge and corner sharpness is a little worse than the 24-105mm, which is to be expected given that the latter is for full frame.  But not by much, though neither one will win a prize here.  Blur or bokeh is also very similar, maybe a slight edge for the L lens, and gets an acceptable.  If you shoot crop, there is little reason to pick the 24-105mm over this one.  You get almost the same performance for a lower price.  What the 18-135mm lacks in rugged build quality, it makes up with the wider (and much more usable on crop) range and the better performance for video (especially when coupled with a body that can make use of it).So why only 4 stars?  Well, mine shows some softness in one corner at infinity focus, likely a centering problem.  Not unheard of (even with L lenses) and I might see if Canon can tweak it.  The other negative is the manual focus on STM lenses.  There is no direct mechanical connection (focus ring drives the motor) and it is more difficult to fine tune exact focus (if turned past the sweet spot, going back requires more travel).  But this is not a lens I would use for situations that require extremely precise manual focus...

$review_text.: I haven't tried this unit so this is not really a review but i wanted to give you people a viable alternative
First the Sezme doesn't have wireless so this right away makes it a no-buy for me as my dsl landland line is nowhere near my TV
But here is what I have been using the past 2+ years and it gives me all of what the Sezme does and NO MONTHLY Fees (other than Netflix or any other subscriptions you want


So do a search for the ChannelMaster 7000PAL DVR

This is an over the air DVR that gives you a free program guide and lets you record 2 channels at the same time all in HD quality


It's about $100 more but again, no subscription fees of any kind


Then add yourself a ROKU player for $59 and you have all the video on demand you can ask for


Netflix, Amazon, Hulu plus, Free Crackle, Pandora and much much more

The Channelmaster works flawlessly, no buggy software unlike what I have been reading about the Sezme

And the ROKU is the best thing out there.And you have to ask yourself, since Sezme has begun service they have stopped customer service phone calls, only email now


They use to have cable channels which now they have done away with

So I mean, how long before they go out of business and if they do you are stuck with a DVR that does nothing

The Channel Master will always work, it gets its guide from TV guide and digital station data
 It does'nt need an internet connection, just your antenna
And it doensn't matter if channelmaster goes out of business.My monthy cost? $7.99 for Netflix.Just sayin...

The contrast and brightness are great, and my eyeballs are happy. The stands are a little wobbly, and coupled with my wobbly desk, that was a problem. But a stack of Post-its under the corner solves it, so it's not a big deal. I think a twin-post stand would be a better design, though.

$review_text.: I hate when people spend $30 and try to get amazing sound out of cpu speakers


WAKE UP! I have a $3000 home stereo system and that's cheap by audiophile standards
I love harmon kardon and their engineering
I have compared many similar speakers and these deliver great bass and mids for their price range

You won't find'em anymore in store but these were great

My girlfriend had these on her dell cpu when I moved in and I blasted these for 3 years


Not dead yet

My home stereo amp is HK, as well as my sister's
For those who opt to buy cheaper models with big bass and high treb, fools


Listen to these in various music genres


I listen to way too many types to list- a few - live classic rock, rock, classical, salsa, hip hop, house, blues, no complaints

If you can find a pair, pick em up


But please, don't expect to to throw an old school house party and fill the room

It's a 2.0 system for God's sake

For the price, these can't be beat
And I put these at full bass eq with jungle-drumn bass, and that says a lot


ps- I can also clearly hear the trumpets and congas on live music my friend's band plays & records live
Quality from HK as always
If you need to shop around, look on amazon for Boston Acoustics and new higher end Bose or JBLs also


I hate low end priced Bose as the bass is very lacking compared to these
And I love my mids so don't be fooled
Learn to compare frequency range as well

I have no issues with cell phone or my laptop with wireless modem onboard

Try the new JBL's amazon has (no headphoen jack- but worth the lack of perk) or the new slim tower boston acoustics 

Happy shopping!

$REVIEW.: I bought this item because my wife was having problems with the onboard mouse pad on the docking keyboard  for her Asus Transformer.  I was reluctant at first but I've relied on Logitech in the past and have been impressed.  Without doubt, this mouse is fully functional for the touchpad and in my opinion will bring the touchpad more into the limelight with future generations.  Netbooks look out, the touchpad is coming; with these peripherals coming out there's no real need for a Windows OS on a Netbook anymore.  A little pricey, but well worth the money, seamless installation and works extremely well with the Asus Transformer.

$REVIEW.: My girlfriend and I just purchased a new PND, and thought it would be a good idea to get some kinda of case for it. We considered a few options: (1) use one of the existing cases/pouches we already have, (2) get a small/non-bulky case so we could toss it in a purse/backpack, (3) get a larger case to stuff all the related accessories into a single container.Since we already have a variety of small cases/pouches, we opted for #3: the larger case. We ordered the TT Travel Case thinking that all the parts and pieces would fit nicely in the case.Being the gadget geek that I am, I patiently waited the 9 days it took to get to us; diligently checking my Amazon "Where's my Stuff" page, and following the box via the shipping number.Being that TT recommends this case for the device we ordered (tt330s), I thought it would be more of a 'custom fit'. It's not. It's basically a medium sized (about twice the size of a portable cd player) 'harder-sided' case w/ the TT logo on it.Here's what I really didn't like about the case:1. It's not a custom fit for the TT device2. For as big as it is, there's not enough space for the TT, charger/cable, and mount -- let alone the manuals and stuff.3. The case is too large to conveniently 'take with you' when you park the car.For the price (~$30) I'd recommend (1) re-purposing a pouch/bag you already have; or (2) wait til you have your PND and all the accessories you want to pack in front of you, and then go get a generic case/pouch/bag from Target or Walmart ;)

$REVIEW.: Compared to a surface pro, this is an awesome value

You get the same OS, a bigger screen, an included keyboard/cover & it works great.Pros: Very inexpensive, light, fast boot, reasonably fast for everything else, comes with Office


As a tablet OS Windows 8 is great


I've only had  it a few days but the battery life seems OK.Cons: Not a very rugged plastic frame that is glass smooth, makes you a slightly nervous about handling it (dropping it), but that goes away when it is plugged into the keyboard


Windows 8 is not very backwardly compatible & kinda sucks for desktop apps, I may have to switch to W7 if I want to use some of my expensive older software (would cost a lot more to upgrade software then to downgrade windows)


I don't think the touchscreen has an oleophobic coating, it gets a lot of fingerprints on it, but you only really notice that when it is off.

$review_text.: I've just received this product, so this is a preliminary review. I purchased it because it generates a true sine wave output. My computer's power supply won't tolerate anything less. I've used probably 7 or 8 APC products over the years, and they've been very reliable. As the earlier reviewer said, this is a redesign of the SUA1000, and it's only been sold for the past few months. The only issue I have with the product so far is that the fan is constantly running -- even when no load is present. And, as the other reviewer noted, the fan is fairly loud. I've written to APC Technical Support because the constant running of the fan doesn't seem to be normal behavior. The fan runs constantly for about 5 minutes, then stops for a few seconds, and then resumes again. This occurs with a fully charged backup battery, running on AC, with no load plugged in and at normal room temperature. The only time I can get the fan to turn off is after I run a self-test. But after about 10 or 15 minutes, the fan begins to run constantly again with those very brief pauses. I'll have to see what the support people say.2/15/2010 UPDATE TO REVIEW:APC Technical Support informs me that the fan behavior I described above is completely normal. If you purchase this product, be prepared for a very loud fan that constantly cycles on and off (five minutes on and five seconds off) even with no load plugged in. When I asked whether it made more sense to have the fan run continuously without the brief pauses to minimize cycling of the fan motor, I didn't receive a response. I have no idea what purpose the brief pauses in the fan operation serve except to remind me how much I miss a quiet UPS. I was told that it would be possible for APC to release a firmware update to modify the fan parameters if enough people complained about the noise, but no firmware update is currently planned so I wouldn't count on it.8/1/2011 UPDATE:APC released a firmware update (see comments) that modified the fan behavior so it only operates when the unit is supplying battery backup to a load. The fan no longer runs while the load is being supplied by the AC mains. I've revised the review to five stars.

$REVIEW.: Here is why I bought this Roku player:1. Amazon Prime made a fair amount of content available that I like.2. Watching it on my computer is OK and I do have an HDMI output but it is an inelegant solution to the problem of quality viewing.3. The Roku XD box is HD capable and Wireless.4. The price is lower than other similar wireless IP based players.This is what delighted me part 1, the free content:I watched everything in the documentary catagory in the Amazon freebie channel and began to watch Brit Coms like "A bit of Fry and Laurie".I then found the "Red Dwarf" shows and watched a few of them.Then I discovered the other channels such as CDN2 and TwiT.Wow! I can watch recent lecture videos from Yale and Stanford. No, I am not joking I love this stuff.I get to see Leo pontificate about the future every week on TwiT.If you understood what I was going on about here you will know why I am so happy with the Roku.This is what delighted me part 2, the device:This is a teeny tiny little box. No hidden switches or battery back-up. Just plug in power, plug in the HDMI and that is all.Set up was intuitive. I needed no manual and that was good because there was no manual in the box.I was connected and watching content within 15 minutes of opening the box.The remote is very cool. Simple, compact and easy. A track ball or scroll wheel would make it better but it works just fine as is.The streaming is flawless.Start up is quick.The HD is very good and the SD is as good as SD gets.I experimented and unplugged the WiFi router while I was watching a program. The router was off for 30 seconds and the film played on without any hint that there was a connection error.This is the first device of its type that I purchased so I have nothing to compare it to but I also have no complaints and I am very pleased with the new source of content that I enjoy (for free!) on my TV.I do like this technology and just hope no one messes with the free channels I like. If they start charging for CDN2 (for example) I would be far less likely to use the thing.

 For those wondering if thay are better than most of the supplied earphones or the bargain brands that one might find at chain stores, or even drugstores, the answer is YES.First of all the earphones have 3 ear buds, so you can beassured of a good fit


 The sound is amazing, compared to cheaper products


 Though it does have a handy case, the build is substantial and solid


I can be rough on headphones,and there have been no problems.I like the notion that the right side ear bud is RED, too.I would imagine that even if you used this on a older player, or computer, you would find that your experience is greatly enhanced- things sound better.This might well make an excellent gift, for those who are a bit hard to buy for - for some, this might not be a luxury they would buy for themselves -- why not delight someone?  This is really a nice item, I think.

$review_text.: I'll make this brief,I'm not a fan of these speakers because:1)They look and feel cheap. The metal looking frame around each speaker is actually plastic. Each speaker weighs approximately 8 ounces. This sucks because if you so much as graze the cord the speaker moves since there's no weight to it.2) The biggest reason I'm not a fan of these is that there is no control for the subwoofer. Absolutely no way to reduce the bass.  The only controls on these speakers are the two knobs on the left speaker; volume & tone.  Tone does next to nothing.  I'd love to unplug the subwoofer and just use the two speakers. They sound pretty good by themselves, but they are powered through the overbearing subwoofer so you cannot run them alone.There are better speakers available out there in this price range.

$REVIEW.: I've had this unit for close to 2 years. I wear it on a lanyard around my neck & use it constantly during the work day for taking notes.I work outdoors in a trade and have found the unit to be very reliable, even in moist environments (i.e. rainy weather, or inside my sweaty clothing,) though it does not have any specific water-resistant features or ratings.Menus & features are average and generally well thought out. MicroSD expansion card handy for recording lots of audio. Battery life good: works fine with NiMH rechargeables, though their slightly lower voltage means the battery life indicator displays a max. of 3 out of 4 bars, never full. Sound quality pretty good, speaker is adequately loud. Rec & Play buttons have different shapes so you can tell which is which without looking at the unit.Cons:With heavy use, the silk-screened legends on the buttons wear off. Use a small engraving tool to carve them permanently into the plastic, to avoid confusion.Also, with heavy use, on a thin, strong nylon cord strung around my neck, after about 6 months the plastic corner-hole / bracket through which the loop passes gave out. (It wore through.) I used a 2-part epoxy ("Plasteel") to carefully build up an excess on the corner. Just before the "Plasteel" epoxy set permanently, I stuck the end of a paper clip through it to create a hole for the lanyard. The reinforcement has held up great since then.When using w/ a MicroSD card, the unit seems to take a long time (>6 to 8 seconds) to power up. It is "Accessing...." and until it finishes the startup process, you cannot record. But, as the unit has configurable 60-second to 60-minute "hot standby" function available (i.e. when it is ready for instant-on recording,) the power-up delay can be tolerated.No backlight.---- Update 2014-01-10 ----After 2 years of regular hard use, hanging around my neck both inside & outside my shirt while doing heavy landscaping, gardening, and carpentry (even in damp & rainy weather,)  the unit has started to fail. It records OK but now playback has become unreliable, cutting in and out. I opened it up to see if there were any loose connections inside, none are visible. Considering that this unit is not *at all* weatherized or ruggedized, I think it's done quite well with the harsh conditions I used it in.I will be replacing it soon with another similar model.
$review_summary.: Durable, functional


Needs stronger lanyard bracket.

$review_text.: I agree with other reviewers that the volume control is tricky. But it does indeed work; you just have to understand how to control the volume, which is not at all intuitive.  It seems to be some sort of touch feel, so no there is no feedback whether or not you are successfully changing the volume - well, of course, other than the sound getting louder or softer :-)If you press too hard, which is tempting thing to do, then it doesn't seem to work. So try pressing gently.If your computer has its own volume control, then you will likely find it preferable to just use its controls instead.I regularly use these speakers both with a MacBook Pro and with a Samsung HDTV monitor (I move the speaker cord back and forth between the TV/monitor and the computer), so I primarily rely on the volume control of the MacBook and TV.The sound quality on these speakers is good. My only complaint is the number of wires, but this will be the case on any set of computer speakers.  It's just ridiculous how many wires there are, and Mac users will be more sensitive to this than PC users (PC users are used to a gazillion wires; Mac users like me are spoiled).There are FOUR bulky cables coming out of the subwolfer:  one to each speaker, one to the audio source, and one for the power. Again, this is not a ding against this model specifically, as they are all this way.  This is a ding against the industry for not consolidating these ugly cables via some innovation (think HDMI).If you can live with wires everywhere :-) then I recommend these speakers.  If you don't want the wires, then get a device with good integrated speakers (like an iMac).

$REVIEW.: This part has nothing to do with the camera - just a short personal note.  For the past few years I have bought a new Canon high-end point & shoot (Like the SX30 or SX40) every year. Amazon normally has a decent discount around Thanksgiving. I keep all the original packaging & accessories from my old camera, take some really nice pics & can usually sell it on eBay around Christmas for about 15% less than I paid for it.  That way I can stay with the latest model and amortize the replacement cost of a new camera over about 5 - 6 years which I figure is about the life of the camera anyway.Now onto the camera ...........If you have an SX30 or earlier model, TRADE UP!  Three main reasons I'm sold on this model are:1) CMOS sensor - Although Canon downgraded this new model to 12 mp from 14mp on the SX30, the reduced noise on the SX40 is very evident if you do any extreme crops.2) Burst mode - In the last couple years we did an Alaska cruise and went to Sea World in San Diego.  I got a few nice shots of whales & porposes jumping - by dumb luck.  I had to try and judge when to shoot.  Tons of missed shots.  Wish I had the burst mode for these shooting conditions.3) Tracking face detection works great!I have not taken any night photos in years so the low light limitations a few people mentioned are not an issue with me.I have thought many times about upgrading to a DSLR to get some additional features.  I've always decided not to as I've found over the years (I'm retirement age) that I hated lugging multiple lenses, etc.  The addition of the CMOS sensor and burst mode has brought this camera very close, in my humble opinion, to a DSLR.  Plus the 35X optical zoom.  It would be hard to part with these features in this compact package & go to a DSLR.  I have to admit that I may look at the Sony Alpha Nex-7 when it hits the market - a compact DSLR with interchangeable lenses & 24mp.  Yum!  $1200 for the body & $800 for an 18-200mm zoom?  Well, on second thought ...............On March 28, 2012 I'll be adding a photo of a raptor (Cooper's hawk?) that I took from what I would guess would be around 200-300 feet & hand held.  I think the detail in the image is incredible for a camera under $400.

The sound is crisper & clearer than, and detail is good and above the average..


for workout.The headphones come with a solid long cable w/ a clip, with a small "L" shaped plug, with 3 sets of differently sized rubber, and 1 set of foam covers, and with a bag

The right size rubber covers fit well, but do not fully seal for the weak bass

The foam ones do, but also expose overpowering mids & highs..


expected at this price point


If used with the Philips GoGEAR players, the equalizer settings balance mids & highs w/ the bass, and the FullSound technology (software) enhances the sound quality of the MP3-compressed music.

$REVIEW.: Recently purchased several of these newer models to supplement the older versions we have been using for a couple years now with great results. Very easy to use & set up and picture & video quality is remarkable. Time lapse shooting at various intervals from 10 seconds to 1 day, there is a setting for any purpose. I typically use the 10 second interval for projects taking 8 hours or less. Sometimes we set up more than one camera on a job to capture different perspectives. For example during a demolition & reconstruction project that may take 5 months, we have one camera set on 10 or 30 seconds to detail the demolition process and another one set on a longer interval to capture the entire project from demo to completion. We use iMovie & iPhoto on a Mac to edit and make movies from our stills. A great investment!

$REVIEW.: Let me tell you, straight out, this family is a digital family

 We've had digital cameras for years now and we've had quite an assortment


 Everyone, in our family, has one.My personal favorite, is the digital rebel


 I know you're asking, why is she reviewing this camera then?  Easy!  I wanted a camera that I could easily whip out and capture a shot with..


but I didn't want the tiny handheld ones
 I wanted something that felt comfortable, in my hand...
yet.

wasn't heavy
 I was also looking for zoom.This camera fits that bill, perfectly! and at a great price too!To start, this camera runs on 4 AA batteries
 Usually, that's a turn off for me, but I picked up some 2300 mhz batteries and I can easily get 500+ shots out of a charge of those, w/ the LCD and the flash on
 With the batteries, this baby weights, about a pound


 While that may seem heavy, compared to the little tiny cameras and cell phones that are avialable these days.


Let me tell you

 That's not heavy
 It's got a great neck strap and the camera carrys comfortably on that, around your neck,  w/out weighing you down.The 10x zoom is real nice!  Now, I'm only using optical zoom, otherwise, with the digital kicked in, it would be a 30x

 I just rely on the optical

 This camera takes some VERY nice pictures with that zoom


 A picture worthy of the Canon name!  And you can capture such a nice picture because of the IS (image stabilization) that is built into this camera
 You will notice little (or no) camera shake when you have it fully zoomed in on something


 Admittedly, it seemed like it, with the first couple test shots I took
 I was looking through the viewfinder, aiming at something down the street.
and it seemed like I was waivering all over the place
 But when I downloaded the pictures


 I was VERY pleased

 Crystal clear!I have the found, that some cameras have terrible color saturation, w/ the picture right out of the camera


 This isn't one of them


 With the default settings, the blues (sky, water) are rich, tonal, and dimentional


 There's no red problems, when shooting reds, that I've noticed


 Sometimes reds will bleed out .

or not appear true.


and that's simply not the case.Indoor pictures.

I'll be honest.


W/ the built in flash, this little camera, kicks my $1K camera's behind!  The flash doesn't tend to wash out the subject (on the default settings).
skin tones are exactly what they are


 Little or no adjustments are needed, in my book.This camera is fast to start up, and write, to the CF card that it uses (buy a bigger CF card!)


 It's got auto controls for those that don't want to think

 For those that want to learn a bit more about photography, it's got the F stops, and all that jazz..ALONG WITH...the ability to change your focal point


 You're not stuck in the middle of the frame


 If you want your subject off to the left of the frame..and the rest to be 'soft'..
That's not a problem

 With a simple push of the button, your point of focus changes.I can go on.

but I'm sure you have the idea, after reading all these reviews.This is a great camera for the money


 While you maybe taking a step down, in megapixels, you're gaining the zoom ability

 The decrease in the megapixels, I feel, are not that noticible.In fact, this camera has all the features that I was looking for, in my higher end cameras
.
but for a fraction of the price.i wouldn't think twice about recommending this camera to anyone


 It's a great camera.

Viewing angle is excellent, and the automatic brightness adjustment works well.This unit does a good job on handling standard (480i) inputs.  The stretch mode will adjust a 480i picture to the size of the screen, maintaining the 4:3 ratio (i.e. black bars on the sides).  The zoom mode is appropriate for letter-boxed DVDs and movies, and enlarges the letterbox to fill the screen, again maintaining the original aspect ratio.  There are some additional stretching modes, including a "smart stretch" mode that pulls out the sides of a 4:3 image to fill the 16:9 screen without distorting the center of the image.  Works fairly well, but generally with a 480i picture I'll either use sidebar or zoom, depending on whether or not the image is letterboxed.For higher quality inputs, the available stretching modes are dynamically adjusted to a set appropriate for the input.  Generally they do the reasonable thing.I've got anOnkyo TX-SR607to handle the audio, so I have no comments there.  One minor annoyance is that TV displays "No appropriate audio signal found" whenever the input or picture mode is changed, unless you've turned the sound on the TV to zero.The HDMI control on the receiver has a few warts.  While turning off the TV will turn off the receiver, turning the TV on does not turn on the receiver.  However, changing TV inputs to another source and back to the receiver does turn the receiver on.  Seems like a firmware bug, but the latest update didn't fix it.
$SUMMARY.: Great picture

$REVIEW.: Please read carefully when buying from this merchant. What you are getting may bear little resemblance to what you see.The illustration for this product clearly shows a fan of ethernet cables in rainbow colors, a typical and desirable scheme that makes it easy to trace wires when later troubleshooting comm. problems. That's not what you're buying, however, as they embedded the word, "black" in the 13-word item name, something I, at least, failed to notice when ordering late at night.  You're about to get 10 identically black cables. With an item this cheap, it's not worth the cost of return in time and money, so I was faced with the choice of spending the next decade trying to isolate dark, identical, bundled wires or tossing them out and going down to Fry's and buying what I wanted.  I chose the latter.When searching for the item again on Amazon to write this review, I see that this merchant uses this same color-fan illustration everywhere, even where they are just selling a single cable, not even a bunch. Sloppy!In other news, the order was delivered promptly.

However it never really seemed to cool the laptop, it always seemed the battery area got real hot and that concerned me
I purchased stick on legs for the computer and using those to help prop up the laptop allowed the air to flow underneath it and has kept it cool.Would still recommend this item just would suggest you add the legs to your laptop/notebook to allow the air to flow.

My wife is thrilled.I only wish the set up applicaiton was a little better.  It's a web app, which makes it a little clunky.  I also think some of the questions can be out of context or not offer an option that I'm looking for.

$review_text.: Originally 2 stars (changed it later)So the screen protector is matte and anti-glare.  I followed the instructions, and even watched the installation video, but even still, I had bubbles after multiple attempts ( I see why that at least 3 is necessary).  In the end, I gave up because I didn't want to leave the screen unprotected.I can actually live with the bubble because on my last attempt the bubble was minor and there was just one on the top corner.  However, there is a major minus to the protector.  I know that this isn't the HD version, but it really makes the screen blurry.  It looks like there are multi-colored pixel dots on the screen.  A friend picked up my phone and said, "What is wrong with this screen?  I thought the iPhone 5 was suppose to have a good screen".  But it really wasn't the screen but the screen protector.On the other hand, the protector is definitely anti-glare and anti-fingerprint.  Just extremely bad when there is a light background on the screen (really really bad).  It kind of defeats the purpose of having an iPhone 5 with great display.I would only buy this if you only care about fingerprints and not how it looks on the phone.  However, I think the price is pretty good hence its not one star.***Update October 8th, 2013 (upgraded from 2 star to 4 star)So after about a month, I got used to the multi-color pixels, and pretty much learned to ignore it.  A year later when I wanted to replace my screen protector (it had a lot of scratches) I ordered another one (accidently from the same brand...lol) and it was fine.  You just have to get used to it  (yet I do think the quality may have improved in the one year difference, it still has the multi-colored tiny dots, but not as blurry).  The new pack I got came with four dust stickers....omg that made things so much easier.  Installation was much smoother this time around.Over the year, I think I did like the matte finish and anti-finger print nature of it.  For the price, this is probably the best you can get in this category.  I have seen matte screens that look wonderful (its just too bad that I forgot to get the name of the company that made it), but this is fine for 5 dollars.Also, I would actually make this a 4.5 star (only because I don't give 5 stars unless its a pretty much a perfect product) because of the seller.  They actually contacted me about sending me a clear HD version of the screen after my 2 star review.  That was really nice of them, even though I never responded because I didn't see that message until now.  So I at least can say that this seller tries to make sure that their customer is happy which isn't always the case for everything on Amazon.

$REVIEW.: The price on this laptop can fluctuate a lot. Have seen it for as little as 900-950. This is not an inexpensive machine by any standard but you do get a heck of a lot of features and functionality. I bought this for my daughter who will be going to college soon and needs a powerful machine to get her through the next 4 years.What I like about the TX2:Good build quality as far as I can tell until nowSwivel screen - turn it sideways, turn it all the way around or turn the whole thing into a tablet computerFingerprint reader - does not work every time but often enough and makes logging on much simplerPlenty of memory - 4GB ram, 320 GB hard drive (some configurations have larger hard drives)Works 3 ways - keyboard & touchpad, stylus and fingerGood speakersNifty remote controlPlenty of ports8 cell battery gives nice amount of work time when away from a power source (extra purchase, not included)What I don't like:Screen needs some getting used to. Has a weird look to it as its touch/stylus sensitive. Some call it grainy, I would say its like there is an extra layer of not quite transparent glass on top of the display. Could be a deal breaker for some.Kind of heavy and a little bulky for the sizeFan seems to run all the time, occasionally reminding me of a travel hair dryerA HDMI and/or eSata port would have been niceAll in all this device is something I would have expected Apple to come up with first. Slick, innovative and packs a punch - especially for the price. Something like this from Apple would probably cost at least $500 more. Touch works quite well not only with the HP Touchsmart user interface, but with Vista in general -  unless you have really big fingers.UPDATE 5/7/09There seems to be an ongoing issue with the screen. Seems that HP has some tx2's out with a glossy screen and some with the matte /sparkly effect that I have on mine. Shoppers have mentioned that Best Buy will have the glossy type on display yet it seems HP is now only shipping the matte/sparkly kind.

$review_text.: This is a very worthwhile peripheral to keep around. We recently had an old desktop with 2 hard drives die due to blown capacitors on the motherboard, and although I had backed up my own data well, not all members of my family had planned ahead so well. This device let us access our files on the hard drives and transfer them to the newer computer(s). We can also use the old hard drives for backup as well ... in particular, home video takes a ton of space, so it's a decent way to archive things like that.From a security perspective, holding on to your old hard drives (or at least being able to overwrite them with zeros for security before re-using them for non-sensitive info like home video & pictures) is a lot wiser than just throwing it in the trash or recycling it as is.It's great that it works for both 3.5 and 2.5 inch drives (haven't tested the latter), and is backward compatible to USB 2.0 (which I have verified).I have two minor quibbles. One, the drive tends to go to sleep after a not very long period of inactivity. It comes back quickly enough, though. Two, and this is probably more the fault of the OS on the recovered hard drives(WinXP SP3), when I was trying to recover files from other users, I was denied access repeatedly even though I had been the sole administrator, and no one's user login required a password. I had to manually re-assign &#34;ownership&#34; of the directories and subdirectories to get at the files and recover them. This got to be tedious - but it's not likely the fault of this product. It's just something you may have to deal with when using this product.I probably won't leave it lying around plugged in, but it sure is a nice &#34;insurance policy&#34; to have if your computer dies but your hard drive is OK.

Unfortunately, this card is no faster (I timed it with a stopwatch) than the basic 256MB Olympus Card (the one with no designation).  I was really looking forward to it being faster and the "M" card is now $35.99, which would have worked the same.  I feel like I paid extra for nothing, but 300 pix for $46 ain't bad, so 4 stars.Check the Olympus site here: [...] to make sure your camera can use this particular size and type of xD card.

For people who can't afford a new computer, this is a great option. Just remember that this is a FULL build. It's not an upgrade version. ALL DATA WILL BE LOST, so backup and save anything you want to keep before installing. You will need grandpa glasses to read the KEY.

$REVIEW.: The more devices that I purchase; the greater my need for a solution like this. The Bolse SuperSpeed 7 Port USB 3.0 HUB has a very sleek looking design, and is very easy to set up.I'm always in the need for extra USB ports, and this little device fits the bill perfectly. It enables you to take a single USB port and convert it into a 7 port hub. The top right section contains 2 ports for charging, while the remaining 5 ports are in the front. The top mounted ports enable you to plug in devices that might need a little extra room. When each port is in use; a light will display, indicating that the port is in use and functioning correctly.Prior to my using this item; I had all sorts of wires hanging out the back of my computer. They were rigged up to several daisy-chained USB hub's, making my work area look like a power station. I've tested the Bolse hub with several different devices, and it works perfectly with all. Ironically; the only thing that bothers me is the power supply plug. It's on the large side, which means that if you have several other items plugged into a surge protector; it may not fit. In my case; I didn't have this problem, as I own a surge protector that enables you to separate all of the various outlets. Just be aware that this might be an issue if you're using a conventional surge protector.The bottom line is that this hub is well designed, very sleek looking with its shiny black exterior, and functions perfectly. It's definitely a 5 star product.

$REVIEW.: I find this keyboard to be of excellent quality, highly customizable, with great key action, but a bit pricy.Design Features:The keyboard is laid out with 12 function keys on the left side (with three memory positions, thus having 36 possible macros for each profile). Along the top (above the keys), from left to right one finds the three memory buttons, a button to invoke memory recording, a slide switch to lock out the WIN key, a set of cursor and menus to control the color display that is in the center, a backlight on/off button, the scroll/caps/num lock indicators, and some media control buttons for playing music. Directly below the media buttons is a mute key and a wide scroll wheel for volume control. The rest of the keyboard is more or less standard, except that the arrow keys are a lighter color. as are the gaming A,S,D, W keys.Use:The keys have an interesting feel to them; I think they may be some kind of special coating. Typing is very good, with a nice action (although I'm not sure anyone would pay this much for a typing keyboard). For gaming, the macro keys can be programmed to any of several different functions via the gaming software (I list the functions below). I was startled to find that the keyboard has a heavy cord, which plugs into both the computer AND a power brick. That is the first time I've seen an additional power requirement on a keyboard. Overall, this is a very good keyboard for those games where it can provide the edge.Good:+ The design looks and feels great, with a good quality key action action. I expect it to be very durable.+ Controls for volume (a roll bar), mute, and standard audio controls.+ The keyboard is a bit heavy (not a disadvantage in gaming), but it is actually a very compact size, especially compared to my G15.+ The color LCD features an adjustable angle and can be set to any of several applets such as performance, profile selector, etc. There are also some less than useful ones like view the camera and videos/pictures (on a 2 inch screen).+ The button to lock out the Windows key is very useful when you are using a controller, or just to make sure you don't accidentally hit it during a game.+ The keyboard works with the excellent Logitech gaming software - one can configure macro keys to do useful functions: keystroke, multikey (enter multiple keystrokes), text block (to enter a block of text into the document), mouse functions, play media, Windows hotkeys, shortcut to a program, basic Windows programs (calculator, media player, web browser, my computer, m1, m2,m3), or control a logitech headset.+ There are 263 pre-configered game profiles; the software will search for these games on your computer and automatically configure them.+ The keyboard worked fine on Windows 8.+ The software has a function to copy profiles between PCs by transferring them to the keyboard. Very useful.Less Good:- I could not get my windows 7 computer to recognize the keyboard, and therefore the gaming software did not work either. I have some kind of issue with my particular computer - it didn't recognize my gaming mouse either - and since it worked in Windows 8, I did not deduct any stars.- The touch typing bumps on F and J keys are very small, which makes touch typing difficult.- Requires power brick. I suppose the backlight and color LCD take up some power, but having a second brick is a bit inconvenient.Summary: Well built, slick looking, and with excellent control software. If you can afford it and want to take your gaming to the next level, this is the keyboard to buy. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: For those times when I wouldn't carry my iPad, I didn't want to carry a larger purse all the time.  Therefore, I was looking for a way to carry it without having to carry a larger purse.I found this neoprene sleeve which makes it easy to clean.  It also has foam for extra protection.  I know it says it is for a laptop/Chromebook/MacBook Air but even though it just slightly larger than needed for my iPad, it works perfectly.  I added a strap that is used for hanging badges around your neck and it makes it easy to carry.With the added room, I can add my wallet, clip my keys to the outside and I'm all set for those quick trips when that is all I need.  When I travel, it can still go in the sleeve and be slipped into my computer backpack and be twice as protected.  We all know how much bumping around happens in an airport and on a plane.If you are looking for a slim, easy to clean sleeve for any of the products mentioned in the title, you can add iPad to the list and be sure to have a dependable item.

$review_text.: Let me tell you about my Asus laptop / Amazon experience.  I found this laptop at a great price on Amazon and decided to order it.  It arrived quickly even using super-saver (free) shipping, however once I opened it I realized it had been damaged during shipping.  I turned it on and it worked great, but the case was dented/damaged so I decided to send it back.  I was already anticipating having to fight with Amazon when I contacted them using the chat feature and &#8216;spoke&#8217; with Richard to see what could be done.Amazon, listen up &#8211; Richard is the single most important reason I will be recommending Amazon to my friends and family.Richard took the time to listen to my story and assisted me in exchanging my defective laptop and getting the replacement . . . actually, I had to return the defective one to get a refund then repurchase the replacement but to my pleasant surprise Richard made it just about painless.  Richard sent me a link to print out the prepaid shipping label and expedited my order so I was only without my laptop for 1 day.  It&#8217;s service like this that keeps me coming back . . . I&#8217;ll definitely recommend Amazon.  It&#8217;s this kind of action we need in the White House!  ;-)Anyway, about the laptop &#8211; you&#8217;re probably not going to find a better deal on a Windows 8 laptop with a touch screen feature anywhere else (Best Buy sometimes has it on sale).  The Q200E-BSI3T08 has a quick 1.8 GHz Intel Core i3-3217U processor (3rd generation), 4 GB of DDR3 memory, a 500 GB hard drive, a 1.0 MP webcam, a USB 3.0 port, wireless LAN (802.11n) and a built-in 10/100/1000 (Gigabit) network card.  Please note &#8211; the screen is an 11.6&#8221; WXGA display and there is NO optical drive (no CD/DVD drive) so you&#8217;ll need to use an external CD/DVD drive.  Also, the 4 GB of ram is soldered in so you can't expand it and the battery is not removable (you&#8217;ll have to take the laptop apart to change the battery).First thing I did was to follow JDHodges.com Asus Q200E hard drive upgrade website (you can Google it) and replaced the 500 GB hard drive with a Samsung 840 Pro solid state drive (SSD).  The SSD made a big difference in performance and battery consumption and my Asus now boots up and is ready to go in about 8 seconds.  I didn&#8217;t have a copy of Windows 8 for a clean install so I used the Samsung Data Migration software to bring everything over from the original hard drive.  The Samsung Magician software also makes it easy to optimize/tune my new SSD and monitor drive health.  Both software titles are included with the SSD or it can be downloaded from the Samsung website for free.  FYI - it will only work with Samsung SSD drives (it checks).Next I swapped out the wireless card for the Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino Wi-Fi card.  This card is dual band (Advanced-N) and includes Bluetooth.  It ran about $22 from Amazon with free shipping.  You&#8217;ll need another antenna for the dual band so I also ordered a pair of laptop wireless mini-PCI-E internal antennas (ASIN: B004ZHT2JE) from Amazon for about $10 including shipping.Now I have a touch-screen Windows 8 laptop that rocks!  It&#8217;s super light (about 3 pounds), boots in less than 10 seconds, has a decent processor with a solid state hard drive (no worries about bumps) with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and is only 0.9&#8221; thin!  Because of the new SSD hard drive efficiency &#8211; battery consumption has improved, but you&#8217;ll probably get between 3.5 to 4 hours of use depending on your usage.  I loaded Microsoft Office 2013 (Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint, Outlook) and Visual Studio and they work great - no issues so far.I've only had this laptop for a about a month so I'll update my review in a few months if things change.
$SUMMARY.: This thing rocks!

$REVIEW.: I was surprised at the quality of the filter set I received.  Although they are made of plastic, if you handle them carefully and put them back in their cases properly, they should give you years of great performance.  It took a while to get used to the filter holder and lens mount, but they are reasonably easy to work with. I like the fact that there are adapters that will work with all of my lenses.  I like the selection of filters and will probably will use them mostly on landscapes when I'll have the time to set them up.

$review_text.: I have a photo shoot of a friend coming up, in Wilmington, and wanted to have an umbrella step up for some portraits.  While I am very comfortable using my SB600 flash mounted to the Nikon D90 for portraits I have been interested in getting into more off camera flash photography, especially with regard to portraiture.I purchased this set up based a great deal on it's cost effectiveness and decent reviews.  The old adage that you get what you pay for is always in my mind.  I came into this with realistic expectations due to the price I was paying, and from comments made by other reviewers here on Amazon.The package arrive as scheduled and was boxed well.  All items were in great condition/no damage.  After opening the boxes we performed a pre-inspection of the products.  First impressions:  no suprises here.  The light stand is a bit flimsy, but I believe it will do it's job if treated with care.  The lightstand hot shoe head has a dissapointing umbrella mount.  The socket which holds the umbrella is very loose due to poor engineering.  This can be rigged/repaired easily with items around your home.The umbrellas are of a cheap quality, but again I figured as much from the price they were offering the product for.  The white umbrella is the better of the three.  Both the gold and silver umbrellas with black non-removable backing are a bit see-through when held to the window or other light source.  This being said, they both still reflect quite a bit of light and they will certainly serve their purpose of working me into more off-camera portraiture.Along with this lightstand I also ordered the Yongnuo wireless transmitter-reciever set to trigger my flash off-camera.  The D90 and SB600 are capable of wireless commander mode, but I hate using the pop up flash as it depleats my camera batteries that much faster.  I also ordered a seperate Monfrotto head for the light stand so that the new wireless triggers could be mounted properly.In closing, if you are on a tight budget or just starting to delve into strobist photography this will most likely fit your needs.  If you preface your purchase with realistic expectations you will be less likely to find dissapointment.  I look forward to giving the stand and umbrellas a full work out in the next few days and will update the review once this has been done.

$review_text.: I am ok with the case for carrying the GPS. However, the car charger with the Lifetime Traffic is too bulky to fit easily into the case. I may use this case with the Tomtom Start 55 With Lifetime Maps and Traffic and Roadside Assistance, but without the cord. A small notebook and pen/pencil will sit nicely in the mesh pouch inside the top cover. As soon as I opened it I decided to buy another larger case to hold all my cords and GPS together. It is nice to be able to separate the items so one does not damage the other and even though this case does not hold everything, it will protect the GPS and that is what I wanted. I do not mind buying a hard case of a different brand and style to hold everything including the extra cords and dash mount.AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for 5-Inch GPS -Black

For those of you who care about max speed, i get 83mbps with 5g in the same room (on a 100mbps connection)


A room away i get about 60-70 on the 5g


So this is pretty amazing
I live in a small college apartment so can't really shed light on the range etc
5G does get worse if you are more than a room away however, and then it is more effective to us the 2.4G band


I would suggest making it N only and 40mhz as this adds speed to the connection

Despite adjusting the iPod EQ to many settings, I couldn't get rid of the tinny sound.

$review_text.: Magellan uses a program called "Magellan Content Manager" to update software and maps


I have used it for my Magellan 1475Ts.Content Manager could not "register" my 3120


I contacted support and got a canned reply, is it plugged in? Is your computer turned on? etc, etc


I said yes, yes, yes, please escalate.Couple days later I got mail from a real person

He was knowledgeable, didn't treat me like an idiot, and he stuck with me to resolve all my issues.He suggested I change the name of the 3120 in content manager

So instead of the default "Magellan Roadmate 3120" I changed it just "3120"


The registration was successful! Go figure.But then when I tried to download the software update, Content Manager failed, put up a lot of screwy messages, and bricked my GPS.The guy at Magellan quickly explained how to unbrick my GPS (there are plenty of instructions how to do this on the Internet).I asked him, how can I download updates in the future without bricking my GPS, and he acknowledged the problems in Content Manager and said they would most likely be resolved by the time another firmware update comes out and you know what, I believe they will.It's not good that there were problems updating the GPS, definitely not good that the software bricked my GPS, but when a problem occurred Magellan support was responsive, respectful and effective
That to me makes all the difference and gives me confidence in the device.The main reason I bought this GPS is because it does not have Traffic

My 1475T GPSs have ad-based traffic


In the years I have owned them, there has never been a single traffic incident reported

But I do get ads

I get ads even when I turn traffic completely off


So I bought the 3120 in order not to have to look at ads in exchange for a traffic feature that doesn't work.

The installation was a bit irritating, as it needed to install more things than it should have, it took a really long time, and it required me to reboot my computer several times.After that, though, pretty useful. The software allows you to open multiple PDFs, drag and drop certain pages amongst them, and then recombine them. There might be some more advanced features that I haven't figured out yet (probably), but this was pretty much the purpose that I wanted it for, so...

 If you can't afford the big FL-50 flash by Olympus (between $350 and $450 in stores), then this Vivitar 383 will do quite well.



$review_summary.: Not a match for the Olympus FL-50 - but it does a superb job anyway

$REVIEW.: After ordering this docking station, I found that I cannot use it for my setup.  First of all, it will only accept a DVI video connector, which I do not have for my monitor.  Secondly, I share my keyboard, monitor and mouse between two different computers, using theStarTech 2 Port Professional USB KVM Switch Kit with Cables (SV231USB)to switch between them.  One computer is a laptop and the other is my main desktop.  I thought it might, but this docking station will not work with this configuration because the laptop must be connected to the docking station for it to use the monitor, keyboard and mouse.If you want a cheaper solution, you could instead buy a KVM switch similar to the StarTech and just connect the peripherals to that.  Then when you want to use the laptop with the periperals, simply plug in the KVM's USB plug to the laptop and you're good to go.  And with this solution, you also get the ability to connect another laptop or desktop to the same peripherals!  Voila.
$SUMMARY.: Cannot use this docking station

$review_text.: First and foremost, this is a truly great GPS.  Second, you MUST upgrade the firmware to the current level -- makes it perform at peak level.  (Also, if you're a AAA member, upgrade the AAA Tourbook data and get your free, members only warranty extension -- see [...]).  Third, make your own assessment, don't put too much faith in the negative reviews -- I frankly question the honesty in some of them.I've only had my 4250 for a few days, but both my wife and I agree that it's an incredible device. Read the previous review by BrandonNM, "Jeff" and see that I agree completely with his comments.  But also notice that many of the cons are being addressed by Magellan with the new 4350 and 4370 to be released in July 08.  I read many, many reviews and user comments in trying to decide whether to buy the Maestro 4250, wait for the new one or go with the Garmin 760.  I'm glad I chose the 4250 and can happily wait a couple of years to get a newer Magellan replacement.If you have or buy the 4250, be sure to tap on every icon and every info box to see what it will display.  The manual is definitely too brief (that's a minor negative) and doesn't show all the options (and that's a major plus -- there's more here than meets the eye).  An example, tap on the "Arrival time" box when you're in a route, it changes to remaining time and remaining miles before going back to arrival time.  It seems everything has buried options underneath.I read many reviews and user comments.  Some are clearly biased, others I wonder how they got a unit that was bad.  Mostly I just don't accept the negatives I read.  Except for not having enough time to see if it will break down, I've exhaustively checked every option more than once.  Most complaints about the 4250 not doing this or that are because the reviewer or user didn't take the time to find the proper path or method.  Another example -- a major review that said you can't change a planned route once it is entered.  I planned a route for my current 1000-mile round trip.  I then Optimized and Saved it.  I went back and added a new stop (Append) and re-optimized.  I went back and deleted one of the stops and re-optimized.  All went perfectly.  It even found for me a shoe store in a huge shopping center -- the shopping center wasn't mapped, but the shoe store was pinpointed on my GPS and it told me I was there when I got to within 50 feet.The new firmware definitely improves responsiveness and re-routing if you make a wrong turn.  For example, a new stretch of highway was put in where the older instructions said to turn.  Before I was 100 feet on the new road, I heard the "calculating route" message and a corrected route taking me in from the opposite side was displayed.  Fantastic!  And that happened more than once!  (Lots of new roads on this trip.)  The map is the same NavTec map in use by all current GPSs -- an update is expected this Fall and hopefully that will resolve some of these.  I had no problems finding any of the POIs we chose -- that will certainly be hit and miss as on any GPS as places change over time.  But the AAA data was accurate and up-to-date to the last quarter.  We have been AAA members for many years and have always relied on the AAA tourbooks, getting new ones for every trip.  Now we don't have to get the newest annual book unless we want it -- the most recent updates can be downloaded every quarter to the 4250.We haven't yet tested the Bluetooth, but our phone is supposed to be compatible.  At this point using Bluetooth is problematic between any two devices, so it's just not a big issue for us.One thing I want to point out, is that Magellan appears to be addressing many concerns with the 4250 (the 2007 high end model) both with firmware updates and corrections in the manufacturing stream (later purchases don't have the same issues are the earliest ones).  They are also making changes is the 2008 line (4350, 4370, etc.) to address concerns like not being able to enter addresses with voice commands (the 4350 will have that as well as a "pedestrian" mode.Some more good things:  The touch screen is quite sensitive and almost always responds to a tap.  Occasionally, it will miss (just re-tap) or will pick up a double-tap (oops, go back) minor stuff.  The screen brightness is great, but definitely bright at night.  Volume and brightness can be adjusted with the Options menu and there you also can see your battery level.  The volume is orginally set to High -- too loud for our relatively quiet Camry, but that's fine with loud music.  We found no problems at all with the Magellan responding to our voice commands.  Normal tone of voice, picks up my low voice and my wife's higher voice with no problem at all.  I actually like the window mount.  Set it up properly, and it easly turns from side to side (driver to passenger) while staying in place for finger taps and remaining level to both views.I also had to contact Magellan Tech Support because of a difficulty signing up for the 2nd year warranty (it never told me it worked).  I got a response within 24 hours confirming my extended warranty.If we have any problems over time, I'll post here.  We are extremely happy with our purchase.  If you don't like some of the current concerns (no voice address input, 2007 map, etc.) wait for the new releases and pay a few hundred dollars more.  Or do like we decided -- get a great GPS and plan to upgrade in a couple of years when it's a lot better.  (You can see the new features for the 4350 series on the tigergps site -- Amazon will probably add that info soon.)
$review_summary.: Masterful, outstanding GPS

$REVIEW.: I guess I should have expected this case for the price I paid (which was much cheaper than it is now, only around 4 dollars I think).My lesson has been learned and I heed my warning to everyone out there. DO NOT GET FAUX LEATHER CASES! Especially ones so cheap, it just looks SO cheap and tacky. I feel like it's the equivalent of watching a 240p video on youtube, I can see every granule on the case.SECOND WARNING: the colors are not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures, especially the pink! I'm such a sucker, I got both.Actual case review: The stand sucks, it's disgustingly difficult to prop up the stand. I hate how you SLIDE it into the case, because it doesn't snap on the sides so it makes navigating the screen difficult a lot of the times. For example, trying to slide down my notifications from the top is really hard with that stupid turquoise case blocking the top.+ makes the case really fat and makes me want to chuck it at a wall. (which if i did, my nexus would probably fall out of it and probably crack)Please, get the moko slim with the pretty flowers instead. You'll appreciate paying more for a QUALITY case.

$REVIEW.: I've used several other stand cases before finally coming back to the original OEM case.  The case I first purchased was the same design as the OEM case but in black leather.  This gave a great refined look but also added a lot of thickness.  It also had a wider bottom fold in the stand/cover, making it very stable in the upright (video) position, but a bit too upright in the typing position.My next case was a leather slip case with two-position picture-frame style stand  on the back, allowing for it to stand in either portrait or landscape orientation.  This wasn't nearly as useful as it sounds and I very rarely stood it up in portrait mode.  Also, due to the lack of a front cover, I reverted to my previous case for travel.I finally picked up the OEM case (now reduced to about 1/2 the original price) after becoming tired of the added thickness of the leather cases.  The OEM cover adds the bare minimum in terms of added thickness while maintaining the full functionality of the fold-back stand design.  It sets up at a more comfortable angle for typing, but isn't quite as stable in upright/video position due to the narrower bottom fold in on the cover.  The edges are a bit sharp but not offensively so.  Overall I think it's the best original iPad case in terms of minimal thickness with a closing cover and fold-back stand.
$SUMMARY.: Great low-profile stand case.  Not quite as sturdy as I'd like in Upright position.

$review_text.: This unit is really great!  We recently got a 40" HD TV and needed a replacement for the VCR -- we wanted to record shows (and On-Demand movies) at a good enough quality for HD viewing.One option was DVR from Comcast for $10/month (which might or might not allow recording of On-Demand movies and transfer to computer for disc-burning).  Another option was using a computer with a video acquisition device and record to hard drive.  The third option was this unit for $110, delivered, from Amazon -- hands down the most practical choice.Though this unit doesn't record in true HD resolution, the quality is about the same (in 2 hour mode, 16x9) as regular 16x9 enhanced DVDs.  At first I was worried the recorded discs might not play on other DVD players; but they did, no problem at all on any of our equipment (that is, after the recording is finalized).  The recording time for a DVD-R disc (on high quality mode) was 2 hours and 8 minutes.  (On lower quality modes, it's 4+ hours and 8+ hours.)Navigating the menu system is easy enough, and each recorded disk is given a simple menu with the various recordings available to choose from (which by default have the date & time of recording as the title, but can be renamed).Upconversion of commercial DVDs is quite good (enough so that we're not that motivated to get a Blu-Ray player yet ;-).Our only complaints (which are very minor) are that the tray-eject is a little slow & noisy and that there isn't component video inputs (just composite video & S-Video inputs).  But it was easy enough to hook up to our cable box (or TV) to record from their outputs.This will be a great unit to have until Blu-Ray recorders become less expensive.

$REVIEW.: Seems very bright to me. It blinks lite about the room, in different colors, and certainly mimics a TV.I kind of think its sort of in 'action-movie' mode, as the lighting changes seem to be /kind of/ frequent.But it definitely shows thru to the outside of my home. Its smart. If someone needs a brighter model, they must be in a very brightly lit area.Typical streetlights or some low tv-watching lighting in that room do not deter its effect, they may enhance it  by toning it down a little. But its fine,  and very good on its own in a dark room. Or semi- dark! It saves electricity too, vs. the real TV that I have used for many years. Even when home&#8230;.! Just because..

$REVIEW.: The Velociraptors are getting a bad rap these days when most enthusiasts are gravitating toward SSD's


 Granted, the speed of the Raptor is pretty weak compared to the SSD but the price is still hard to beat, and the bang for your buck is considerably higher
 I have one of these running Windows 7 Ultimate and all of my programs/games and the load times are absolutely adequate for me


 At 150GB, it is close to what I would recommend as a MINIMUM for a proper system drive and that makes its $90 pricetag far more attractive than the $300 a similar capacity SSD would cost
 The noise is not an issue for me but make no mistake, it is far from silent


 Its a distinctive tone as well, kind of like a jet flying far overhead
 I have been up and running for two months and have had no issue out of the Raptor so far


 I am very satisfied with my purchase.

The quality of the recording is excellent.  I play the recordings through a set of old Bose noise-cancelling headphones.  The clarity exceeded my expectations.  The recorder comes with 10 folders already established.  When plugging into the USB port the unit shows up as a removable disk.  Each of the folder names can be modified easily; number of folders can be either expanded or reduced as necessary.  I travel a fair amount.  The ICD-UX200 recorder makes for a great MP3 player.  An inexpensive male-male 3.5 mm patch cord permits plugging into the car MP3 auxilliary jack.  All in all a very nice recorder and in my estimation a wonderful value.

$review_text.: If you have modest expectations, this tablet is going to fullfil them just fine
For $140 you get 90% of the features of other leading tablets, but paying less than half the price
I have it for four months know and I'm satisfied


Well built


Feels sturdy, unlike other tablets of this price range

It's very thin at 0.6" (it's slimmer than my phone!)


I think that 7" tablets are ideal size, because I find those 10" tablets to bulky to carry around (altough this varies from person to person).IMPORTANT NOTE: This tablet does not come with Market (Android App Store) installed by default

That does not mean that it can't be installed, but there are some steps that you need to do that some people may not find it comfortable
But it is actually easy
Here is a YouTube video that teaches you how to do that: [...]
This device have somethings that are ackward, like the position of the front-camera, the fact that it doesn't include physical volume buttons, or that the round button on the center is not home (it's back)
I also have to say, that sound from this is not good, so forget listening to music on this (even with headphones).SCREEN: Good quality screen

Colors are acurate
Reponse to touch is very good, it's similar to those Apple devices
Resolution is good as long as you don't read very small text, but for general purposes it's fine
On the downside, the accelerometer is TOO sensitive, so it badders sometimes because it's seems that the tablet "can't decide" whether it's on landscape or portrait


This particular problem can be solved buying the OrientationLock app from the Market (I think it's two bucks)


Brightness is adecuate for indoor use

Outdoor use is difficult, because the screen becomes very dim.PERFORMANCE: Very good speed

I haven't tried the latest tablets, but speed seems fine for me


There is no lagging like in other cheap tablets


If you install lots of apps, it can get a little bit slow, so watch out for that (specially games).BATTERY LIFE: It's kinda short (3-4 hours, depending on screen brightness and WIFI usage)

But at this price point it's not that bad
If you are going to use it a lot, consider getting a car charger on eBay (I haven't found one here on Amazon).Overall, this tablet has a very good value


I stongly recommend it for someone that needs a tablet but are on a budget.

$review_text.: I bought this for an overseas trip as an alternative to my studio setup, a full-size 4.5lb Induro AT-214 and 1lb Giottos ball-head. In short: I'm impressed. This is an excellent tripod.DESIGN:Tried and true: telescoping aluminum leg extensions with short-throw twist locks, three leg angles with full reversal for storage, a two-level telescoping reversible center column, and a ball head. The legs don't twist. The connection base appears to be made of the same solid cast metal as my Induro. No foam legs covers for cold weather, though.A few significant features are missing: an angle adjustment on the center column (e.g., Manfrotto 190), spring-loaded leg locks, and the ability to detach a leg to make a monopod. Dolica's TX570B150DS does the last; this TX570B150SL doesn't. There's also no way to attach the ball head to the legs absent the center column. Still, both versions come with a decent padded case and two hex keys.Actual weight is 2.64 lbs. Compacted height is 13.25&#34;. The packed case is 2/5 the height of my Induro case and half the weight. Taking the Induro anywhere always involves a mental calculation of whether I'll actually use the thing. This Dolica is like an overstuffed umbrella; I'd throw it in a backpack without a second thought. When set up, height to viewfinder with a 5D II (no battery grip) is 49&#34; (center collapsed), 54&#34; (center up one), and 60.5&#34; (center up two). At 6'1&#34;, I find it comfortable enough at 54&#34; and short at 49&#34;.My first copy had a noticeable tilt of about 2 degrees, I believed caused by a casting defect in the base. My replacement copy has no tilt. This is a nuisance only; it's easy to compensate with the ball head.BALL HEAD:Exceptional at this price. It's strong locked down. I had no qualms attaching my 5D II, battery grip, 200/2.8L with tripod collar, and 1.4X TC. A 20 pound dumbell on one side of the QR plate didn't cause any shift in position. Ball adjustments on all axes are smooth at partial tension. It's actually easier to use than my $150 Giottos.Twisting the base without the lock engaged is smooth. Engaging the lock raises the effort, but not consistently. Double-check that the head is screwed on tight before you rotate the head with high lock tension. It wouldn't be that hard to unscrew by accident.The ball doesn't shift position when it's being locked (unusual, this), but flex in the camera frame itself will cause some droop with telephoto lenses that aren't attached with a collar. The plate has excellent grip and secures tightly by hand or with a coin. It doesn't twist with my 5D II and 200/2.8 in portrait position.There's no trigger on the head to release the QR plate lock, so you need to loosen the top knob all the way and tilt the camera to raise it off the head. Not a big deal, just a bit slower than rigs where you can slide the plate out.STABILITY:Good for this size, material, and weight. Carbon fiber and wood damp vibrations better than aluminum, and heavy tripods do better than light ones. Clearly we're starting at a disadvantage. I did a few ad-hoc measurements. The setup was: Canon 5D II, 100/2, focused on a distant object, zoomed to 10X in Live View. I flicked the ball head hard and timed how long it took for vibrations to disappear. I did this twice for each configuration. I also tried my 200/2.8 (no lens collar) and did one trial with the Induro.All legs extended, center column down: 3 seconds (8 w/ 200mm) (46&#34; to base of camera) (Induro: 5 w/ 200mm)All legs extended, center column up one: 6 secondsAll legs extended, center column up two: 18 seconds (25 w/ 200mm)Smallest leg contracted, center column down: 1 secondSmallest leg contracted, center column up one: 3 seconds (42&#34; to base of camera)Smallest leg contracted, center column up two: 12 secondsResonant vibrations are not a strong suit with the center column raised. They have a definite period as the image shakes, stabilizes, and shakes again as the energy moves up and down the legs. Again, status quo for a tripod at these specifications. Hanging a 10lb bag from the bottom ring reduced the times only slightly, perhaps 10%. If the bag swayed even the slightest bit, leg flex was visible on the screen. I wouldn't attach a weight unless part of it was sitting on the ground.Other best practices:* Don't ever extend the second center-column extension if you can help it. This tripod won't stabilize in any sort of breeze at full extension. If you can, drop the center column entirely and retract the last leg sections.* With long lenses (&#62;135mm), use 'Live View' mode for long exposures. Mirror Lockup (MLU) doesn't wait long enough to let vibrations die.* For short lenses with both center extensions down, MLU is fine.* Use the camera's self-timer or a remote release.* Use tripod collars with long lenses to balance the rig weight directly above the ball-head. This'll also make it harder to knock the tripod over.* Disable image stabilization with slow shutter speeds. If it's very windy or the center column is raised, leave it on for faster shutter speeds.IN SUM:For this price, I like it. A lot. It shames the Manfrotto MKC3-H01, another ~$75 travel tripod I reviewed that has only greater base height in its favor. The closest alternative is MeFoto's A0350Q0T. That one costs twice as much and looks for all the world like the same model. Save for the defect in the first copy, there's no significant fault to this Dolica. Shorter folks with lenses under 300/5.6 may well find it equal to any purpose, travel or not.I'll update if I discover problems with extended use.
$SUMMARY.: Cheap, light, stiff, and all the tripod most folks need

$REVIEW.: As much as I hate to give a positive review to a canon product, this really is an excellent camera.  It is very easy to use and understand and is very small (easily fits in a pocket).  This camera also uses SD cards which are easy to collect and exchange as needed.  Additionally, the camera produces good IQ for a P&S.;  The camera is also fast to take a picture, it isn't like some other P&S; cameras that flash orange lights and pre flashes for 30 seconds before actually making the exposure.As for the negative, the software that comes with the camera is quite mediocre and difficult to use.  If I didn't have a card reader I'd be pretty upset about that.
$SUMMARY.: Some good, some bad

$review_text.: This is the second of these machines that I've had; the first one had to be replaced because it became essentially inoperable after 3 weeks. The new one lasted 1 month before it began misbehaving: it won't record unless it's left on, the controller doesn't work as it should. Yes, when it works, the quality of the recording is good, and that's all I do with it. Nothing fancy or demanding. And yes, as a technical writer I would say that the manual is in need of an overhaul. I will give it one more try, going back to the default values and going through the setup procedure once more. If it fails again, it goes back for a refund. Panasonic should do better by its customers.

$REVIEW.: Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class

I have this TV as well as another Samsung in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful
 The only drawback with this TV it's not a smart TV and you would need to use a WiFi router like Google TV or Roku to get it to connect to the internet


 This is why I gave this TV 4 stars instead of 5
 But if this is not an issue than this TV would be a smart purchase.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person


Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage


Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step when looking for TV's is what features come with it

 I have listed a few for you here:- This Samsung comes with a technology called Clear Motion Rate (CMR)


 CMR can depict fast-moving images with sharp detail and vivid contrast while eliminating image distortion.- This TV also comes with Wide Color Enhancer Plus (WCEP)


 WCEP allows you to witness the entire RGB spectrum on your screen to bring.- The final feature that I thought was a good add-on that comes with this TV is ConnectShare

 ConnectShare lets you watch videos, play music, or view photos from a USB connection without needing to use a PC or special equipment
Simply plug your USB device or drive directly into your Samsung TV's USB port and watch on the big screen with friends and family (Here is how you could get around user wireless router for this TV)


 You can put movies or other content onto a thumbdrive you push it on to the TV directly.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.



$SUMMARY.: Samsung makes great TV's that are best in their class, but be aware this is not a Smart TV.

$review_text.: This Degen is a nice compact (shirt pocket sized) little radio. I was in the market for a FM pocket sized radio with good quality and in my search I found this one, it was not much more price wise and had Short Wave (Which is also an interest of mine) MW (AM) a voice recorder and MP3 capabilities. Its the perfect size I was looking for its only slightly bigger the an I-POD classic, fits easily in a shirt pocket, it was some weight to it, so its not flimsily. Sound in the speaker is pretty good, its 50 mm and it produces a descent sound. It DX's in FM station really well, does good with middle wave (AM) (I live in a location with bad reception-one reason I got this radio is I have an Sirius XM radio and I transmit it around the house and property and I can listen to it on FM it works perfectly) and the short wave is to be expected in that it DX's in the big boomers, your probably not going to DX in far away lower powered stations, but its not bad. Its pretty easy to use and there's lots of per sets on all three bands. The MP3 recorder is easy to use, you just plug it into your computer and drag music into its folder. Battery life (rechargeable) is very good, You can get 10-15 hours, or more. It takes 7 hours to fully charge and more if you use the computer like 9-10 hours. Its not a bad radio at all.

$REVIEW.: This black stylish, silicone MOSOUND Bar individual portable Bluetooth speaker from MOCREO charges up in 4 hours using a provided USB charging cable and at full charge provides up to 6 hours of medium-volume music, radio, audio books, and so on. This is done either by the speaker's Bluetooth V2.1 connection with the computer, smartphone, or tablet device or by direct connection between the MOSOUND speaker and the device using the provided 3.5 mm dual-pronged audio cable plugged into the MOSOUND Aux in port. A pleasant female voice announces Bluetooth or Aux connection, implied disconnection ("Hi, I'm ready for a connection."), or auto "Power off". The device also accepts a 16GB TF/Micro-USB card for playing music without Bluetooth. The TF, Aux, and Micro head ports are under a rubber strip on the side near the power "on" and the phone answering button.This waterproof MOCREO speaker produces very nice, medium loud stereo wireless sound (120 Hz to 18 kHz) from front-firing speakers over 32 feet (~10 meters) through two walls (out to a maximum 43 feet line of sight). Its Bluetooth and IPX4 waterproof rating (splashing liquid from any direction, but not immersion) solves the problem of taking expensive smartphones, computers, and tablet devices into a hot bathroom with lots of moisture in the air from a shower: this speaker can sit on the bathroom sink on slightly raised legs and play on with clear sound, with your device safe in the next room. Or you can take it to the beach. If a phone call interrupts music play, tapping the side phone symbol on the speaker's side allows call completion with a strong, clear signal. Con: operating the "+" and "-" controls for raising volume/changing tracks takes a slight learning curve. My Highest Recommendation. Five FLEXIBLE Stars. (MOREO stereo speaker, USB charging cable, 3.5 mm audio cable, User's Guide, 1 year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use by the original purchaser. This item was provided by the manufacturer for testing and an impartial review.)
$SUMMARY.: MOCREO SOUND BAR IS AN EXCELLENT WATERPROOF BLUETOOTH SPEAKER

$REVIEW.: I had to rebuild one of our computers as after a storm it wouldn't come back on... go figure since it was shut down properly. From there I had replaced most of the internals and everything was working except the DVD-RW drive was being picky--- it would work when it felt like it. I looked at the date and it was from 2006. For that I felt it served its time and I had no qualms in replacing it. Since we really do not use it except when I need to do repairs to the system or load program software that is on disc--- I was not willing to break the bank on a replacement. This one also replaced a IDE drive so no more ribbon cable which was nice as it was always a bugger to fold in the case.The only hiccup was in my system configuration. It would persist that the device was not working properly and would not recognize it properly. After a little searching I found out that in Windows 7's registry there were a possibility of four entries that could prevent this from working---- I had one of the four, deleted it, rebooted the system and Voila! it was up and running.I do not fault the drive as it was my computer/ other drive that started the whole problem. This one is definitely faster, quieter, and for the price.... it can't be beat for a DVD-RW drive. On our other computer where I do use the drive quite a bit I am tempted to replace it with one of these as well since I can also ditch the IDE cable.Update 12/2012-- I just setup a new machine and bought another one of these drives. It once again worked very well and installed without a hitch. I have one piece of software that is very particular to install--- for some reason the original disc is hit or miss, but the copy that I made works perfectly. I gave the original a shot and it failed with the install, switched over to the copy and all was fine. Since that has been my only snafu and it has tricked up several other systems/ drives as well, it doesn't bother me at all. I still recommend it and may be in for a third if our one other drive gets to be picky in opening.... needless to say this is a new behavior!

$review_text.: When the 790SW first came out, I read a positive review in a newspaper on it. At the time, I decided that its ruggedness & water resistance were worth having but I wasn't in the market for a new camera at the time.This summer, I started researching the Stylus SW's and decided to buy an 850 from Amazon, based mostly on what I read here. I took it on a two week cruise to Europe as soon as I got it. The xD card is not a problem for me - even my local supermarket carries them. I bought my 2 gig one from Target but would have bought online if I'd had the time. I've had the camera since October 8, 2008.In Italy and Croatia, xD cards were readily available in the local camera shops.A bigger problem for me is the battery. It is tiny and fairly easy to recharge but I found I need to recharge it every day that I use the camera. My next purchase will be two additional batteries. I would accept a bit more camera bulk for a more capatious battery and the ability to charge it without removing it from the camera.You DO need to be careful not to put the battery in the wrong way but if you look CLOSELY at the camera, it's pretty obvious. I wonder how long the tiny red plastic catch that releases the battery so you can get it out, will last?Picture quality is plenty good enough for my purposes and I take all my pix on the 4MP setting. I was especially pleased with the low light capabilities with the flash switched off.I DID read the manual but I found that it was just as easy to push buttons on the control panel and scroll through the menus to do what I needed to do. I tried the video once & it's OK but I can't see me using it much.I haven't used the underwater capability yet and I do have the floating wrist strap but would want to have the floating neck strap before taking my 850SW to the beach.I would like to have the option of an optical viewfinder but this is in no way a deal killer for me.This should really be a 5 star review but I never give ANYTHING 5 stars!
$SUMMARY.: But I really LIKE the 850SW & I'm glad I bought one!

$review_text.: I bought and used thisSamsung 2494SW 24" Black LCD Monitora little over a year ago from a local electronics store to go with my MacBook desktop set up.Overall I am very happy with the performance this monitor has given me. The 1080p resolution is sharp as ever coming from a regular outdated LCD monitor. The color it produces is not completely the same as my Macbook because it uses LED while this monitor uses LCD, but there is no subtle changes in color between the two displays. The contrast it colorful and the brightness is perfect for any lighting situation. This model also features a pretty useful dynamic setting that changes the brightness and contrast depending on what you're doing (like reading, watching movies, etc.).The only downside I'd like to point out with this monitor are the touch sensitive buttons; You can't see or feel them in the dark! For me it was kind of annoying to adjust the brightness when I need to sometimes (it was mostly a hit or miss on hitting the right button) but turning the monitor off was quite easy since it's the one closest to the blue on light. As I also own a Mac, I cannot adjust the brightness of the monitor from my keyboard like it would with anApple LED Cinema Display. That doesn't really matter for me though since the Apple display is way too expensive for me just to have that feature.I also wanted to point out that assembly was kind of scary for me because as I got to the part where I attach the base to the monitor, I'd have to insert a large piece of metal into the back of the monitor that just wouldn't go in! The instructions were simple and looked easy plus I was sure I was doing it right, but I was quite nervous I was about to break the thing while doing that step!This model does not have a HDMI port because it's not meant to be an HDTV and should also have built-in speakers if it was, but I still have hooked up my PlayStation 3 on this monitor (with a HDMI->DVI converter) and just hooked up the audio to an external speaker that I have. Watching movies and games from this monitor could give me a paper cut while watching from this monitor, it's that sharp! Ouch!The good:- Value. Price is decently affordable compared to the Apple LED Cinema Display.- 1080p high resolution.- The circular base swivels left and right.- Great color, speed, super-bright brightess and contrast.The bad:- Touch sensitive buttons is good since you won't get any clicking noises, but they could've at least put some markers (like braille) on the buttons so it's easier to locate the right button that I wanted to press in the dark.
$SUMMARY.: Really decent LCD monitor for the price.

$review_text.: Anyone who agrees that today's gadgets are likely to become obsolete in 2-3 years and therefore not subject to a lot of wear and tear before they get replaced by the 'next generation' may agree that an iPad creen protector isn't exactly a 'must have' accessory. Especially when the protected 'touch screen' is touched mostly with by fingers or generally soft objects.I was able to verify the claim that the cover will protect the screen from scratches. On the other hand, the claim that placing this on top of iPad's screen 'improves clarity' is clearly inaccurate. Placing an extra layer on top of the original screen can only reduce clarity even so slightly and it simply can't improve it. I can't express an opinion concerning the 'glare reduction' claim because I didn't have a sunny day to verify it during my testing. My subjective impression was that the iPad was slightly less responsive to touch while the screen was on, especially when using a stylus.This screen protector is delivered as kit, complete with instructions, a soft cloth for prepping the iPad's screen prior to applying the protector, the protector itself delivered in a pristine state between its own 2 protective layers and a little squeegee used to push any bubbles on the side. It is possible to install this and only have a few bubbles but doing it well is a learned skill and, at this price, it would have been nice if a 'practice' item came with the package.Considering that I personally dispute the need of any screen protector for an iPad, the difficult to justify (high) price, the imperfect outcome (bubbles) of my one attempt at installation and my subjective impression that the screen was slightly less responsive to touch post-installation, the fair rating for this product should be '3 stars'. I am not going to keep it on my iPad but I'm not going to have any screen protectors on mine. On the other hand, I respect the fact that some may want some protection for their gadget and, for anyone who needs one, this specific product is probably 'Okay' even though a little on the expensive side. Mitigating the high price is the Amazon-backed one-year warranty and my personal experience is that Amazon is very serious when it comes to honoring their commitments to customer satisfaction.
$SUMMARY.: Basic protector, basically not needed (in my view), not cheap

$review_text.: Short version:  It works, a bit tricky to set up,  Wifi works intermittently.Long version:I bought this card to pair my new ipad to my DSLR camera.The new ipad's resolution makes it a great way to make sure my shots are in focus.I only care about direct mode (wifi ad-hoc network).  This allows you to transfer photos from the camera to the ipad without a wifi base station.  It the only sensible option in the field.Firstly, you'll have to be a fairly tech-savvy person to get this set up and working in direct mode.  Otherwise expect to call customer support.  I'm sure they'll walk you through it.The step-by-step instructions in the application are pretty good, but they do overlook a few critical setup details that can only be found in the FAQ.I was amazed that RAW files worked from my Canon EOS 5D mark III.  Adobe apps can only handle this new cam's RAW if you download a pre-release converter.  Maybe this is built into the IOS platform and Eye-FI just piggybacks.  Still, its good news.Direct mode is working intermittently.  I mostly capture time-lapse and so I need to download a long sequence of shots.  But every few minutes the direct connection drops, often in the middle of downloading a photo.  When viewing the ipad's Wifi config screen, the Eye-Fi's SSID dissapears.  Eventually (several seconds to several minutes)  it reappears and reconnects and photo downloads resume.FWIW, I am in downtown SF and the 802.11 spectrum is crowded here.  That MIGHT be part of the problem.  I'll be trying this out in the middle of nowhere during the Lyrid meteor shower.  I would REALLY prefer to validate new gear before going into the field.  If it works there I will bump up a star.  if not, I will bump down.

$REVIEW.: This router does not really work across multiple WANs since it balances so aggressively that any IP restricted web sessions will fail
 This is a major limitation and I would strongly suggest avoiding this router as a result.Also:* There is no QoS by IP address or MAC address, only by physical ports
 You can reserve bandwidth by port and IP range (and can bind MACs to IPs), but that sets aside the bandwidth and isn't actually a solution.* As far as I can tell, there are routing bugs in the firmware

 Setting up custom routes, in order by precedent, doesn't seem to work right
 Forcing specific traffic onto specific WANs also seems inconsistent
 I could usually find more than one way to do things, but I shouldn't have to.I would strongly recommend trying a different router if you want to use both WANs
 I'm replacing mine with a Peplink Balance 30, so hopefully I'll have better luck with that.Update: The Peplink Balance router is fantastic and I highly recommend it for doing multi wan


 They have a 2 and 3 wan model (plus larger enterprise models).

$REVIEW.: I originally bought this hub because I wanted to charge/sync my iPhone while having other things plugged in, and with my computer only having two usb ports, then I had to buy a hub. So far this thing works flawlessly, I haven't had any problems with it. When I first got it, it came with an aluminum base, a power supply, and a screw to mount it on pretty much any surface. I highly recommend this product to anyone.

$REVIEW.: First of all, it's small, and this is a good thing.  Once plugged into a USB port there's no reason to ever take it out, and if you happen to drop the laptop (as we did with a prior adapter) there's much less risk of any damage.The adapter installed easily and we were connected to our home network in just a few minutes without any problem.  Range and performance is great.There might be less expensive adapters but I'd rather spend the extra dollar or two using a brand I know and trust, and I've used TP-Link before with the same great results.

$REVIEW.: Let's start off with the positive, for less than one of the new, top-of-the-line Kindle Fires, and WAY less than any iPad, you get a lot of stuff for the asking price for this tablet/laptop. You get a fully functional computer that is capable of anything you might want to do online. You get a good battery life, fast boot times, and all sorts of free apps.  This device would work VERY WELL for most students (who don't need to print too often), and for writers on the go. The device is small and portable, and is fairly solid.======================================================================================EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:PROS:-price, is very reasonable for a tablet which is also a computer-fully functional online features (e-mail, web-browsing, office applications suite, etc.)-good battery life-fast boot times (SSD for local storage and OS)-free appsNEUTRAL:-you get 100GB of space on Google Drive (BUT, it is only free for 2 years once activated)-has 2 USB ports-has 1 headphone port-has 1 laptop lock port-has 1 HDMI-OUT port-has 1 SD-card reader port-Does not run Android apps (ONLY Chrome apps)CONS:-pretty much online-only-file transfers and OS in general are pretty clunky/old-school-the keyboard is non-standard and takes a lot to get used to, and it is missing several keys I consider to be critical-my unit arrived bowed (may just be my unit, though)======================================================================================That is about all of the good stuff I can name. So, on to the bad stuff.You should know up front, this device is meant to be an online-only device. It is not meant to be used offline, and in fact for the most part it WILL NOT work when offline. You need to plan ahead if you need to use it offline, and download your files to the local drive, etc. Speaking of files, the operating system looks sort of like Windows/Mac-OS, but doesn't really work like them. File transfers is a perfect example, transferring files involves lots of extra steps that feel clunky and very Linux-like. To get files off a USB drive, once the drive has been plugged in and recognized, you either have to figure out how to get the context menu up with the touchpad, or drag and drop files to where you want them to go. And there are no windows in the operating system. Just one window will appear, with a sidebar listing available locations on the drive. It all feels very old-school, and not intuitive at all, especially for anyone who has never used a computer prior to Windows XP/Mac-OSX. To this day I do not know where to look to find out how much space I have available in local storage.The device comes with 100GB of free* space in the Google Drive online storage ("cloud") space -- which helps relieve the relatively small size of the local storage drive. HOWEVER, that free* space comes with an caveat, and the caveat is that the space is only free for 2 years once activated on the main Google account for the device. That is kind of outrageous. A certain portion of extra online storage space should have been made available free to owners of a Google chromebook for the lifetime of the device. What they are doing is akin to TIVO trying to sell a DVR with only 5GB of local storage, and then trying to rent users of that computer storage space online ("in the cloud") for the life of the device to make up for the very small local storage, minus an introductory period. I cannot imagine anyone putting up with that from TIVO, so why from Google? If this device is intended to be a main computer for anyone, then that 2 year expiration is going to be always looming on the horizon, waiting to ruin everything.The keyboard takes a LOT of getting used to. It is MUCH smaller than a standard or even small-scale laptop keyboard. Additionally, keys I consider to be vital, are missing (like the delete key, the home key, the end key, the page-up key, and the page-down key to name a few). That takes some SERIOUS adjustment for anyone who types professionally for a living (as I do). There ARE hot-keys you can learn to do some of those things, and to replace things like the Windows-Key+L to lock the screen (it is CTRL+SHIFT+L on a chromebook, you're welcome ^_- ). There are also additional keys on the device that aren't normally on regular devices, such as a reload button, forward and back buttons, and other browser controls. I pretty much never use them, because I am so trained to use the controls on the screen instead.Also, if you might think that a Google device should be able to run Android applications, you should know that a chromebook cannot. The chromebook can run applications that are available in the Chrome store, but NOT the Android/Google-Play store.Finally, I don't know if my unit was just damaged or weirdly manufactured, but it arrived bowed. There is a slight curve to the entire unit that makes me constantly want to straighten it out whenever I look at it, by grabbing both ends and flexing it the opposite way of the bow, but I am sure that would harm the device.Overall, the device is fine for what it is: a glorified web-browser with its own built-in battery and screen and keyboard. Everything you can do online (minus Flash stuff), you can do with a Chromebook. But, it cannot run Android apps, and its offline capabilities are almost non-existent, the file and operating system are clunky, printing will require you get a printer than can print from "the cloud", etc. etc. It isn't a BAD device, but it isn't a full tablet, and it isn't a full computer. It is a web-browser dressed up to look like a tablet that is also a computer. That may work fine for LOTS of people, but make sure you know what you are getting before you buy.3.5 stars (rounded down to 3, since Amazon doesn't doesn't allow partial stars)

$REVIEW.: I bought this case due to recommendation by my brother in law, who's an IT guy. Not sure what so many are complaining about, look at what you get for the price. I didn't even realize it came with its own power supply. I used it as a test PSU for the following configuration and it powered the MB just fine.I'm using the case for my home server, which houses my micro ATX AMD A55M P33 motherboard, AMD A8 3850 FM1 Fusion 2.9 GHz quad core APU w Raedon HD6550D DX11, Logisys 550w power supply unit, 4 Western Digital 3.5" SATA Green drives, and an ASUS BD optical drive.It came with one of the power leads detached, but that was an easy fix. The case was not damaged in any way. The metal is thin and very light. Have to kind of work it a bit to get the side access panels to sit properly but that's no big deal, either. Motherboard fit perfectly out of the box. Had no issues replacing the rear panel connection cutouts with the ones that came with my MB. The two front USB ports are 3.0.Looks very good sitting as a headless server in our home network. I like the LED light, also.

$review_text.: I posted my inital review for the right product under a different supplier.  My bad sorry, but I did purcase this card as you can see with the verified purchaser tag.I have an Nikon D90. I purchased the 8G San Disc Extreme III card 30MB/S and a Transcend 16G class 6 card at the same time. The San Disc Extreme 3 card is incredibly fast. I get 100 pictures (4.5 frames per second) at fine resolution before the camera stops to buffer in 24 seconds. The Transcend card gets 17 photos on the same settings then pauses to buffer. If you have the camera that can take full advantage of this write speed this fast card is worth the investment. No more cringing while I wait for my camera to clear its buffer so I can take more pictures.I like to shoot at 4.5 frames. It gives me a lot to pick through when I edit, but a lot can happen in a fraction of a second that can make a photo good or bad. Having the capability to hold down the shutter release and rattle off large bursts of photos is important to me.I have found that 8G is a good size for SLR Photography. In my opinion bigger cards are putting a lot of eggs in one basket.I posted a video test demonstrating this products incredible write speed.  You can find it by clicking on my name and searching for this product.  I'd repost it here but I deleted from my computer.I have been using the card for several months.  I have about 10 different cards that I use and I can honestly say that this is my favorite.  In addition to writing fast it emptys a lot faster which comes in handy when I'm in a hurry to leave the house with my fastest card and it's full of pictures.  I have not had any write/read errors.  I'd get another one, but I know the price on this model will continue to fall.

$review_text.: I've had these headphones for about two weeks now, and although they are not the best headphones I've ever owned they are very good. I think the first thing that will impact the owner will be the obvious effort put into the construction and design. From the well crafted box to the incredible storage case, it should be no surprise that the headphones themselves are also very well built.Craftsmanship:Although the package is very well done it is just a package so I won't spend anymore time on it. Moving onto the storage case, you will notice the quality control put into the engineering and production. The case is a hard clam-shell design that opens a full 180 degrees. With two zippers it very user friendly, and the hard shell design makes for a lot of stability. After opening it you'll see the headphones and a small red bag that contains the accessories. Removing the headphones and focusing on the bag you'll note that the bag Velcros onto the inside of the case. I would have preferred that the Velcro used was sewn into the case or that the fabric inside the case was all Velcro, but the adhesive style Velcro works fine.The construction of the headphones is where the majority of effort into quality can be found. From the brushed aluminum earpiece arms to the soft vinyl padding, the headphones are both beautifully made and are very comfortable. The folded vinyl earpieces provide a soft and comfortable fit over the ears. The hard plastic parts are solid and thick enough to provide quite a bit of durability.Comfort and Extended Use:There are two parts to consider when it comes to these headphones and their comfort. First is that they are Noise Isolating. This means that the design of the earpieces is dedicated to silencing outside noise and funneling the audio from the earpieces. In this respect the headphones work very well. The noise isolation is nearly 100%, to the point that your own heartbeat is very prominent while wearing. But this does cause an some issues when noise isolation is not needed. A big issue is that the design does not allow for breathing. During extended use the lack of moving oxygen will make for added heat to the ears. The design also doesn't allow for much bleed away, and although this may be good for people around you that do not want to listen to your music, it also creates a very tiresome effect during extended use. In cases where I do not need noise isolation I could only wear the headphones for about an hour before my ears became too tired to use longer.Perhaps these headphones are best used for situations where noise isolation is needed. Airports, events where a lot of people are around, mowing the lawn, and so on. I myself will most likely use them while mowing the lawn or working out in my woodshop where noise isolation is needed. However during normal headphone needs I will use my other non-noise isolating headphones.Audio Quality:Although the audio quality of these headphones is high, it is not the highest I have heard, in fact my Turtle beach gaming headset provides much better audio. Why is this? Well, for the most part these headphones favor the low-end audio stream...perhaps too much. Although good for bass audio needs like hip hop music, the headphones fall very short on higher-end audio music like pop. And even though the quality of the audio output is determined by the quality of the input, these headphones still drown out the mid and high range with the best input I have. Perhaps this can be rectified with the additional purchase of a headphone EQ, but as they are the sound quality leaves much to be desired.So if you intend to use these with your iDevices or to listen to streaming music on Youtube, you should expect headphones that do not favor all ranges. I myself found that only some music sound very clear on these headphones. Metallica's S&M; album was rich and bold, but groups like Coldplay or Micheal Jackson were cut down by the low-end output.Accessories:It obvious by the accessories that the producers of this piece had not only quality in mind but also usability. These headphones come with multiple cables for every need and adapters for plane travel. Although I will only need one cable during my use of these, having multiple options is nice to have just in case. You should know that the cables will need to be firmly pressed into the headset as they will sound terrible or off balance if not fully seated.In the end these are not the best headphones on the market in terms of the sound quality, but the attention to usability and the effort put into the construction show that Brainwavz are a company to keep a close eye on in the future. If I had to make a suggestion it would be that a internal EQ was built into the headset. My Turtle Beach headphones have a three phase EQ that greatly affects the sound quality depending on the audio. This EQ addition would have been great for these headphones and would have done wonders in providing much better audio output.In short:Construction 5/5Comfort 4/5Audio Quality 3.5/5Usability 4.5/5A soft 4 overall.*Provided at no charge in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: I've had 3 of these in an Antec P180B case for about 3 years now, and just added a fourth to replace the last of the Antec TriCool fans that came with the case (it failed like the other 2).Admittedly, this is a quiet, cool case design (solid, dampened panels, good ventilation with few direct openings), but with all 4 S-FLEX SFF21F fans at full speed (one front intake, one on CPU heatsink, one in the hard drive tunnel, and one on the back), in addition to a 120mm fan inside the Corsair HX620 PSU and twin 80mm fans on the Gigabyte GTX 460, the machine whispers very quietly in my very quiet home office.There is a little bit more of a low-frequency "tonal" quality to the sound (sort of like a wooden pan flute) than some other fans I've heard, but it's still very "whooshy" it certainly is nowhere near the high-frequency "whine" of the average laptop or cheapo desktop fan.So far the fluid dynamic bearing design has lasted well, and these things move a LOT of air for the speed.

$review_text.: I bought this, like many others, to provide signal to both the Left and Right inputs of my subwoofer (Energy ESW-8HG)

 First, I'll comment on the product, then the applicationProduct:Build quality, although more basic than most Monster products, is more than satisfactory

 The gold plated connections are a must, and the cable didn't seem to have any issues with shielding (although on a sub application, it can be tough to tell due to the frequency reproduction capability of a sub)

 My Rosewill subwoofer interlink cable, which I at times have felt fit somewhat loosely into its connection, fit snugly into this which gave me confidence


 The price was great (as usual - thanks Amazon!), and shipping was as fast as it always isApplication notes:First, I'd like to comment on the 3dB of gain issue


 3dB (when dimensionless) represents a DOUBLING of power

 However, there is no way to magically double the strength of your audio signal


 Splitting a signal actually lowers the total power available for the amp (any connection causes a connector loss)
 However, whether you see a boost in signal to the amp (assuming a powered sub woofer) will depend on how it is configured

 If it uses half of its power to amplify each channel, then yes - supplying a signal to both will likely get you more power to the woofer itself since now the amp is amplifying two signals and not just 1
 However, this will change from amp to amp, as I found out.As mentioned above, I tried this as part of my Energy ESW-8HG subwoofer setup


 I had been having problems with the sub cutting out, and as part of my troubleshooting process thought I'd see if this made a difference


 It did not (but it was not the fault of the product, as you'll see below)However, and be sure to read this part - in my discussions with the Energy Tech/Warranty support folks, I learned that although the sub does have an input for L and R, in a mono sub application a signal should ONLY be supplied to one of the 2 (in my case, the L)


 Using both the left and the right is intended to be a speaker level input option that many sub manufacturers provide as a flexibility feature (can sell this sub to more users, since not all AV recievers have subwoofer out)

 Therefore, supplying a mono subwoofer signal to both channels can DAMAGE your subwoofer's internal amp and/or the sub itself (if it gets overdriven).Bottom line - if you determine that you could benefit from this connector - then buy with confidence, but make sure that your audio configuration warrants this plug, as I'd hate for you to damage your equipment

$REVIEW.: I keep coming back to these ear buds because, for the money, they sound pretty good.  I like the in-ear (noise isolating buds) because they really are effective at blocking the noise of the outside world.  I can never position the regular buds like the ones that came with my iPod so they sound good. These hold their position to achieve the correct sound.  Some people don't like the in-ear buds, I do. They have awesome bass but lack a bit of definition in the high-end compared to more expensive buds.They have a sliding volume control on the cord. Most don't...  Sometimes it's the easiest way to mute turn off the sound quickly rather than fumbling around with touch-screens and buttons. I like this feature.My big complaint with these is they are cheaply made.  The cords fail. The silicone shock restraints wear out and break. I stick with them because they are cheap enough I can buy 6 sets for the price of a single more expensive high-end set. So if they break or I lose them, my day is not ruined.  I've tried others but they don't sound 10 or 20 times better to justify a 10-20x price.  Your priorities may differ. I think they sound at least as good as the Apple buds that came with my iPod.

$review_text.: This is my second purchase of a Griffin product, and in general, it does get me what I wanted, but it does have one irritating issue.  After much frustration, I finally got all 4 channels programmed to use the international radio frequency my automobile radio supports.  However, when I start the car, the unit almost always seems to pick some random new radio frequency, on whichever of the 4 channels it happens to use.  That is, even though I have programmed all 4 channels to 87.9, the act of car ignition results in a different number appearing on the unit, (with the iPod turned on).  What is really peculiar is if I then flip through the 4 channels, all will say, and act properly, at 87.9.  So, for example, start the car, turn on the iPod, you get static, look at the iTrip, and it might say 101.5.  You hit the big round button and it shows you all four channels are at 87.9, and the one that was showing 101.5 now shows 87.9.  Of course, all 4 channels now play your selected music just fine.So three stars because the iTrip loses the initial channel upon start up.  Oh, and sometimes it will lose it in the same way if you turn off your car and go to the setting on your car that allows your radio to work while the car is not running.  Interestingly, if you flip the ignition key really fast, it will sometimes stay on the same station.As for general performance, it's not too bad.  I do use it in stereo mode, and most of the time the music plays without interruption.  Sometimes, when pulling into a parking lot, next to a running car, you get static, even though the iTrip is within 3 inches of the radio.  Parking close to some buildings seems to do the same thing (static).  (I'm guessing electrical interference in the walls?)All in all, I am satisfied with this product, and probably would have bought it anyway, even if I knew of the start up problem.  At least it gives me the music I wanted, as my radio does not support plugging in an iPod directly.P.S. I should also note that it works with the iPod nano - 5th generation, but will NOT charge that version of the iPod!!!  It however DOES charge the original classic iPod, and as I have both, that works for me.  That way I can leave the iPod classic in the car, and if somebody steals it, no big deal!
$SUMMARY.: This product has one irritating flaw

$REVIEW.: This is the worst router in the world. I get random horrible lag...sometimes in the worst of times(ie when I buy something and the page won't load so I have to refresh). I'm using the stock firmware. I don't care if DD-WRT is better, I believe the router should work and be functional first with it's firmware. I wish companies like this would have better quality control...even if it is just a firmware issue.

$review_text.: Without the North America NT map software this GPS unit is worthless as a navigation tool (in a car).With the North America NT map software this GPS is amazing.I still have a lot to learn, but what I have learned on Youtube (the Garmin user manual explains nothing) has made a big difference.  If you do not want to spend the time figuring out how to use your GPS I would not recommend this unit.This GPS seems to be way off on way points, but I am a rookie and have been practicing with way point averaging to make the GPS more accurate for specific locations.  I do not think I have the GLONASS or other satellites locked in yet either.All in all, I love this GPS and am learning to use it day by day.Dr

$REVIEW.: 2-11-14 UpdateI  have had the replacement for a week and it works fine. It came from a different vendor (GMartGlobal still no short 3.5 cord or band) but it works as well as the first one. I had the local guy jack out my car audio, and now I can plug the amp right into the radio without the phone rigamarole ,,,1-31 UpdateIt quit working. Amazon will accept a return,,, I will tell you how the replacement fares,,,,I am virtually deaf and while they are trying to figure out a path forward after my cancer surgery, I am desperate not to loose something that has been important to me for sixty years - my love of music.  I have a set of Sennheiser wireless headphones that i use for tv, and some Bose headphones for music and JLab buds for portable situations but I just couldn't get enough volume out of them in most applications.I read the reviews of this amplifier and figured I would give it a try, and am I glad i did. I am able to hear again, at least for the devices I can plug inline to this FiiO miracle.  Nice set  of controls, and the equalizer helps too. I am not an audiophile so I can't be precise in my description of the features other than say they work.There must be some irony in all of this.  As i drive down to road listening to XM  on my phone  because I can't hear the receiver in the car, with the output of the phone running into this device and the output to the JLab buds.I do have several concerns, primarily that you can' listen and charge at the same time. I charge it at night and don't start using it most days til the afternoon as I have been averaging about 8 hrs on a full charge.  Also the vendor I purchased from  (HiFiMan) did not ship either the short 3.5 mm cable or the little rubber band discussed in some of the reviews.  It's not the end of the world as we know it,,, because at least I can hear again.

$review_text.: I've had this product for about a month now, i've filled it with all my pirated movies and music, it's wonderfully entertaining.  It was hard to find a decent free video converter because the zune only plays WMV format videos but the STOIK Video Converter 2 works well enough.  It's my first mp3 player, so i naturally love it, but i have to say, there's no advantage or disadvantage over my roomates 30 gig ipod.The wifi feature may be only on this mp3 player, but  it's worthless right now, i've only even detected one other zune before ever and i live in a large city, half a block from a campus.  Plus it eats the battery to leave the wifi on so even if more people had zunes, nobody will have it on or be looking at their community options.I enjoy the large screen, the feel and look of zune is nice too, very durable. CHARGES FULLY IN ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS!!!However, There are SERIOUS installation issues.  I had to call microsoft and have someone walk me through ripping a black hole in my computer and pasting random lines into it.  Whatever it was, it worked. I tried for hours to get the software to work on my own and finally caved, and embarrassedly called them.I consider myself somewhat computer savvy, and just installing this was a huge frustration.  If you experience this problem, don't waste your time, just call them.No other problems.  In fact, since i have so much pirated mislabled music, the software was awesome, it relabled all my music correctly and recognized it, plus it added album art.  sweet stuff.The headphones are awesome, magnetically sticking together to keep the cord from tangling when not in use. Plus they're not annoyngly white, like every single other persons ipod on campus.  They're black and don't annoyingly stand out against your clothing like ipod.The EQ for music... is very sub par, but you only notice that after plugging it into your home stereo, which you can adjust to fit.I'm very glad i took the risk and went with zune instead of ipod. BUT, If you're getting your mom or dad an mp3 player, get them an ipod, they can't deal with this.

$REVIEW.: The portable USB charger is about the size of a small candle or medium sized pencil sharpener, the USB plastic casing measuring 1.5 inches tall (not including the prongs) and about 1.25 in diameter. The included protective cap covers the USB plug's 3-prongs to prevent bending. There are no lights on this charger which I'm glad for since when on the go, I usually charge my devices at night in the same room I'm sleeping in and I prefer no extra lights to interfere with my sleep. This charger comes with a 12-month limited warranty.I was pleasantly surprised to find this USB charger charged nearly all of my USB devices using each device's USB charging cable:- iPhone4- iPad 1- Kindle Touch- Kindle Keyboard 3G- Nook Color- Nook Simple Touch- Jabra Drive Bluetooth In-Car SpeakerphoneBut it couldn't charge my Sony Reader PRS-T1. If wasn't for this one, this would be a 5-star product.I was able to charge any combination of the devices listed above with the exception of the Sony Reader with no problem, as stated in full-speed charging mode. I liked that the USB slot for the iPad is clearly marked in a bright green outline with 2.1 AMP notation so there is no mistaking which USB slot to plug it into.I would definitely recommend this portable USB charger, especially at the low price of this one.

$review_text.: This battery is intended for use with an iPod or iPhone, since it has a standard iPod docking connector.In that context, it works well.  I plugged it into my nearly-dead iPod and it recharged the device and gave me additional play time.It has a series of suction cups intended to make it stick to the back of an iPod.  Assuming you don't carry yours in any sort of case, the battery is meant to be unobtrusive and convenient to use.  I did see a problem with this feature...the suction cups are made of a rubber that is a dust magnet, and once they get dusty they don't stick any more.  They are not easy to clean, either.I'd say that this is a good battery if you are satisfied with it's single purpose.  If, like me, you carry a lot of USB-chargeable devices, you might want a battery that has a standard USB port and is much more flexible.

$review_text.: Pros:- Huge screen- Good color, good color sauturation, good gray scale (comparable to Plasma, better than LCD)- Not extremely weight and bulky given its size- Pretty good contrast- Has Ethernet ports and wireless ready (see cons too)- Best for large family room or theater room if you cannot install front projectorCons:- Blackness blackness blackness! Black is not enough, so- Contrast is not great because of blackness. Dark details is only comparable to LCD, not as good as Plasma and (good) front projector.- Reflective screen. This should not be problem if you have good window coverings. I became a gloss screen fan no longer like AG coated screen, but it could be a problem for some people.- It's hard to find a good stand for it. See other thoughsOther thoughts- 7' width and 55" height require room to set it up. Measure your room before ordering.- Make sure seller use white glove shipping. I ordered from Amazon and glad they set it up for me.- I found Bell'o NT2147 and Pinnacle TV8292 are specifically designed for 92840, but they are way too high. Right now I put TV on ground, we feel comfortable. I measured and highest recommended H for stand would be 12". more than that means neck pain.

And as a bonus, they come with a switch that allows you to set the speed on the fan as needed to cool your rig.The highest speed does generate a bit of noise, but it also generates the highest cooling, so decide if you want a cool case or more noise. If you want the least noise and the least cooling, move it all the way down. Naturally, the middle is just that. All around a nice set of options.

$review_text.: The reason I give it one star is a major design flaw:  the thing is physically too fat to fit into a lot of USB ports!  Look at it

 Whose idea was this?  Obviously if you buy something like this, you're gonna want to plug it in to a variety of yet-unseen computers.Well, the problem is that the USB ports on the front (and back) of many towers (many of the more common Dells and Compaqs, for example) were designed with a cable in mind, not a bulky object like this
 You'll find in many instances that you won't be able to bodily cram it in far enough for the OS to detect it!I don't have a problem with Lexar, and the engineering and software program behind this thing are certainly up to snuff, but the fact that you physically can't insert it into a variety of towers must be reckoned a deal-breaker
 Don't buy it:  you'll be sorry.However, Lexar, I must say, learned its lesson


 Look around on Amazon for "Lexar Jump drive GB" and you'll see some of their newer sticks, which have been designed to be much slimmer and therefore more universally plug-innable.

$REVIEW.: As with the majority of reviewers, I have no qualms about the handling of video signals
 My gripe is this; I use my switcher not for TV viewing but to matrix security video cameras


 Whenever there is an outage, the unit goes dead and requires manual toggling of the front panel power switch to turn it back on

 I have  two switchers located far from my monitor, 100 ft or more outside my house so each time I have a momentary outage (very common in my small town), my security cameras goes dead and and I have to run out to the remote location to turn it back on


 In most modern TV gear, the state of the machine is restored as soon as power is restored, but not this device

 For those who intend to use this switcher box far from the monitor, often in a bedroom,forewarn that if you have frequent outages, this could be a very frustrating box to use.

$review_text.: The Pentax Optio S4 is a superb camera; the fact that it's an ultra-compact camera as well makes it even more amazing.  I researched and tried out many different compact digital cameras before settling on the Optio S4.  I travel quite a bit and was looking for a camera that I could slip in my pocket without sacrificing too much in the way of quality images.  What I found in the Optio S4 is an extremely compact camera that sacrifices nothing with respect to image quality.The resolution, edge-to-edge sharpness and color rendition rivals or exceeds that of larger cameras, much less other compacts.  It's exposure metering is precise and handles backlit and mixed lighting scenes with ease.In terms of size, the Optio S4's closest competitor is the Casio EX-Z4.  The Casio is a bit slimmer, but it's taller and wider and the Optio S4 outperforms it in resolution and edge sharpness.  The Casio uses a folded lens system, which is innovative but detracts from its optical performance. Also, the Casio (at least the US version) does not offer a movie mode, something the Optio S4 does very well. The Optio S4 is so small it will fit inside an Altoids breath mint tin!Battery run time on the Optio S4 is quite acceptable and there are a number of built-in power saving features you can elect to activate.  As with most of the compacts, internal memory is small, so plan on buying a SD data card along with the camera.  A 64mb or larger card would be a wise purchase.Overall, the Pentax Optio S4 is a superb 4 mega pixel camera in a compact package.

$REVIEW.: I've personally reviewed quite a few of the noise canceling headphones over the months. Unless you can afford more than a thousand bucks for BOSE pilot-grade headphones, it seems the BOSE QCs are the best of the lot. And since I still can not  afford them at nearly $300, my second fave is the AT. Here's why and what I use them for:1. Convenient and stores easily in my pocket and luggage on a trip. I can wear them hanging on my neck. I can also sleep with it on.2. Can hear pretty much every conversation around you when you're wearing them with NC on.3. Battery lasts about a week. Nice!4. Works well paired with my Sena bluetooth speakers on my motorcycle helmet - can't do that with the Bose.Now, why it doesn't get 5 stars:1. Would be nice if you could detach the NC portion from the earplugs, and even the longer cord that attaches to whatever you're listening to. I fear one of those connection points will wear out at some point, like these types of headphones often do.2. Takes a bit of work to have them sit correctly in order to cancel out noise. Not all the time, but once in a while, it seems to leak noise and then you have to reseat the plugs in your ears. Mainly has happened on the plane, but I haven't noticed this as much when riding my motorcycle.

$REVIEW.: Well I received my Kindle Fire cover today and I can honestly say YOU WILL NOT be getting Rich Corinthian Leather, sorry. :-DWhat you will get is a solid value to protect and carry a device that cost under $200. The material used for this cover looks good with white embroidered stitching. Inside the cover you can store items like store reward cards etc.The Kindle Fire is held firmly in place at each corner with an elastic band that firmly holds the Fire from moving around. Whether this will be the case 6 months from now is a whole different matter, but once set inside the cover, the Fire is as snug as a bug in a rug. The backside of the cover is a nice soft felt. When the Fire is inside the cover it doesn't add a lot of bulk. One weak spot is the magnetic closing strap. It's not very strong but it does close.The bottom line is, you can't go wrong with this cover that costs $9 and qualifies for free shipping. It does a really nice job of protecting your Kindle Fire at an attractive price which is why I give it 5 Stars.
$SUMMARY.: Nice Cover and Great Value !

$review_text.: I am actually surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this player.  I bought this on impulse when I saw it at a Sam's Club for $39 because it would provide wireless network connectivity to one of our TVs that didn't have any network connectivity to it.  It worked just great right our of the box.  We have since replaced that TV with a projector and, even though the blu-ray player will complete the same tasks as this media player, I kept it because it indexes music and videos on our home NAS a lot faster and easier than the Panasonic DMP-BDT310 3D Blu-ray disc player.  Would I have paid $129 for it?  No.  But for $40 it is a neat gadget .
$SUMMARY.: Used for connecting to our home NAS and Netflix

$REVIEW.: I initially had given these speakers 5 stars. However, this was based on my hearing one song right after unboxing. No more. These speakers went right back to Amazon on the 5th day.This is my un-biases review, based on my experience with these and 2 other sets of speakers:Pros:1) Very sturdy construction. I like the fact that the base of the satellite speakers can be unscrewed, giving you a free speaker. My desk is full and you can place them underneath your monitor.2) Good high to mid-range sound. Not great, but clear. Great reproduction of sounds like Piano, Organ, Guitar.Cons:1) Price2) These speakers must be plugged to your computer in using a USB cable, not an audio cable. So if you spent the bucks for a high end sound card, it's now useless3) The sound control knob is very sensitive. The middle part actually contains a touch sensitive mute button. It's so sensitive that unless you're paying close attention, when you try to turn the volume, you'll inadvertently mute the speakers. When I first turned the speakers on, I thought I had gotten a DOA unit. Then I figured it out. THE KNOB IS NOT LABELED. YOU MUST READ THE MANUAL TO FIND THIS OUT4) The Bass unit is actually the main module that sends the main signal to the speakers. The cable is not as long as I'd like. The bass unit is also long, so be ready to be space challenged is you have a small working area.5) AND NOW FOR THE MAIN DEFECT: The bass coming out of this thing is slim to non existent. And don't try to use your computer's Equalizer settings to increase the bass. Bose warns you of this right on the manual. They want you to use NO EQUALIZER EFFECTS, or "you could damage the speakers". This inferior bass is non-excusable for a set of $360 speakers - Bose actually admits to this in its manual and actually tries to justify itself for the lack of bass by offending you. The line reads something like this (I'm paraphrasing, so dont take this literally: "Here at Bose, we pride ourselves in making speakers that reproduce the most realistic sound possible...bla bla bla. We don't make equipment for bass loving ignorant people. While this high bass sound may be initially attractive to the novice ear, IT IS NOT REAL." Basically what they're telling you is, our inferior sound is the real deal, and if you don't like it, you don't know what you're talking about." Now, for the record, I do NOT like excessive bass. I do, however, know that there's a certain level needed in all kinds of situations: movies, music, etc. It's supposed to complement the satellite speakers to create realism. This is exactly what Bose does with their Acoustmass modules, which I own. With these speakers, you actually forget there's a bass unit at all.Do these speakers sound good, yes. I'm not saying they sound terrible. HOWEVER, the sound they reproduce is NOT wortht he $360 price tag. I replaced them with a pair ofCambridge MicroWorks II Computer Speaker Systemand they sound AMAZING. They're $100 cheaper too. You also have theCreative GigaWorks T3 2.1 Multimedia Speaker Systemand again, they sound 10 times better at $215.Bose makes good home theater products. I have theirBose Acoustimass 10 Series IV home entertainment speaker system - Blackin my living room and I love them, so don't think this is a Bose-hating review.  I also have their Wave radio in my room and it too sounds great. But I learned the hard way that just because Bose makes some good products, that doesn't mean EVERYTHING Bose is great. You are paying for a name when it comes to these Companion 5. If these speakers would cost $150 or less, it would not be as bad. But at $359, this is a rip off.
$review_summary.: You do NOT get what you pay for - Just the name!

$review_text.: I owned a Sharper Image shower radio (the kind with suction cups that sticks to the shower wall) for years until it died on me, and thought the poor sound quality is the price you pay for a waterproof radio.  I'm so sorry I didn't buy the Sony sooner!  The sound quality is tremendous.  It isn't waterproof but I keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem.  I love the big preset selection (including local TV channels), the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own.  Great machine.

$review_text.: I had a Blackberry Curve 8310 cellphone on SquareTrade warranty that needed repair.  Everything went very smoothly. I was promptly provided with a prepaid UPS mailer via email.  SquareTrade was quick to respond on receipt of the cellphone, and make a prompt determination that it could not be repaired.  They quickly paid the full warranty value of the item and deposited it into my PayPal Account.This was my very first claim and I could not be happier with SquareTrade!  I had purchased SquareTrade warranties on three or four other items prior to making this claim.I am a satisfied customer and will continue to purchase SquareTrade warranties in the forseeable future.Be sure to retain your purchase receipts-it will make things easier for you.Note:  This review was for a warranty that cost me a fraction of the current offering-I believe that I paid less than $40.00 at that time and it apparently did not cover as many things as the current listing.

$review_text.: It's about time a game pad was made by a company that knows how to produce peripherals. Saitek has the ability, but they made the mistake of trying to copy the terribly designed, though innovative for its time, N52. You can't really blame Nostromo, since they basically had to pioneer the market and had nothing to go on, but still. Until now, gamers had to settle for awkwardly shaped units that felt as though they were constructed from actual garbage. I mean literally materials pulled from a dumpster. Yes, the Logitech is the most expensive of the major pads, and for good reason.The screen is pointless, though. There's nothing it can show that isn't better done on your monitor, at least not for actual gaming (the people who mentioned using it for MMORPG stats need to look into addons). It can do things like display system temp I think, which is cool, but not what you buy it for. You shouldn't be diverting your eyes from the screen to look at a tiny LCD above your left hand. If you really want that feature, get a G series keyboard; at least the screen is in front of you. It doesn't hurt anything, though, except for adding to the price unnecessarily. But if you're serious about gaming, you shouldn't be using a non-mechanical switch keyboard anyway.

It works, but it is annoying that it wasn't iphone4 compatible.  Well it does charge it and the transmitter does work, but you'll get an error on the iphone that the accessory isn't supported.  Follow the other guys review on how to enter international mode so that you can change the devices station to a real low one.

The unit is bulky and when curled up is a little smaller than your fist.  It takes up a lot of room in your briefcase or suitcase.  Also, the on/off button can easily be turned on when stored.  Once, when I opened my briefcase I found the light on and almost all the battery used up.  Poor design.

I'm blown away that you can get a sub like this at this price. I have heard many more expensive subs and this one can hold its own with them. While it can not get super low it gets low enough for me. We compared this sub to my buddy's HSU VTF-2 MK 3 and were amazed at how well it compared. The VTF-2 did get lower but to my ears the PSW505 sounded better (particularly with music). If you have a low budget this is the sub to get. I do not believe there is a better sub out there for under $500.

This would happen even after deselecting the phone or pad to use its internal speakers. Removing the Bluetooth from the 717 causes a complete lost and re bind of the device to device.

$review_text.: In the past, I've always used Logitech mice, but they've always developed issues after a two or three years of use.  My Logitech mouse history includes the standard three button mouse, the MX 500, the G7 and the M500.  The M500 is a corded mouse and it's still working great, but the MX 500 had charging issues and the G7's left mouse button doesn't work very well anymore.  I decided to give the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 a try and so far, it's pretty good.Installation:Installation was very easy and I didn't even need to install the Microsoft software for it.  I just plugged in the receiver stick and waited while Windows XP detected and installed drivers for a new "human interface device".Build quality:It's a solid mouse, as you would expect from Microsoft.  I find the construction comparable to that of Logitech mice.  The top part of the mouse, including the buttons, are made of a glossy plastic.  The scroll wheel seems to also be a plastic wheel with a rubbery outer cover for grip.  The sides and back of the mouse are covered in a nice, textured, rubbery material.  Overall, the construction feels very solid and seems to be of excellent quality.Ergonomics:The mouse design is symmetrical so it's good for lefties too.  The sides of the mouse are indented slightly where your thumb rests, but I find that the indents are too far forward.  Perhaps I have short thumbs, but I find that my thumb rests at the edge of the indent, rather than inside it.  This also means that I have to reach a little to press the side button, which is located directly above the indent.Coming from a right-handed ergonomic mouse, it feels like my ring and pinky fingers are just dangling on the side of the mouse.  Also, my ring finger sits right on top of the right-side button and I've accidentally clicked it a few times when picking up the mouse to reposition it.The scroll wheel doesn't click like those on most other mice.  It rotates smoothly, but there's a slight resistance that makes it's feel controlled and usable.  Logitech has an option in their newer mice that allows the wheel to spin freely if you give it a hard flick, but the resistance on this wheel makes that impossible.  I was a little worried that I wouldn't like the scroll wheel, but it actually works just fine for me when scrolling through pages of source code.Precision:The mouse tracks a little differently from my previous mouse, but it took me just a few minutes to adjust.  After getting used it, the tracking feels just as sharp as any laser mouse that I've used in the past.  I had to turn down the sensitivity a few notches when I plugged in the Wireless 5000, which might be a good sign to those who like their cursors to be extra responsive.I tried the mouse on a variety of surfaces and it worked perfectly for most of them.  It worked great on my laminate wooden desk top, a black cloth gaming mousepad, on my jeans, on the plaster wall, and on non-glare picture frame glass.  It jumped a bit when I tried it on regular picture frame glass so those with very shiny glass desks might still have a bit of trouble with this mouse.Overall, the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 is a solid buy for anyone who wants a basic, wireless mouse.  Also, mine doesn't glow blue like in the photo, but I actually prefer it like this.

$review_text.: I bought the very first Digital Rebel (300D) and loved it.  I bought the Rebel T1i and the T2i and loved them both.  I buy a new DSLR every two years whether I need it or not.  The Canon T4i is yet another great moderately priced camera that offers some performance features you would expect to find on cameras costing hundreds of dollars more.  The picture quality is among the best so far as I can tell and the new touch screen makes using the camera easier than ever.  If someone wanted to buy their first DSLR camera I would recommend this camera without hesitation or reservation.  The layout of the buttons is more intuitive that some of the other brands I have seen and the included software adds value that any user will appreciate. The new focus system on this camera is great for video.  I have shot some video using my EFS 15-85 Canon Zoom Lens and found the results as good I could have hoped to achieve.  If this is your first DSLR, I recommend buying it with the 18-135 STM lens as the versatility is unmatched for both still and video photography.Update 5/1/2013 I have been using this camera daily and it continues to amaze.  I just purchased the 18-55 IS STM lens and it works very well. It is much better than the standard kit lens.  This is the best combination for video as with the lens attached the total weight is below the 2 pound limit for most economical video stabilizers.  I also started using the in camera Handheld night scenes this will make very easy to capture holiday lighting this coming December.

$REVIEW.: The router along with it's USB cable and wall wart came packaged nicely. Having set up routers and the like before, the only thing I needed from the manual was the default IP address and login info for the admin page.The web interface offers both simple setup, and advanced admin pages for users like me that micromanage their equipment.  All of it was simple and straight forward for me.  Make no mistake, this is a fully featured router with a LOT of features that you would find in the custom DD-WRT firmware replacement for other routers.  The only thing I noticed is that it appears you may be limited to 16 static IP addresses rather than unlimited.I have the router powered only from the USB cable into a spare USB port on a desktop PC.  Uptime so far is 48 hours without a problem.  WAN, LAN and wireless all working without a problem.  Bandwidth seems to be fairly good with normal traffic.  QOS is available for bandwidth hogs that don't know how to throttle torrent speeds.I love this thing because of it's small size, config options and full feature set.  I would gladly buy this again.

$review_text.: I'm disappointed that apple doesn't increase the functionality of their keyboard to use with ios.  It is their own product, right?  i preferred getting this keyboard as a small keyboard does not work with my preferred typing speed.  But not having simple functions such as escaping out of an application or switching apps from the keyboard is just plain stupid.  And yes, I know about voice over option.  But that thing sucks for everyday use.  It isn't worth all the extra clicking and memorization when all I want is app switching.  i still prefer this keyboard over other keyboard cases options I've tried and I like that it functions with all my apple devices.

This allows digital out to the A-9050 Digital Audio Converter (DAC) through this beautiful Amp to to my Polk A7s. I had no idea they were capable of playing this quality of music. Its like I've discovered home audio all over again. With your music library in iTunes or Pandora you really don't need any other components.. just a doc station. For the money this can NOT be beat.

$REVIEW.: I'm currently safe-guarding my house because my 7 month old is crawling all over the place and I'm so nervous he'll get tangled up in all the cords behind the TV and computer desk! I was torn between buying the light-duty Velcro straps that come in packs of 100 and the heavy-duty Velcro straps that come in packs of 50 for about the same price. I eventually decided to go with quantity over quality and buy the 100 light-duty ones. They are a little flimsier than I imagined, but they definitely get the job I needed done! Most of my wires & cables are not so thick -- mostly about the thickness of a USB cable. But I can't imagine these holding the thicker cables together! If you need these for the thicker cables, I'd definitely go for the heavy-duty packs of 50 (which I assume are a lot better than these).

$REVIEW.: This review is for the TP-LINK N600 Wireless Dual Band USB Adapter, Model Tl-WDN3200 Ver 1.This USB Adapter works great. The box contains a mini-CD to install the driver (and utility if preferred), a 3.25 ft USB 2.0 cable, the instruction manual, and the USB 2.0 wireless adapter.  The driver installs in 3 minutes (if installing wireless utility also) or less.  The length of the adapter is 3.25 inches long with the USB head, and the adapter protrudes 2.75 inches when plugged into a laptop/desktop. You don't need to plug the adapter directly into the port on a laptop/desktop, but you can use the included USB cable and connect that to the adapter.So, the advantage of this adapter? The 5 Ghz. While most routers use the 2.4Ghz spectrum, some have started using the 5Ghz spectrum, and some home phone systems also use 2.4Ghz or 5 Ghz. In your current wireless network, you may have been experiencing a slowdown in speed caused by interference from other wireless devices in your house that use the same spectrum, or by your neighbors' wireless networks who are also using G or N networks. As the wireless range capabilities are increasing in the distance that a wireless signal can travel, there may be a greater chance for interference. But that's why this device can help resolve that issue by getting onto a spectrum that is different that most other devices and wireless networks.This device connected to my network at 300Mbps, while my laptop's original card was a G network card and only capable of connecting at 54Mbps. You need to understand that unless you are upgrading from A or B network speeds, you are not going to notice a difference in the download speeds of accessing the Internet and downloading files from the Internet. What you will notice a difference in speeds will be communication between devices on your own home network. If you have multiple computers sharing data in your own house, that speed will increase.  But not your internet surfing. The Internet surfing speeds also depends on whether you have an N wireless router.With this device you will experience less or no interference at all from other devices and you may be able to increase your Internet surfing speed if you were experiencing interference on your network using your old wireless network card/adapter. You will definitely see an increase in the speeds between devices on your own home network.  The adapter installs quickly, works great, it's easy to setup profiles and connect to networks, and offers all the security features you need to access your wireless network.  5 stars.

$REVIEW.: This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.

$REVIEW.: ***Find the newer version of this router on amazon for around [...]:Cisco-Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless-G Broadband Router. This older version is sold by third parties at grossly inflated prices.It's a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.I know more about networking than the average consumer, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.The Wizard is particularly sinister. It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8. These are just some of the pathetic examples.They provide no printed manual. I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website. Stupid me. It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD. But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard? No, of course not. You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.

$REVIEW.: Let me preface this with the statement that GoPro cameras are great toys, and I love using mine.  The only thing I'm less than impressed by is the interface on this model.  The company has since made major improvements in their new models, but I'm using the first gen hero.The housing itself is watertight for sure.  I was able to test it down to about 30 meters without any issues at all.  Once I figured out how to make sure the camera was actually recording, it was easy to use on dives.  You can actually still hear the beep from the camera when it starts to record and that is extremely helpful.  I was actually surprised at how audible it still was, even with all my SCUBA gear on.  Picture clarity is good to okay under water.  Using the wide angle setting you lose a bit of quality but that's true wherever you use it.  However, the quality seemed to degrade faster under water.  Use the 1080p setting for the best results.  If you plan on diving, get this housing, no question.

$review_text.: I have had this camera for 3 years now without so much as a hiccup. Every time I show my photos (and believe me, I'm a 'point and shoot' kind of guy!) people treat me like I know what I'm doing! I don't, the camera does! This camera has about 400 reviews with four and a half stars as a rating. You can count on one hand that belongs to a careless woodworker the number of products on Amazon that can sustain that kind of rating over 400 reviews. There's a reason for that! Whether by accident or design, Canon has made perhaps the best value camera in their history here. The e18 error has to be mentioned, only because it exists and it shouldn't, but the cures for this are legendary and posted all over the internet, so I don't feel it is a major concern for most people. I haven't had the problem, so I am 'shooting from the lip' here, but that is my gut reaction without having experienced it.However, if you shy away from it for this reason, so be it. Just realize that you are passing up one truly great product, and these days that is a lot rarer than hen's teeth!

$REVIEW.: Most of my TV watching is movies that I stream from my PC to my DVD player via Serviio

I had an earlier model Sony Blu-ray (an S390, at the same price point) that supported all formats and subtitles, but, after a year, developed a weird stuttering problem

I got this as a replacement, and it's a huge disappointment, because .srt subtitle files are no longer supported

Sony has acknowledged this as a &#34;feature&#34; -- i.e., there's nothing wrong with my player -- they simply downgraded the capabilities of the machine
Also, the S390 had analog audio outputs; this one does not
I can live without the analog audio, but not without subtitle support.

$review_text.: I purchased the Seasonic SS-1250XM PSU for my second rig because it's running two GTX 780s in SLI (both overclocked) and I might even add a third one later so I need the best PSU that's out there. Since Seasonic makes the best PSUs in this industry, I decided to get the best PSU they make, the Seasonic SS-1250XM. I have had some old PSUs blow up on me so I went overbuild by purchasing this PSU, but I would rather be safe than sorry. I have seen PSUs blow up from left and right and kill all the components in the computer which is why I wanted something that was reliable and durable.The Seasonic SS-1250XM really feels like a premium PSU when holding it and the materials used to make it really make the PSU stand out from the rest of the PSUs that's out there. It feels very well polished and it has a nice clean design that's not cluttered like the rest of the PSUs I have bought. There are plenty of cables in the box that are packaged quite well. The cables are bundled in a case in the same gold and black motif in which the power supply itself is dressed. I can't hear the fan spinning at all when gaming and even under full load using Prime95 which says a lot about the quality of the PSU. There are so many cables and slots that you can use and I doubt I will ever need more than just a few.Obviously you are paying a premium for this power supply and you are definitely getting something that's worth every penny you spent. I am more than satisfied with it. Some people compare this to the Corsair AX1200 and even say that the Corsair one is better but they forget that the Corsair AX1200 is partially made by Seasonic so there you go. Seasonic SS-1250XM is a much better quality PSU than the Corsair AX1200 and is made by the best PSU manufacture in the world. I'm planning on buying another one for my friend because he wants to build a high end gaming rig so I recommended him to get this one and I'm sure he'll be impressed. I always trust Seasonic when buying a PSU and I always recommend it all of my enthusiast friends that build computers almost on a weekly basis. I have always had a good experience with the PSUs that Seasonic makes. I can't recommend this product enough times. All cables are long and sleeved very well.Seasonic is known for making very reliable and durable PSUs and the Seasonic SS-1250XM is no exception. The installation process is pretty straight forward and you don't need me to explain how to install it because most of us who purchase these kind of things are geeks and we know how stuff works. Another thing that I love about this PSU is that it runs super cool and is whisper quiet. My old PSUs used to make loud noises but this one is inaudible just like my EVGA SuperNOVA 1000W. I have had many PSUs shut down on me while playing games because they would overheat but this one handles everything like a champ.The Seasonic SS-1250XM is an extremely well built PSU and Seasonic has used very high quality materials that really show when you hold the PSU in hand. It is fully modular and has 8 PCIe connectors but you can either run two 8 pin CPU connectors or 4 PCIe connectors but not both. It has great sleeved cables that are nice and long and it's gold certified. The warranty is 5 years which is always nice because you never know what might happen in the future. I have had many products die on me a few days after the warranty expires and it's the worst thing that can happen. Seasonic's customer service is outstanding and they have always been very nice to me.Pros:+Can even power a jet engine :D+High amperage for even the most power hungry GPUs+Single 12V rail+Amazing build quality+80 PLUS GOLD Certified+Clean design+Dead silent+8 PCIe connectors+Fully modular+Great Packaging+From Seasonic+5 years warrantyCons:-NoneOverall, the Seasonic SS-1250XM is the best PSU your money can buy and it's worth every penny if you ask me. You can even power the most power hungry GPUs that's out there and it still has power left to power a jet engine.  If you are looking for something that's reliable and future-proof then the Seasonic SS-1250XM is the PSU you should purchase. The packaging is absolutely insane, it's almost unreal. When holding the PSU, you can really feel the high quality materials that Seasonic used to make this amazing PSU.I have been building and fixing computers for as long as I can remember and I have never come across a PSU that feels this high quality like the Seasonic SS-1250XM. I easily give it a 10/10 for the sturdiness, single 12V rail, fully modular, clean design and super quiet. I strongly recommend this PSU to all the enthusiasts who want the best the money can buy and you can never go wrong with Seasonic because they have an amazing customer service!My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K @ 4.6GhzPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit

$review_text.: The Beyerdynamic DT 770's are the perfect headphone for work. They are sealed well to leak little sound out, you will not disturb your neighbor at reasonable volumes. The large comfortable pads also help seal environmental noise out, even with no music outside sounds are decreased by about 20-30%. Build quality is fantastic: the cable is firmly attached, headband seems to flex well, cans seem firm and tight with no moving pieces.These are not the most picky headphones as far as connection is concerned, they do well un-amped, even from most portable devices; although battery drain is noticeable over ear buds. Amping these makes them really shine and even a cheaper amp make them sound great. Source is important considering these are extremely accurate, junk in == junk out.Sound quality is outstanding for every type of music I throw at it (Classical, Jazz, Rock, Rap), just make sure your ears are in about the center of the can as too far forward is bass city and too far back is treble town. Definition and Clarity are as good as Sennheiser 600s, if not slightly better. You can hear fingers move up and down strings, and vocals are clear but not over accented, percussion truly shine. The general sound is warm but not so soft that things start blending together. These are my favorite headphones that I own and would recommend them to anyone.

$REVIEW.: Wrong connector design at enclosure's side (miniUSB3).Don't trust critical data to this enclosure.Get a better one (even if slightly more money).A few other problems + only ONE plus: Details below:===Connector is not recessed into enclosure & breaks off easily; I am a professional w/decades of computer work and can testify connector is junk.Enclosure is extremely slim/portable & cheap - that's the only Pro.Also:Firmware chip is one of the early USB3's, may cause signaling violations coupled w/cable falling out from enclosure at the slightest pressure, even by itself!Cable ridiculously stiff for a 2.5" enclosure, stiffer than in my desktop USB3 enclosure.  Like metal rod, could be no big deal but point is - connector being a problem compounded by stiff cable ==> together form a deadly combination that finally killed my Harddrive full of workdata, after 2 months.Wasn't happy that day.Suppose Connectaland (CL) updates this model w/softer cable & newer firmware (my Review is dated :), but reworking Connector would call for a new model#, this one is bad, however.  CL has no choice actually if Slimness is the goal.Spend a little more money & maybe it would be slightly thicker - but get better enclosure, like MASSCOOL for 2.5" & VANTEC for 3.5" drives, etc.  I got both after losing a harddrive due to Connectaland (CL), e.g. MASSCOOL 2.5" is using normal-sized USB3 port at Enclosure's side - penalty in thickness is negligible, but reliability is priceless (connector cannot fall out)!  Moreover, this CL's electronics board (PCB) is there permanently, but you can pull out Masscool's board and attach even to a desktop (3.5") drive or another application (extra flexibility/value).I guess you will want this CL if you can somehow assure it's perfectly "fixed" unmoved during use or if you don't value your data, and just need max. portability - it's as slim as harddisk itself (thoough also implies little protection).But to me, the "END" was when CL finally killed a Harddrive.  Note: ever since I got a new enclosure, and it's been a LONG TIME ( I edited this Reveiw approx 1 year after Connectaland let me down), it's been perfect, AND I've read since then numerous other people saying the same thing:Connector is a trouble spot here (combined w/crazy stiff cable, compunds the problem).What happens (and happened to me) is when your Harddrive/SSD is Writing, connector may quietly snap out, you have a "good" chance you end up with damaged Harddrive heads/clusters/whatever - Harddrive is lost.  If it's movies & music, fine, in my case was valuable workdata - not fine!My other point, is other enclosures I mentioned above, cost not just same but some even cheaper, I understand better ==> often more expensive, but in this case it's opposite, I got a cheaper yet better enclosure that even included a screwdriver, amazing :)  Also those are all painted black, not silver or fingerprint magnet like the "mirror finish" of Connectaland.Using Krazy-Glue to glue cable to connector defies the purpose of portability - you won't believe how STIFF & LONG cable suopplied by Connectaland is , so "portable" enclosure would turn into a monster.Last thing: blue LED is one of those "superbright" types found on electronics made until recenttimes, when manufacturers thought brighter is better, until they invented this LED that can actually hurt your eyes at night.  One night I taped it, and you would too.  It's a flashlight, what in the world is the reason to make "Indicator" light as powerful as a flashlight?  I lit whole apartment with this thing, but admittedly it attracts teenagers in stores maybe.  Also this thing looks slim & sleek, except no good for its main function which is Harddrive enclosure.  Not a jewelry object :)Look:I have one normal 2-color LED on MASSCOOL enclosure which changes color from Green to Red when writing, elegant & simple.  Not obnoxious.  Besides the fact that USB3 connector is proper and been working for about a year perfect!The biggest plus of this Connectaland is Slimness and that's it.

$REVIEW.: I bought this product, since I had the problem of wiring my entire house in order to share an cable internet connection between 3 computers.I read more than 10 reviews for Wireless Routers and found that NetGear was the best buy.  I went to review D-Link Wireless Products as well as Linksys, but between these three mayor companies, I decided to go with NetGear.  It gives you all the features which they claim it has (routing protocols, application support, smart wizard to automatically detect ISP type, Port Rage Forwarding, URL content filtering, etc. etc.).Regarding the security, it comes with the option to enable WEP Encryption from 64 to 128 bit encryption as well as other security features.  According to many reviews, some people have been having the problem that the wireless network drops every time.  I connected two computers trough the 4 Ethernet ports and one computer using the MA311 Wireless PCI Adapter.  This computer is more than 100ft away from the router.  The signal must pass more than four walls with an angle of 90 degrees in corners, which makes the walls thicker.  I haven't lost the connection ever since I connected the entire network in my home.  The signal strength is at its 80% performance as well as the link quality, and I am receiving full 11Mbps.In conclusion, the NetGear MR814 gives you a great performance, excellent signal length and security.  I recommend this product for home use, since it is easy to install and for the price it gives you an excellent value for your money.

Setup was easy.One minor problem is that my TV does not have A/V in (Component only) so my only option was HDMI. That's fine since I wanted to do HDMI anyways but unfortunately it doesn't come with an HDMI cord.FYI, I bought this for about $40. I may consider paying $50.Oh, and it's nice to browse the other services to see what they have to offer.

$REVIEW.: This  splitter did not do what I needed


 Maybe it is my fault
 I should have ordered a HDMI switch I guess


 Wanted to be able to  run the TV or the Blu Ray Player
 You can not have both plugged into the splitter at the same time


 Neither one will work when both are plugged in

 I have a older TV that has only one HDMI receptacle and I thought that I could feed both  receiver for TV and Blu Ray Player into the splitter and then into the TV

 The splitter does not work that way


 Still will use the splitter because it gives me a better condition to get at the back of TV
 But must have only one cable plugged into it


 You plug in the cable from either the receiver or the Blu Ray Player depending on what you are watching and unplug the other.

$REVIEW.: I was planning to use this antenna as an upgrade from another Antennas Direct UHF antenna, the DB8:Antennas Direct DB8 Multidirectional HDTV AntennaAccording to the specs the 91XG should have had significantly better distance reception and be more directional
The UHF stations I wanted are all mounted on the John Hancock building in Chicago


The antenna was snapped together exactly as described in the instruction sheet
The balun was OK and reception was OK with the 91XG.I was surprised when in side by side swap-out tests the DB8 8-bay UHF got better reception and signal strength numbers at the receiver than the 91XG
Note that this was in an attic above the 2nd floor of a house with a pretty clear ~50 mile line of sight to Chicago

The antennas were on the other side of a 1920s wood frame with a solid brick veneer.I used the same cable (RG6U) feeding directly to the TV and the antennas took turns at the same spot in the attic aimed at the tower site
Not a perfect scientific test, but still reasonable
Since the antennas were planned to be installed on the roof in the spring the added wind load of the 91XG meant there was nothing it its favor.

$REVIEW.: Alright, I've got to say... this is perhaps the best camera that I've ever owned. A major step up from my first digital camera (a Mustek VDC-3500-which I'd highly recommend against), and even better than my Sony DCR-TRV130 Digital8 Camcorder (which isn't focused on taking photographs anyway), the Olympus D-360L is a dream come true. From the 1.8" LCD screen to the sixty-four (64) megabyte (no, that's not a typo; the D-360L that I bought came packaged with a 64Mb SmartMedia chip in addition to the 8Mb chip packaged originally with the camera ... The photo quality of images taken with the camera is hardly anything to scoff at, and if you've got advanced image-editing software (i.e., Adobe Photoshop), then you can make an excellent image look even better!The only downside that I've managed to find to the camera, is the same problem that countless others have pointed out: the low battery life. But, as people have recommended, this problem can be overcome with nothing more than either a large pack of AA batteries, or just by buying a dozen or so rechargeable batteries and switching out between them. There are additional quirks that I've got against the camera, but nothing that can't be overcome by spending a couple dollars or so. First, it's the fact that the D-360L camera uses a serial connection for uploading images to your computer. This means that you're in for somewhat of a wait, unless you buy a SmartMedia memory reader. But no worries! You can buy an extremely affordable SmartMedia reader ...for [very little]! ... When I plugged the SmartMedia reader into my computer, it immediately picked up on what it was, and installed the drivers automatically, without any necessary disc (although a drivers disc does come with the reader), as I'm running the Windows 2000 Professional operating system. But what I found to be the most interesting thing about the reader is this: it doesn't transfer the images through a TWAIN interface, but instead, shows up as a drive in My Computer, where you can just copy, paste, and delete the file(s) right there! Now isn't that convenient?As a matter of fact, if you're a Mac user, I'd really recommend that you purchase a SmartMedia reader, because it's only an added twenty dollars, and the investment is well worth it in the long run. ... In addition to rechargeable batteries and the SmartMedia reader though, I'd recommend that you also purchase an AC adapter for the camera to save battery-life while you're transferring the images (this is of course, unnecessary if you purchase a SmartMedia reader).All in all, I'd say that the Olympus D-360L digital camera was the best [money] that I've ever spent on a computer-related gadget, and I know that, if you can see past it's few (small) flaws, you'll really love this, as it's a great product, entrance level or not. My final verdict is five out of five for the camera, and I'd encourage EVERYONE to buy one of these.Here's a bit of an update (August 04, 2002).  Recently, I went on vacation with my dad to Philadelphia.  Well, I went to visit Hershey Park to check out the Dolphin show, starring Clovis and Wee Tee.  The show was excellent, albeit rather short&#65533;weighing in at fifteen minutes, plus fifteen minutes of sea lions.  In any event, I took a LOT of pictures while I was there, and I began to notice that the camera was a bit slow with taking the pictures.  It took around perhaps two to three seconds to process each image in high-quality mode.  Although it might not seem like a lot of time in between pictures, it's an aeon, when your subjects are fast-paced Dolphins!  However, even though there is this little problem that I have with it, my review still holds at five stars.

(this is not shown in any of the pictures) The adapter will not work unless the drive jumpers are set for single "master" drive. Then it works flawlessly. (will not work on cable or slave settings.) Excellent product. I have not used the CD that comes with it, and maybe that is where the instructions are, but except for the fact that the drive has to be set to master, the rest is obvious.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to use with a new "dumb" HDTV after trying a "smart" TV (an LG 5700LS series) that had a built in browser.  The LG browser interface was awful, leaving the potential of Internet-connected TV glimmering beyond reach.  So it was either try the Sony Google TV box or go back in time to the 20th century.There are a lot of unhappy reviews of Google TV on this site but I'm a near-geek, so I gave it a try.  It works!  It's a reasonably integrated TV-Internet experience, and it's a big step beyond a "Smart TV".  I paired it with a new but "dumb" Samsung HDTV.  Buy the Sony box if you want to access the Internet from your TV and if you have (1) a reasonably fast internet connection; (2) an HDTV with an HDMI input; (3) if you're willing to follow the setup directions blindly and (4) if you can put up with some inconsistencies in the interface.The initial setup took about 45 minutes from the time I opened the package.  When the Sony box is positioned and everything is plugged in, you turn it on and finds your Internet connection (wired or Wi-Fi).  If you use Wi-Fi and your router is password protected (and it should be!) you will need to enter the password to complete the connection.  If you use a wired connection, it's live as soon as you plug in the LAN (Ethernet) cable.  Once the connection is found, the Sony looks for the latest version of Google TV software, downloads and installs it, and reboots.  That process took about 20 minutes.  The initial setup also leads you through a process to zoom the picture to your TV, and it gives you a few options. One option keeps the Sony Google TV on standby when the system is off, so it doesn't have to fully reboot when you want to use it.  Since there's an Intel Atom computer inside, a full reboot will take almost a minute, so using the standby option is the way to go. Even on standby, it takes about 5 - 10 seconds to resume when you turn on the TV.The Sony comes with a remote controller that replaces the remotes for your TV, DVD, cable box and AV receiver.  (Your remotes will still work, but you need the Sony for Google TV features and you can use it for everything else.)  The first time you turn on the Sony box, the controller "pairs" automatically with the box.  There's a little fiber optic line that plugs into the back of the Sony box, and at the other end there's a seed-sized glass dome that has to be placed near the IR receiver on your TV - the one you point at with your TV remote.  That allows the Sony box to send an IR signal to control the TV's on/off, channel and volume controls.  The controller works even if you block the line of sight to the Sony box, so it must use RF rather than infrared.The following description of the controller makes it sound more complex than it is in practice.The controller has a QWERTY keyboard the size of the one on a Blackberry, plus 25 other buttons related to TV, Internet search, and DVD player functions.  There's an Fn (function) key that gives you access to some additional functions.  There's a button in the upper right corner that acts like a mouse pad and lets you move a cursor around freely.  Press the button to do a mouse click, sort of like tapping the mouse pad on a laptop.  The mouse button is surrounded by four buttons that have other functions.  In the upper left corner, there's a four-way controller like the ones on a digital camera, with and Enter button in the center and four arrow keys that jump the cursor from one field to the next on the screen, so you can go up or down a list.  On the front (facing the TV) there are zoom and scroll keys that you access by holding down the Enter button on the four-way controller.Sounds complex... and it is, at first.  But if you use a mouse pad on a laptop and have a digital camera, you'll get the hang of it. The keys are small and the whole device feels toy-like and not very robust.  If you have big thumbs it will be hard to use.  For another $99 you can buy a slightly larger and more robust "Logitech Mini-Controller for Google TV" (not to be confused with the Logitech Revue).  But it would be nice if Sony beefed up the one included with the NSZ-GT1.  Sony offers a free app in the Apple iTunes store that turns your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch into a pretty good replacement for the controller.  When you download it, if your iAnything's Wi-Fi connection is on, it finds the Sony even if the Sony box is plugged into a LAN.  (That was a surprise.  How does it do that without being logged onto the house Wi-Fi router?)  Open the app and select the Sony Google TV box to register your iAnything.  There may be a similar app in the Android Market as well; not sure about that.  On an iPhone, you can switch easily between a touch-sensitive cursor pointer, a keyboard, and arrow keys, among other things.  It may be easier for some people to use than the Sony remote controllerSometimes, there's a couple of seconds' lag between pressing Enter and getting a response, and the Chrome browser is slower than the one on my PC, probably because of the less powerful Intel Atom processor inside the Sony.  But most of the quirks relate to the controller itself:  There are (at least) three ways to press Enter.  One is a key labeled "Enter" where you would expect it to be on the keypad.  The second is the Enter button on the four-way controller in the upper left corner.  The third is the unlabeled button in the middle of the mouse controller.  When you use the included Netflix app, none of them will take you past your log-in password.  Put in your user name and password and you're seemingly stuck.  To get to the next step, you have to press the Tab key.  Go figure. Based on what I've read about Google TV, these inconsistencies are common for Android apps.  I'm an iPhone/iPad user so I'm used to a rigidly consistent app interface.  The controller's button that moves the cursor freely is easy to point with reasonable but not perfect precision, but the Zoom and Scroll functions that use the same pointer button are very jerky.Once you get used to the controller's quirks, you can explore the potential of Google TV.  Most notably, you can get to the Internet - the real Internet, not a walled garden boxed in by the TV set's manufacturer.  The Sony uses Goggle's Chrome browser, which I happen to use on my PCs.  It allows you to search, browse or log into Amazon and download streaming video, which runs flawlessly on my cable Internet service.  (There's also a built-in Netflix application.)  You can search Google while watching a TV show (or any video content) by popping the video into a small box using the PIP button and then opening a search screen.  Or you can push the dedicated Search key on the controller and go directly to the search box, which leaves the audio from the TV show or movie playing in the background.  You can also buy apps from the Android Market and access YouTube directly from a dedicated icon on the Home screen, set a list of favorite channels, etc.Conclusion thus far: Lots of "Smart TV" functionality; reasonably good convergence between the TV and the Internet, and somewhat quirky user interface, but not to the point where it gets in the way of enjoyment. And far better for getting to the Internet than a "Smart TV".  Four stars; it would be five stars if the remote controller was more robust and there were fewer quirks.

Protects the ipad 3 well, feels very sturdy, and can be propped up in two ways

This is good because my mom watches a lot of Korean drama

Another cool thing is that the ipad display turns on when you flip the cover open, and turns off when you close it
I guess it detects light levels or something

But that feature potentially goes for all ipad cases.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this case for a Canon ELPH 330HS. This is the recommended case according to the Canon website. Initially, the case seemed a fraction too tight, and the magnetic clasp didn't catch. However, the ballistic-nylon and leather from which the case is fabricated stretches a bit with use. After a dozen insertions, more or less, the camera now slides in quite easily, and the magnetic clasp closes properly. My wife likes this case because it is compact and doesn't take up a lot of space in her purse.

$review_text.: First a very big Thank You to R.L. Frank for his/her insightful and extremely helpful review.  Without his/her information regarding the necessary driver for Windows 7, I would have passed on this board...Board arrived quickly (as usual with Amazon) and was physically easy to install.  The enclosed information from Diamond is almost useless but if you're installing your own system cards and tweaking your BIOS settings, I have to believe you really don't need much hand holding.  As stated by others, there are no drivers listed on the Diamond site for Windows 7 but you can simply follow R.L. Franks directions OR let Windows 7 direct you.  I downloaded the RC driver from the C Media site prior to receiving the board and installed from that download however, when first booting up the computer after physically installing the board, Windows 7 tried to install drivers from its on board library and finding none for this card, promptly found the C Media site driver and posted directions on how to obtain the proper driver - including a site to obtain the necessary decompression program.  Now that was impressive!Board itself works very nicely and has excellent sound.  Nice board for the price. I only gave it 4 stars because Diamond is so far behind the driver curve forcing customers to jump through additional hoops.  Poor customer support...

$review_text.: UPDATE: Jan 1 2014I have had this DVD player freeze on me a couple of times since I purchased it a few months ago.  When it freezes, the remote doesn't function and you cannot restart it simply by pressing the power on/off button.  You have to physically get up and unplug the DVD play.  There is someone in my household who is disabled and bed ridden.  Its extremely annoying for them to have to call someone to unplug the DVD player in order to continue using it.  Although this has only happened two or three times, I am dropping the rating to 4 stars.Set up:This product was extremely easy to set up on my wifi network.  The signal strength was strong and would catch several different networks over 150 feet away.You will need to do a firmware update which would take about 10 minutes to download and then reboot.  Once you complete the update, you'll have access to netflix, hulu, amazon prime videos, crackle and more.  You can begin watching movies and shows for free using youtube and crackle.3D:this player can play your 3D blueray discs.  I have not tested this feature yet and may update my review when I do.On Screen Keyboard:The player comes with an on screen full keyboard which is very easy to navigate using the 4 arrows on the remote control.  This is an upgrade from previous models and makes searching for movies online much easier and more intuitive.

$review_text.: 3 Year Update:Still going strong. While it's falling behind on the HD resolution compared to new TVs, it is fine for watching TV programs and standard DVDs. Great for Comcast OnDemand programs, too. No breakdowns of any kind. Highly reliable and built like a tank. Will probably end up in a bedroom soon for many more years of service.Prior Review:I've seen a lot of bad reviews here. I may have been fortunate, or others just got part of a bad batch. Not a single problem in over 18 months. Works like a dream. And I paid 350.00 including shipping in '05. Not a refurb, either.The only significant complaint I have is that it is a 15:9 aspect ratio. The top and botton are slightly cropped. It's only a problem when a sports event displays stats very high or very low on the picture, such as with some football games. It can get cut off a bit then. Another minor complaint is that it has a 1-second pause when switching inputs. If I need to go from the input 1 source to the input 4 source, it seems to take a long time to get through the inputs.Positives: Outstanding for DVD movies. Great picture with analog cable. You just can't beat a tube. No artifacts like you get with a plasma or LCD.Remote is very good, and the set works automatically with my cable remote.It is very heavy, but it's a welcome change from some of the paper thin plastic electronics gear I'm seeing a lot of lately. Everything in electronics seems so flimsy now, it's nice to have a tank sometimes. Once you put it in place, why would you need to move it?

$review_text.: I was asked to do this review by Amazon because of my Top Reviewer status.And after reading a great deal of hype with this gadget, it was time to give it a try. My reviews are known for being short and to the point, so here it goes:-the grippy rubber holds a 77mm cap plus a spare battery for a 50D SECURELY-it's MUCH smaller than I thought, even though the photos show it's only about 100mm long-echoing what other reviewers have said, it DOESN'T fit aftermarket wide straps-on my 50D strap, it sits very close to the camera itself because of the width issue, and gets in the way. I got somewhat used to it, and so will you, but you won't FORGET it's there.Bottom Line:You'll never lose your cap again because you'll be reminded where it is every shot.  :-)

$REVIEW.: The Philips Fidelio DS1100 Speaker Dock is specifically made for the bedroom.  It is compact with a round design, has a clock, and fits well on my night table.  It sounds full and clear with speakers that have shielding technology.  It is compatible with the iphone and most ipods, including the itouch.  When I docked my 4th generation Nano, it immediately displayed the correct time.  I even left the case on the Nano, and it fit well.  The dock has a night light with dimmer that is adjustable by pressing the spot on the front. There are two playback controls for sound, one on the top of each side, which you can control by pressing the plus or minus. It shows the current setting with lighted numbers on the front of the dock.  There is a USB port on rear for another mobile device.If you have an iphone,you can download a dedicated application for multiple alarms.  I went for a week withhout docking my ipod, and the clock lost about 2 minutes.  It reset itself to the current time when I docked the ipod again.  I really like the features of this little dock and use it mainly for listening to audiobooks in bed, and music sounds really good through the omni-directional speakers.  Great little dock.

$review_text.: As of the end of May 2013, the Sony 32 GB SDHC R40 is on sale for under $20, so the card is a bargain in light of its reasonable performance specifications.  Note however that to maximize the performance of this card, your host device must be UHS-1 compatible, which means many older devices will find this card to be a poor performer.  In newer devices, this is a good card-reasonably fast, waterproof, and with recovery software (if needed) available for download.After receiving this card, I tested it against a bunch of other SD cards in my personal inventory.  Note that there is some room for error (due to hand/stopwatch reaction time).  Nevertheless, it's a good relative overview.  I tested using a UHS-1 capable reader and files of known size.  Here's a summary of the results:Sandisk Extreme SDHC (45 MB/sec label)READ:  44.9 MB/sec (with bursts above 50 MB/sec)WRITE: 34.32 MB/secSony 32GB SDHC UHS-1 R40 (the card being reviewed here)READ:  39.61 MB/sec (with significant initial burst of over 100 MB/sec)WRITE: 19.07 MB/secPNY "Professional" 16GB, (20 MB/sec label)READ:  14.78 MB/secWRITE: 20.74 MB/secPatriot LX Class 10 16GB memory card (from Fry's Electronics)READ: 11.15 MB/secWRITE: 19.79 MB/secSandisk Ultra, with UHS-1 labelREAD:  36.76 MB/secWRITE: 10.67 MB/secAnd just for fun--here's what a number looks like for an older compact flash with UDMA controller:Sandisk Extreme IV 4 GB compact flashREAD: Not testedWRITE: 33 MB/secSo, as you can see, while this Sony card is not the fastest performing card out there, it's performance is still quite good in the latest gear.  Also, a quick word about video and transfer rates.  Digital video is recorded in "megaBITS" per second, while these cards are speed rated in "megaBYTES" per second.  That makes it a bit confusing.  At the moment, digital SLRs from the factory are at about 24 up to 100 megabits/second in terms of their video rate.  To convert bits to bytes, divide by 8...so that becomes 3 MB/sec to 12.5 MB/second.  For most digital SLRs out there, even the Sandisk Ultra is fast enough for video, but if your camera has a high bitrate option, this Sony has enough headroom for sustained file writing.  The Sandisks are still king of the mountain, but they do cost more.  Sandisk has long underrated their higher end cards; even older Sandisks are often faster than newer cards from other makers (like the older compact flash example above).  If you absolutely need the higher performance, go with the Sandisk Extreme or Extreme Pro, but you'll pay for it.  From my own numbers, I'm comfortable with the Sony for day to day use for my D800.  If I really need speed though, I'm going with compact flash over SDHC.

$REVIEW.: I bought my G6 in December, borrowed a Canon 420 EX speedlite and liked the results but I wondered if the smaller, lighter, less expensive 220 EX would be good enough?  Some of the reviews here say it is underpowered.  Is it?  I bought one to find out and took both out into my backyard in 8 PM darkness to try them at 5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet and 40 feet on the G6.Conclusion #1:  The G6 has a good builtin flash.  It makes good images within it's limited range of 5 meters/16 feet (or 4 meters/13 feet when the lens is set to telephoto) and works well as a fill flash.  Complete failure beyond 20 feet.Conclusion #2:  The 420EX (range 24.2 meters) and the 220EX (range 15.7 meters/51.5 feet) both make better images than the builtin flash and both offer longer range.  But both are limited by the autofocus range of 5 to 7 meters.  That's right, neither flash can focus on a subject more than 20 feet away in darkness with the lens set to telephoto.  Both worked fine when the lens was set to wide angle at 40 feet.Final Conclusion:  I'm keeping the 220 EX.  The G6 is small and light, so is the 220EX.  They make a good team, but the G6 also does well alone up close.

$REVIEW.: The Garmin nuvi 1490LMT is great because it is exactly what you expect to be.  It has  a sensitive GPS receiver and can be set up so the display suits your preferences.This is my first auto GPS but I have been using hand helds for years.  I have no basis for comparison with other brands.  However I can say the interface is intuitive and easy to use.  I like being able to use the touch screen to point to a location on the map for navigation rather than having to enter an address.I use the bluetooth with my phone and this feature was easy to set up and works well too.The only thing I would change is to add a means to hard wire the power.  The plug to the auto 12VDC source is big and clunky because it also contains the fuse.  It would be much better if Garmin either supplied or sold a kit to hard wire the GPS power directly to the vehicle's 12VDC.

$REVIEW.: Sony XB500's are the best pair of headphones I have ever used

The bass is amazing! It's really a great pair of headphones for any kind of song you are listening to.Sound: If you love a deep bass, these are for you


These headphones do come with bass vibrations which I like, but they work well for any song
The minute I listened to music with these, I was blown away! It definitely exceeded my expectations

They are exceptional for Dubstep, Hip-hop, etc.Durability: While the earcups are not made of plastic, the rest of the build is
But not the cheap kind of plastic

These pair of headphones have been through a lot of rowdy use and it still works perfectly, so don't be misled.Comfort: These headphones come with squishy, soft earpads
They are very comfortable and don't irritate your ears like some hard-plastic headphones too


You can wear them for extended amounts of time and not be irritated.Sound-cancelling: You will hear some ambience with these headphones because they are not made specifically for noise-cancelling
But I think they do a decent job at it

Of course, if you want no interruptions in your music, you should wear them in quieter areas.Durable - 10/10Comfort - 10/10Sound - 10/10Sound-Cancelling - 8/10For an excellent pair of headphones, the price is perfect

I wouldn't mind paying more for these though!

I am also looking for something compact and not as heavy as my previous ones
I already own 2 that are heavy, cumbersome and surrounded by aluminum heatsinks with sharp corners in every direction
They also need additional wires to plug to your car cigarette lighter outlet which is annoying


Now that I got this, I have been using it for several days - so far, so good.I can hear the fan noise when it is plugged, but not as loud as my other power inverters


If I plug it in front of my Accord, the unit is very close to my shift gear, but the thing is, I can rotate it and swivel it to one side, which is nice.Pros:- Has all that I need, AC outlet and USB port (1 each)- Compact for portability- Comes with 2 USB cables - 1 standard and one microCons:- Pugly


Devoid of any aesthetic charms.- Swivel neck is suffering from a stiff neck

I thought I was breaking its neck when I turned it- Cheap looks, like Dolly Parton.

$review_text.: The built-in stand of this cover works great


 I eat while reading without holding my kindle, prop it on my lap while sitting in a chair, etc
 It protects the Kindle well, and is simple to put the Kindle in.Cons:- When the cover folds back flat, it doesn't want to stay there and it's not very comfortable to hold it that way for a long time.- The part that surrounds the keyboard makes it difficult to use the spacebar frequently

 Not an issue for occasional Kindle store purchase, but I notice a lot when playing the available word games that use spacebar as a frequent shortcut

 I find myself pulling the Kindle out of the case when playing games.As another reviewer noted, the pink being shipped is a much more vivid pink, not the pastel color shown here
 I love the color and ordered it after having read that other review.

$review_text.: I obtained this for a new home theater setup in my family room and have been immensely pleased with the quality of the receiver. My setup is not in a dedicated home theater room, so there is the usual family room furniture to break up the sound space.Although I am very pleased with the receiver, I gave it a 4/5 rating for 3 reasons:1. I liked the idea of the self-adjusting speaker balance function using the included microphone setup, but I could never get it sense all my speakers in the 3 setup positions it recommends, so I found this function useless in my situation. I just manually adjusted the speakers in my 5.1 setup and things sound great.2. It has a very steep learning curve, but when through with the speaker and component setup and connection, it works magnificently with the included remote as well as a Logitech Harmony 880. (I doubt though that it is any more difficult setup that other AV receivers.)3. The remote is NOT a universal remote, although it is sort of billed as one. There were no codes for my new Samsung HDTV or the Toshiba HD-A2. We got a Harmony 880 and this has served as a good entry level universal remote and worked well with the Onkyo.Having said all this, I am very pleased with the quality of sound and the simplicity of managing mulitile components through the AV receiver. The 2 HDMI inputs work well with our DirecTV input and Toshiba HD-DVD player input. (I'll have to get an HDMI switch if I get a BluRay player.) Overall it is a great product for the price.

$review_text.: Great Price and works exactly as I needed it too.I bought this device in order to share a single mouse, monitor and keyboard between my Windows 7 PC and an Apple Mac Mini. The connectivity is supper easy and all functions including the ability to share a single set of PC speakers works as intended. This device switches between systems using a double-tap of the Scroll Lock key on your keyboard, which makes switching between systems supper easy and convenient. I can see how some might also want a hardware switch, but quite frankly this works so well, I don't miss it. Besides, a hardware switch means having to keep the KVM switch close at hand, which would be an eyesore in my mind.

$REVIEW.: I'm disappointed with the item I recieved considering all the glowing reviews. Maybe it's just a manufacturing fluke, but this case is too small for my Kindle Touch. When empty the it looks very nice and seems a good bargain for the price I paid. But, with the Kindle Touch inside, the case stretches at the corners, causing the material framing the screen to bow outward and the corners of the back cover to bend inward. The result looks cheap and ugly. I am pleased with Amazon's convenient return policy and will be making use of it.

$review_text.: These are pretty good bluetooth headphones. They excel with regard to comfort - the ear padding is plush and they have a nice balance between grip (e.g., staying put when you move) and comfort. The headband consists of 2 plastic rods without any padding, but doesn't cause a significant comfort issue.I had zero problems pairing these with a couple of different tablets (Android operating system and the Fire version of Android). Simple, quick and painless. The operating range is also excellent, with zero dropouts at about 20 feet and only minor dropouts at 25+ feet.The sound quality is quite good. While these open-ear designs don't have the booming bass quality of closed designs, I found the sound quality to be very good, especially in the midrange. They are an excellent choice for movie watching since the dialogue comes through so clearly.I like the operating controls, especially the volume switch. It's a rocker-type design, so it's very easy to use without having to look at the button - just find it by feel, and press up to increase volume and down to decrease. The multifunction button is in the middle of the rocker switch and is very easy to find by touch as well.The overall look is very snazzy, and the build quality appears solid.There is only a modest amount of sound isolation, but that again is an issue inherent with open-ear headphones. It does cut ambient sound reasonably well - I had no problems listening to music while on a noisy treadmill without the ambient sound interfering to any significant degree.Misses are the volume level. These have a rather limited upper volume range. Normally I set my tablet to about the 75% level and the headphone level to close to the upper point to get a good volume that blocks out ambient noise. With these, however, I had to set the tablet sound level to 100% and the earphone level also at 100%, and I still found them a bit lacking in volume. Given the price point, the range should be better.But other than the volume issue, no complaints. Good sound, good comfort, great range and easy-to-use controls. Well worth considering.[Sample provided for review]
$SUMMARY.: Very comfortable, good sound quality, bit light on volume

I filled it with 100 GB so far

Now I can browse any one and watch it on any TV anywhere
It works perfect


I have to admit though the quality is not as good as the DVD

However it is not bad at all


So if you have large files to store this one is for you

I prefer the 160GB classic but they do not make it anymore.

When it comes to your music, don't be penny wise and pound foolish.  Syncing it to an iPhone 5S takes no time, skill or instructions.  The amount of quality and listening pleasure you get for $200.00 is amazing.  We should all own fewer things. But the things we own should be of the highest quality.  This is one of them.

$REVIEW.: I'm actually unimpressed with this unit.  And disappointed as well.  The picture is quite grainy and I have the correct settings chosen and am using 5mp images that are the same size format as the screen.  The remote control takes some effort to use.  Have to push buttons multiple times to get the unit to respond.  Pictures are ok but appear washed out, and there doesn't seem to be any contrast or brightness controls anywhere.  I figured I'd go with the more expensive unit to get a better quality.  Ehhhh. I'm unimpressed.  I think it's going back.  Can buy a whole small tv with a DVD player for what this costs, and just out the pictures on a DVD...  Idk. Just unimpressed...  Not the quality I expected.Update 7/30.Ok after figuring out the kind of cumbersome interface I do have to say the frame now working well.  Seems easiest to just load the pictures on an sd card and just leave the card in the frame.  And with the "optimum" setting chosen the pictures look really good.  This frame definately has a better LCD panel than the cheaper models.  It can be seen well from all angles and is nice and bright.  And the 4x3 format is much better for photos than the widescreen sizes.  I use a mac and found that if you click enhance in the iPhoto software the pictures look much better on the frame.  The auto on/off was not working.  But it started working once I discovered that in the menus you have to push enter after you make each selection, even though enter does not appear to do anything.  And then you have to push exit on the remote for changes to set.  So now the auto on/off seems to work.  I do like the frame.  Still think it was a little pricey.  But the picture quality is really very good.  If you are worried about your power bill.  I measured the amp draw.  Running the frame is the same as running a 25 watt light bulb...  Would cost a couple dollars a month to run 24 x 7. I did finally find the picture controls.  They are on the second screen of the setup screens.  Hard to find as there is absolutely no indication in the software that hese is a page 2.

$REVIEW.: This is a nice, big softbox at a very good price!  It helps make the light from your strobe deliciously soft!Yes, it's hard to put together.  Softboxes are like that.  Unfortunately, it doesn't come with instructions.  But you can go to cowboystudio web site (just add dot-com) and find instructions.  There's really not much to it.  Except that it is a bit of a physical challenge.  And, yes, you can poke through the material at the corners.  But that's generally a sign that you put the rod in the wrong place.  After doing so, I thought it was ruined.  But when I put the rod in the right place, it still works perfectly.My real complaint might be the universal speedring it comes with.  Universal means it really doesn't fit any strobe, but you can put it on them anyway.  I think I'll invest in a better speedring.  But, since they can be expensive, I can't complain that it's not included.  And, when all is said and done, the speedring does work perfectly well.  It just doesn't feel all that securely-attached.I am very happy with this softbox.  I don't think I can settle for anything smaller from now on!  And the price can't be beat.

Realizing that the 7D is rumored for a "refresh" in early 2012, I didn't want to spend the extra money versus the 60D.  Ultimately, I opted for the 60D and I have to say, I don't feel like I'm missing anything from the 7D!  This is a fantastic camera and I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with it!

$REVIEW.: The 2 batteries and the charger that came in the kit seem to work fine.  I did not test the car adapter.Charger:I charged one of the Wasabi batteries in the charger that came in the kit and I charged the other Wasabi battery in the charger that came with the A55.  I didn't time it, but both seemed to take about the same amount of time to charge.  As mentioned in other reviews and pictures, there are 2 permanently fixed prongs that stick out of the charger that are designed to hold the battery.  They seem pretty strong, but they do limit the portability of this charger somewhat.Batteries:I read some reviews here where there was a problem with the battery size not being correct.  I did not experience a problem with either battery.  I tested both batteries in my A55 and they worked fine.  The camera was able to show the battery percentage and didn't complain about the battery being non-OEM (a very good thing and a big advantage over other non-OEM batteries).A note on weight:When I unboxed the Wasabi batteries, I was surprised at how light they were, so I weighed them on a food scale and compared the weight to the Sony OEM battery (I posted pictures of this comparison).  The Wasabi battery, supposedly a higher capacity than the Sony (1300 mAh vs 1080 mAh), is significantly lighter than the Sony OEM.Although I haven't compared battery life yet, I'd suspect based on weight that the Wasabi batteries will not last as long as the Sony, which would agree with the other reviews here that DID do a comparison.Over all, I'm still happy with my purchase given that the price of the 2 batteries and charger where still almost a 50% savings over purchasing a Sony OEM battery.

After 100 hours of burn in it still sounds poorly.They also feel very cheaply made.  Almost fragile.I gave them a shot due to all of the press I have seen on them.

$REVIEW.: I loved this stylus the moment I held it
The tip is nice and springy, works great on my 2nd generation Kindle Fire
Tip is long enough to keep the metal of the stylus body from touching the screen, though a few times I used it without thinking and touched the wrong tip, the metal tip and it didn't scratch screen
Well made and nice color, just like the color on the picture

I recommend it to anyone with the Fire, though the clip is too tight to fit on my case, I think that's just because my case is a bit bulky


I will update this if it falls apart or if tip breaks in less than 6-7 months or so, that's a normal life for a stylus, right? It seemed a bit pricey, but I can tell it's better quality than other ones I've bought, and those all seemed to need to be held just right to get a response, this works every time.

$REVIEW.: This product seems like a great starting point for the money

 It's compact and affordable
 When you open it up it feels rather rickety, but once assembled it actually holds up


 Downsides: the bulbs are not that powerful, but new ones can be bought

 The 'case' only holds part of the studio, not all of it

 Other than that, the backdrops really should be ironed prior to first use, and it is A PAIN to iron them

 Otherwise, VERY SATISFIED with my initial investment.

$review_text.: I use this adapter for a blu ray player that I use for Netflix in a room that's on my upstairs floor while my router is downstairs.  Obviously the player did not come with WiFi, so this was the least expensive fix versus getting a wall-plug Ethernet bridge; and let me tell you, it works great- I have no freezing, lags, or anything.  I would definitely recommend this to people in a similar situation.  Once you get the device you will need to hook it to your computer to connect it to your wireless network; then it's just plug'n'play from there.UPDATE: Stopped working :( It was such a cool product, maybe it's getting refurbished that killed it..my experience with refurbished routers on amazon was poor aswell.  My recommendation for wireless products is to buy new.  This thing just all of a sudden stopped working; I tried a hard reset and tried to reconnect to my home wireless signal and while it attempts to connect and says it takes 2 minutes it will drop the connection attempt completely.  I went to update the firmware but I can't even pull up it's settings screen that manual says is [...] .

$review_text.: These batteries work well and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for BACKUP batteries. If you're looking for replacements, I'd suggest buying from Canon. Read on.My 60D reads them just fine. My 70D warns me that they are irregular batteries but works fine after that. My 6D, however, works but won't tell me how much charge remains. This can be a hassle because the camera will shut off when the charge runs out. They're great when you need a battery but they aren't as capable as Canon LP-E6 batteries.As for the charge: They don't last as long as genuine LP-E6 batteries. Maybe about 70% as long. Not a big issue in my opinion if you plan well.

$review_text.: There are a bunch of reasons why this is a great GPS..


 Bluetooth phone connection with voice dialing, traffic lane display, large screen, option to turn voice off, and best of all the ability to adjust speed limits

 I thought the maps were outdated at first, but it was just that some of the speed limits were not displaying correctly
 You touch the speed limit sign and then click to raise or lower

 It then remembers that highway/street for the next time

 Very cool.I am not is a urban location so the traffic notices are not as valuable for me
 However, when we travel to the &#34;big city&#34; and try to navigate the traffic mess, it helps to know what is ahead


 Does exactly what I need...

and it is so much easier to operate than the fancy dash system in my wife's car


 It also knows when you are headed home and gives you the time of travel without doing a thing.

I think this must be due to an inherent faulty design. Of course I could not take some important shots.Like other owners the following are problems:- Won't shoot (as above)- Overcomplicated controls- Three area auto-focus: this is unacceptable- No anti-shake software- Expensive Nikon lensesPros:- Sharp photos (if the auto-focus is working)- Good saturation and colorI am selling this camera and buying a Canon.

$review_text.: I wanted a messenger bag that was large enough to carry my D700, 24-70mm 2.8, 50mm 1.8, flash and iPad.  It needed to be small enough however, where it didn't feel like a huge burden to carry around and stealthy enough not to scream "camera bag" if I was out tooling about town or travelling with my gear.Like all of us these days, I went straight to the Internet to start my search.  The challenge is I didn't have a whole lot of success in finding bags or reviews that explicitly told whether or not they'd work with full frame DSLRs.  Eventually, I was able to find some candidates and narrowed my choices down to the Tenba Mini Messenger and Think Tank Retrospective 7.  Both bags were great in their own right, but in the end, the Tenba offered the best value.Overall, the bag has a business-like look.  Upon first glance, the average person wouldn't think it was a camera bag.  But when you look at it from the side, the width of the bag tells you that this bag holds more than books and a laptop.  It doesn't quite have the hipster-cool look of the Retrospective, but what the Tenba lacks in "coolness", it makes up in utility.Reviews of this bag knock the fact that you can't silence the Velcro that holds the flap down--ideal for situations where the noise would be distracting (school play, wedding, etc.).  What Tenba did instead was include a Quick Access Zipper, which allows you to get right into the bag from the top without even lifting the flap.  For me this is a killer feature because it's much more efficient than lifting a flap of a traditional messenger.Bottom line, this is a great little bag and I simply wanted to share with folks in my position that this bag will accommodate a full frame DSLR w/ 24-70mm 2.8 lens attached.  A big bonus is the bag is large enough to hold a 70-200 2.8 and 13" MacBook Pro as well.What is it:A lightweight, durable daily laptop/camera messenger bagLikes:Tenba quality and durability (1000 Denier Nylon, YKK Zippers, Duraflex Clips)Lightweight and relatively compactBetter than average utility than competitionDoesn't have a camera bag lookA lot of storage pockets for smaller itemsQuick Access zipper is a killer featureRemovable dividers allow for customization of camera gearHolds full frame DSLR (Nikon D800, Canon 5D MkIII) with attached 24-70mm lensCan hold a 70-200mm lensHolds up to 13" laptop (MacBook Pro)Great overall valueNot Likes:Not quite as cool looking or stealthy as other messenger bags in this space (eg. Think Tank Retrospective)Padding on strap could be thickerNo rain cover included--common with camera bags at this price pointNo option to silence the Velcro fasteners that hold down bag flap
$SUMMARY.: This bag will hold a full frame DSLR!

This iPod cassette adapter (on my 2 cars) only works playing on "Side B".After I discovered this (no directions on the package or from Apple), it worked great and I can use it anywhere there is a cassette player.I did notice that in the car that has "OnStar" there is some high pitch feedback that comes though from time to time (mostly noticable on audiobooks), but in the other car it sounds fine.

$review_text.: I recently found a couple of floppy disks with documents on them that I thought had been lost for ever -- the disks were 20+ years old and in a fireproof lockbox! -- and I had no computer with a floppy drive that could read them. I wanted something inexpensive but which would work to help me recover the old docs, and this filled the bill.I plugged the disk drive into the usb port of my Asus laptop running Windows 7, and the computer immediately recognized it. I held my breath and put in the first floppy. I opened the floppy from &#34;My Computer,&#34; and there were all of my old documents -- which I was actually able to open and convert to a modern format.I only needed to use this drive once, so I didn't want to spend much money, but on the other hand, I needed something that would work, and preferably without having to deal with installing new drivers for it. This was perfect for my needs. I'd actually used some Sabrent products before, so I hoped it would turn out to be a reliable drive, and it did.

$review_text.: I truly love, love, love this product

I had ordered one that costs three times as much, but thank God, the order fell through the cracks (got lost somehow)
When I came across this one of equal quality and even prettier colors, I couldn't believe my good luck!Since my old Kindle cover was blue with no easel and was much more costly, I am jumping for joy
I love the easel which makes reading at the table after meals a much more pleasurable experience

When reading "hands free," I'm then reading "landscape" style (or horizontal)
Then when reading in bed, since I enjoy reading the "old-fashioned," book-format way (portrait or vertical), I simply fold the easel back down and read the traditional, two-handed way
Easy-peasey! :-)In fact, I like my Safari Splash cover/stand so well, I ordered another magenta one for my daughter's Christmas gift and a lovely green one for my bff
Another friend saw it and ordered a red one for herself

I wonder if Amazon will give me a commission, if I ask nicely? :-)Since this product comes in black, brown, red, magenta and green, there's one for all tastes

The quality of the leather is excellent, so don't hesitate to recommend it to your friends lucky enough to have the Kindle Fire.Recommended without hesitation!Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 18, 2011Author of "1106 GRAND BOULEVARD"

$REVIEW.: I received this monitor yesterday with Amazons Prime 2-day shipping. I've read many reviews and comparisons so I knew what to expect. Yes the colors out of the box are very bright. I fiddled with Spendid settings and RGB settings and couldn't quite get it perfect (maybe some OCD going on too, lol), So I downloaded a recommended ICC-Profile, these are actually small downloads that you can set in windows (not the monitor) so you could actually use them to adjust the colors on any monitor, the colors are surprisingly perfect now!Next I wanted to set the display for 144Hz, couldn't figure out where to do it? Found it in Nvidia Control Panel under display&#62;change resolution. Make sure you check the game graphics settings and change it to the same refresh rate otherwise things will look off and grainy.Lastly I installed a small program called Stobelight Lightboost Mod, this also installs to Windows, this will reduce motion blur in games, the monitor has Lightboost built in, but is only accessible while in 3D. I wasn't sure at first if this actually working, but it does. Turning quickly, explosions etc. all look detailed and great now. Stroblight sets everything to a 120Hz maximum (if that's the refresh rate you want), and you must pick a different refresh rate for your standard graphics, not sure why, but I set mine to 121Hz.So a couple optional things to make a nice monitor even better, without ever having to modify firmware to the monitor. The build quality surprised me, I've had other Asus monitors with average construction, this one seems like it was their &#34;pride and joy&#34; extremely well built, protective cellophane on everything, the monitor actually has some heft to it as well. The screen adjusts in height using spring tension, tilts up and down, and you could even tun it sideways, reminds me of the TV's at the end of the grocery isle trying to sell me re-fried beans. The base is very sturdy and can rotate, the included dual-link DVI cable is high quality so don't bother buying a different one.Keep in mind this is a &#34;gaming monitor&#34; and it serves it's purpose extremely well, this is not a IPS graphic design / CAD monitor, if you need that then you might want to look at something else.

$REVIEW.: I have other SSDs from OCZ and Corsair that I installed myself, as well as an MBAir with either a Toshiba or Samsung SSD in it, and this Kingston is on par with all of them.  As the boot and program drive, it is fast and reliable.  Compared to running W7-64 off a HDD, there's no comparison.  Both PCs I built that use SSDs are just for casual use (web browsing, moderate gaming, Office suite) and for those tasks and programs this is perfect.  For those that run more demanding, resource-intensive software and require frequent reading/writing from this drive, it may not have the I/O to deliver, but I can't say.  But if you are just a typical computer user, upgrade to this SSD and you won't be disappointed.  I have this 120GB and that's more than enough room to house the OS and Office, plus games.  Probably could have even gotten away with a 60/64GB, but this was on sale and rebate when I bought from TD, so the 120GB was a no-brainer.

$review_text.: I got this to use inside a messenger bag. The materials seem burly and the padding is adequate. But the drawstring top is almost impossible to open or close. It's made of stiff nylon with a very stretchy pull cord. Just to get the cord to slide through the casing in order to open the lid far enough to get a camera in was a comedy routine: I had to squeeze the stiff, burly cordlock through the too-wide rigid nylon webbing that 'protects' it with one hand, pull one side of the top open with the other hand, and try to pull the other side down with my foot. The last few inches to fully open took a few more minutes of coaxing the soft cord into the hard casing. To close it again was even harder -- the cord stretches rather than sliding through the rigid casing.This makes the lid both useless for protection and hard to get out of the way for use. Even if you somehow closed it, the gap in the center would be wide enough to let in dust or water. A soft panel lid that folded back and closed with a zipper or velcro tab would work; this doesn't.In addition, the two chubby dividers are stiffer than the ends of the box. They don't help it hold its shape. When I put in a DSLR and 4" lens, the box becomes football-shaped and bows out on the sides. You have to wonder if anyone at Mountainsmith ever tried this bag.I can fold the top down over the outside of the cube and hope my messenger bag stays closed. But I can't recommend this item.

$REVIEW.: I really like the look of this device


I know aesthetics are not a major concern for a router, but it still looks really nice


Its performance is pretty good, but not great
 N-band supposedly bounces around obstructions more easily than B or G, but I've found that it didn't give me the coverage I wanted in my home


 It can, however, be configured to act as a repeater, and that's how I'm using it

The setup was a little tricky, and required a firmware update on both of my routers, but it was worth the effort to get decent wireless signal up to the second floor and out to the back deck (my cable and primary router are in the basement, which makes getting signal to the whole house difficult (two sets of stairs and a very large cistern are major obstructions).

$REVIEW.: The LowePro 200AW backpack is great lightweight backpack.  The camera compartment is a tight fit.  I can fit a 7d attached with 10-22 and a 50mm.  I think I could add another prime.  Because of the tight fit, I did not try to fit a 70-200mm.I was surprised to find and an outer compartment that I did not find on the website description.  A tablet fits in this compartment quite well.My major complaint is that I wish the camera compartment has a few more inches.  They have room because most of my small items fall in between the camera compartment and the outershell when I place them in the main compartment. And that is annoying to fish things around at the bottom of the bag when you have packed it full.  To me it is dead space, but maybe it was designed that way to fit a tripod.  I could not find a good secure way to attach a tripod so in the main compartment it went to fit the dead space.Another small gripe is that I wish the shoulder straps were a little more padded for longer journey, but overall this so far has been my go to bag.  I liked it so much that I sold my other bags.  The only one I've kept is click elite to support my 70-200mm and bigger lenses.

Since I already have thee Moshi palm guard, And that came with a track pad piece that I also did not install becuase of any sensitivity issues. But other then that the install was a success. The only hard piece was the bottom when it came time to line the holes up. Also when it comes to wetting your fingers with the included solution the bottle has a paper label on it. And after soaking your fingers and switching hands to spray your other hand. The label starts to rub off and you get paper bits on your fingers. Which can really mess up the install. But this thing is way better then the Ipearl Mcover I bought a few weeks ago.

I believe people complain due to their own buyers remorse, which is in no way Amazon's responsibility. The item has flaws, if these piss you off, then buy a different product and learn from your mistake!Now on to the product review.This set contains a wireless keyboard and optical mouse. Pretty standard stuff. I've only ever owned one set like this, the more expensive Logitec EX-100. I will be making most of my judgments in comparison to that item, but i will take into account the fact that this item is cheaper in many waysPROSPriced well for what you get.Has a few worthwhile features like the auto shut-offTiny 2.4Ghz nano reciver (a welcome change from the 4 ft cord of the EX-100)Mouse has a compartment to store the single nano receiver for both unitsThe keys are quiet while typing, less clack (see below)CONSSome keys squeak a little, most notably the larger ones. Its not distracting but it shouldn't be doing it.It has no &#34;Fn&#34; styled function or shortcut keys that are found on almost all laptops and some desktop sets (like my EX-100)The keys feel a bit &#34;liquid&#34; like continents that might shift around each other (hard to explain)The keyboard is a &#34;classic&#34; style by my definition. Large &#34;Return&#34; style enter key, small single key sized &#34;Backspace&#34; buttonAll in all, it gets the job done for some people, and for some people its worthless. Gear Head inst a big name brand people, you want something that works like a Logitec then buy a Logitec. But if you want a cheap keyboard that's lifespan entirely depends on how you take care of it, buy this.

$REVIEW.: Ha, the price dropped after I received mine at $5.99 (now it's $4.99)!  Anyway, these covers are good for the money.I knew I needed a cover with a hard shell back because the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 has very thin borders, which might not take a sewn leather case well.  This case is the right one, the hard shell is perfect fit and the front cover is good enough quality; it might not last long, but you can't expect more for the price.  If it lasted a year, I'll be happy.The front cover also shuts off the tablet when you close it.  I think the magnet for closing could be a little stronger, or the spine be a little stiffer so that the front cover wouldn't shift.  But, the current shifting of the front cover is not really problematic.In any case, at this early stage, where Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 cover is hard to find, this is as good as you can get, for the price.I recommend it!

Another suggestion from a friend said I needed a router, and I wasn't sure because I'm not tech savy.  I took a chance and hooked it up myself in just minutes and it worked really well.

The software was easy to install and quick to configure.The only knock that I could see, it does use a lot of memory (he has a laptop with 2GB of RAM running Vista Home Premium).  We had to kill some apps running in the background to fix the choppiness of the audio.  Once this was done it produced a crystal clear picture and sound.We didn't use the cable/satellite option, we stayed with just the rabbit ear for reception.  The antenna picked up a couple of channels the old fashion roof antenna was not able to pick up analog style.Recommended for those who want HDTV on their computer or those who travel.

$REVIEW.: This was my second Cooler Master. The first one I bought was a U3 model with three fans. I used that one in an unconventional fashion. It is currently cooling two Buffalo 1tb external drives and another 1tb drive in an enclosure. It is working well at that task.This u2 version cools my Macbook 13" very well. It keeps the HD temperature between 86 and 90F, depending on external climates.I probably could have stood to spend a little more money to cool more evenly but my biggest concern was keep the Hitachi 320GB HD inside of the Macbook cool. The last Hitachi 320GB HD that I had inside of the MacBook failed. I'm not sure if it was due to overheating but before getting a replacement I wanted to make sure there was additional cooling. So far, so good.  I have one of the fans positioned near the rear of the cooler and one just under the location where the internal HD is located on the Mac. Seems to be working well.If I was forced to lit a gripe, it would be that the angle on these units is steep enough to cause a notebook to slide off. The rubber accents just are not enough to prevent this.  If you look at the user provided photos, you'll see the unit being propped up buy something to avoid slippage. I've done this with both units that I have. Not a deal breaker but just something of which to be aware when considering this unit.
$SUMMARY.: Nice Cooling At A Nice Price - Quiet fans.

I bought this filter as protection for my 70-200L IS II and couldn't be happier


There is no degrade in image quality that I can visibly tell

Also, I prefer &#34;clear&#34; for protection versus &#34;UV Haze&#34;, though I don't know if it's more transparent (it costs more???).There are many photography places that carry this, but I like to buy it from Amazon more


First is because of the fast, free Prime shipping

$REVIEW.: It is a very cost effective way to add some &#34;smart&#34; TV capabilities to your existing television, as long as it has a free HDMI port, but it is not without its flaws. Video playback is excellent, and running Android 4.1, you can use almost any app from Google play or Amazon app store, although you will have to download Amazon app store, perfect for those that already have an Android 4.1 based phone or tablet. The default text font is large, so browsing on a TV, like my 42&#34; panasonic from a bedroom or living room sitting distance is no problem. It uses very little power, I leave mine on constantly with no issues, it gets warm to the touch, but not so hot that it may cause concern. I did not use the included usb power adapter, since it is not UL rated, but I used a generic adapter rated at 2A that is UL rated and double insulated for peace of mind. The mini pc stick itself is wide, much wider than a common USB thumb drive, so it may actually take up enough space that you will not be able to connect to an adjacent HDMI port, get an HDMI extender cable to prevent this device from taking up an adjacent HDMI Port. The wifi is totally unreliable, my mini pc is about 4' from the router, and even then, it will not maintain a solid connection. The Bluetooth is also affected by RF interference, be it from a 2.4Ghz wireless keyboard or other Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth will work, but you have to make sure its enabled first thing after you power on the device, and even then, you may have to reboot the mini pc to make the Bluetooth stable. I use Bluetooth headphones with this device, and it has a nasty habit of making the video stutter, either local playback or streaming, when I adjust the volume on the headphones. My solution to this is to not change the volume while a video is playing.  Manufacturer support is completely non existent, the instruction sheet does not list any manufacturer website or a source for updates, so expect to be on your own. The instructions included are in badly translated English, but if you are familiar with an Android phone or tablet, you should not need them. Instructions indicate that you do not need external power, that it can get power from the HDMI port, this is not true. If you are getting this device, get a powered USB hub so you can attach drives or other devices. I will strongly recommend that you also get a USB to Ethernet adapter, having mentioned the unreliability of wifi.

$REVIEW.: As I've gotten older, my neck and shoulders can get sore even holding something as light as my tablet, so I recently traded in my iPad 2 for a new iPad Mini. I was surprised at how difficult it was to find a slip case for the Mini. What seems to be out there are mostly covers, which are too bulky. After all, what's the point of trying to lessen the weight of my tablet if I only add it back with the case or cover?I found this one from iBlason and it's ideal. First and foremost, it's a slip case, not a cover. It weights almost nothing because it's made of neoprene, and therefore doesn't add to the overall weight of carrying the Mini. I don't own a Smart Cover for it, but it's clear to me that the case has enough room to accommodate the Mini, even with cover attached.The interior is made of something called Super Slime (?), but suffice it to say it's nothing like what it sounds like. It is great protection for both the front and back of the Mini, and there is no way the tablet could be scratched with this surface.There is a front pocket to the case, which I first I thought was superfluous, but is perfect for packing the cable and charger when I travel, which is fairly often. That pocket would also be convenient for any add-ons for the Mini you might own, as well as a polishing cloth to clean the glass. When I'm simply throwing the Mini in my backpack, the iBlason case is perfect for adding extra protection and keeping my iPad Mini looking new!If I have any criticism at all, it's that the zipper pulls are very large in relation to the case. It would also be nice if they were black and not silver, but honestly, this is nitpicking over what is really an excellent slip case for the iPad Mini. Having owned it for a couple weeks, I'd purchase it all over again.

$review_text.: I'm not going to go into the technical details, because these wireless routers are all basically the same. For some odd reason, the theory of setting up these routers is as simple as pie... except it never is. It should be 1-2-3 and you're surfing, but inevitably there are problems.And that's why you should buy this router. D-Link offers easy and free tech support, and you're going to need it at some point, regardless of which brand you buy. So why not get a brand that offers great support?Over the past 1.5 years I've moved the router around and had no problems using it on DSL and cable broadband connections. The only time I had issues with setup was in Florida at my mom's condo. Turns out Bellsouth (now AT&T;) has some funky DSL modems that need special settings. Not the D-Link's fault, but the D-Link techs were able to help with with it. Nice!

$review_text.: This is an awesome little blue-tooth speaker. It is really easy to pair (connect) using Bluetooth with either iPad or iPhone and once you connect, it reconnects as soon as you turn the speaker back on. The rubberized exterior makes it durable and compact size (Size: 6.2" wide, 2.5" tall, 1.6" deep) makes it easy to throw in your bag and take with you. I found the sound quality to be good considering it's compact size, but a bit on the flat side. I also have a Sound Blaster speakerCreative Sound BlasterAxx SBX8 Audio Speaker with Microphone(although non-bluetooth), and when comparing the two the Sound Blaster wins hands down.There's 3 buttons on top: a negative sign (-) to turn volumn down, a postive sign (+) to turn volumn up, and a dot (.) to pair. Pairing is easy, just hold the button down till the side light starts blinking and then go into your iPad or iPhone settings and click on the Blue-Tooth setting. You will see SP1 come up on the list, then click to connect. You can move the speaker up to 30 feet away before it disconnects. Another reviewer said 'Bluetooth connectivity needs direct line of sight so audio is not disrupted', but I did not find that so; I was able to move around into various rooms of my house without it disconnecting.The power switch is on the side and doubles as a status light. It flashes depending on the status:Flashing Red means low batteryAlternating Red and White means it's chargingSolid white means it's on and fully chargedFlashing white means it's in pairing mode and trying to connect, goes solid white once connected.Below the power switch is the headphone jack (which I never use) and the power plug in. You get a 3.5 stereo headphone connection cable (if you don't want to use bluetooth). You also get a USB power cable, but you have to supply your own wall USB plug or use a computer USB port to charge it. Both cables are kind-of cheesy, thin cables, so I'm concerned that they won't withstand long-term use. The speaker uses an internal lithium-ion batter to recharge. The battery is not replaceable, so this unit has a limited life once the battery goes bad! It took about 3 hours to charge..but no way to know how much charge is left. The manufacturer says it has 10 hour playback time, but I found that it lost power soon than that.I marked down by 1 star for these three reasons.Flat sound compared to my Sound Blaster Speaker.Thin USB and speaker jack cables.Non-replaceable battery.Other than that, I love the unit. It works well and love the design! For the price, this is an awesome, easy-to-use, decent quality speaker!

$REVIEW.: I have zero complaints about this monitor. The image is crisp and clear, and the brightness is excellent. I did not have to adjust anything, it just looked good right out of the box.Even though Asus does not provide a monitor profile (or driver) for this monitor, I did not experience any issues with Windows 7 not filling the screen like one previous reviewer. I also have not detected any of the "back light bleed" that another reviewer mentioned.The unique style of this monitor looks great on my desk. I have read some other reviews on other sites that criticized the stand as being "flimsy" or "shaky" and also as difficult to assemble. My own experience was completely opposite. The stand is constructed on sturdy metal - not plastic. I found it easy to assemble without any tools. The monitor is not unstable or shaky in the least. The stand allows the monitor to easily swivel and tilt to your preferred angle.

$REVIEW.: Great in 2009

 Dont buy it in 2014 or later, there are better products today.I read a lot of Mini Laptop reviews before choosing this Toshiba,  I own 3 Dell laptops of various sizes and I was on the Dell web site about to order the Mini10v for 300 dollars when I started reading the reviews


 For an extra 30 to 50 bucks I decided on the Toshiba


 It looks great, its fast, keyboard is easy to use

 The wifi connected automatically to my home network the first time I turned it on,  It immediately found my DLink router and just asked for the password


 It was incredibly easy.I am ok with the Windows 7 starter and see no need to upgrade to the Home Edition

 The only thing that I miss is customizing the wallpapaer but I would not pay for that feature.I bought the Microsoft Ultimate Steal bundle available to college students which inlcuded WORD, EXCEL, Powerpoint and Publisher
 The installed software had a trial version


 If you choose not to buy it after the trial, you get Microsoft WORKS,The Mini is light and very easy to use
 So far, its done everything my full size laptops do including internet, email and ipod itouch synching

 Like all Minis, it does not have a CD/DVD drive.The model numbers are confusing

 The older versions using Windows XP and have a smaller hard drive
 The current model comes in a variety of colors which can have a big impact on the price

 Basic Black is the cheapest but it still look great and sleek.Highly Recommended![...][...][...]

$review_text.: This product works fantastically......however if you have read the title and description "VGA Adapter to TV" and took it for what it says, then you have been misled.I don't blame any of the people that have complained about this item one bit and think that the "holier then thous" that feel they need to snub everyone as being stupid, ignorant, incompetent, etc....for understanding the description exactly for how it was written which is "This VGA Adapter to TV S-Video RCA Out Cable ALLOWS VIDEO OUTPUT FROM YOUR PC/LAPTOP COMPUTER TO ANY TV" needs to quit acting like they're so damn smart because anyone who read the title and description would OF COURSE, 100%, think that it converts the signal FROM the pc TO the tv......after all, it's what it says it does, not the other way around.Furthermore, I can guarantee that most of the "holier then thous" also purchased this product because THEY TOO wanted to use the the adapter for the same purpose as the rest of us....which was to "ALLOW VIDEO OUTPUT FROM YOUR PC/LAPTOP COMPUTER TO ANY TV", they're just too egotistical and self righteous to admit that yes, they too were wrong in thinking that the description would actually correctly describe what the adapter actually does.If I bought a necklace online which I received only to find out that the description "Fits any neck size" actually meant "Fits any wrist size" then I would of course come to the conclusion that the description is wrong and not that the people who are saying "it doesn't fit any neck size" were wrong, because then it would just show that I was nothing more then an arrogant, senseless twit that honestly has no idea of what I'm talking about. I would then put on a dunce cap and go sit in the corner as those around me took aim and pelted the back of my head with spit wads.This product is for hooking up something like an x-box, or a playstation so that you can play it on your pc's monitor. It is not for hooking your computer monitor up to your t.v.

The only problems are when you ask to find a place name that's not all that well know or has a funny name.  Vocally searching by address works well too.The screen is glass instead of plastic and is very responsive to the touch.This is more expensive than other units but for someone who depends on a good GPS it's well worth it.Updates works well.

It came in on time and in perfect condition.The cable is sturdy, has the protective caps on the end and connects securely to the equipment. As has been pointed out on optical cables the signal either goes through or it doesn't; the size of the cable is not an issue. It is, nevertheless, comforting to hold a substantial feeling cable with sturdy construction; one feels at an emotional level that this cable will just work better.This cable provides that extra level of encouragement to the buyer!

 These things look and feel like guitar cables which is nice

 They're a little stiff, but will probably loosen up with use.My only problem- and it's a big problem -is how tightly they fit my phone and Touchpad's USB ports


 I thought a tight fit would be a good thing, but it turned out that the cable may have actually damaged my tablet


 Fortunately I know the kind of geeks that can probably fix a stretched micro-USB port, but for now I'm only using these cables with equipment whose connection doesn't feel so tight.And yes, the Touchpad had been charged using many, many different micro-USB cables previously, none of which caused any positional problems.

Case and point.If it's still available it's probably the last of the Audigy chipset cards made. If you like them and need a PCI card, get it but be sure to use the drivers from the web site NOT on the disc. Just take the disc (unopened) and put it away for safe keeping. It will not work on anything above Windows XP.And this is from a lifetime Creative fan. I have given them SO MUCH money I should own part of the company... :)

$REVIEW.: It's not a bad little camera, but one big thing I found is it's hard to get a decent steady shot. Most any camcorder your going to need a tripod, and this one is no exception.  The image can become shaky even though the zoom is quite smooth. You can really notice the shakiness when at full zoom. The still pictures left a lot to be desired.It has not only an easy mode but the settings most wanna be pro videographers want as well. Most people will probably just set it on auto and go, which is probably best since playing with some of the settings manually didn't improve the video that much.I think given its size this is probably something that's great for the mom or dad that wants something offers a bit more than a Flip style video camera will give you.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my Sony a77 to trigger my Sigma EF-610 DG ST flash and it doesn't work at all. I've tried calling Cowboy Studio three times since I got these triggers last week to see if it's my flash and they haven't returned my calls. Another problem I have with it is that the bottom of the receiver is a normal hot shoe mount so it can't  use the the little stand that came with my flash because it's a Sony mount and they're not compatible without an adapter. Also the screw to tighten the umbrella stem to the receiver is almost impossible to tighten by hand. Once I buy another flash and it works I'll update this post and raise it a star or two but because Cowboy Studios customer service is horrible no matter how good they work it'll never get anything more then 3 stars. Oh yeah I called Sigma and they said this won't work but they weren't very helpful and was a bit short with me which I'm really disappointed about. If you haven't made the move to Sony don't do it stick with Canon or Nikon because it's a pain in the butt to get stuff for it and the Sony store has been the worst shopping experience I've ever had.

$review_text.: I've had the opportunity through the Vine program to test a number of Airplay speakers (Sony, Philips, JBL, and Logitech). So far, this is the best of the bunch. The closest competitor is the Sony SA-NS410 (click through my profile to find my review of that device). The Logitech outguns the Sony. There are some high-end Airplay speakers arriving on the market (Bang & Olufsen, Bowers & Wilkins, Libratone, McIntosh, Nocs) that make fewer compromises, but I'm not holding my breath for review copies of any of them.-The Logitech is is one of the larger single-unit systems and so it has larger components. The tweeters and woofers are large enough to give a level of quality and volume that is similar to a small bookshelf system (emphasis on small). This is the first WiFi/Airplay unit that I would consider as a potential stand-alone replacement for the traditional stereo rather than as an extension of a traditional sound system. My two caveats are that you still don't have a properly spaced speaker system to give you great stereo sound (e.g., left-right sound) and while the volume is good, it is not roll-up-the-carpet, bring-down-the-house loud. Still, I would have been happy with this speaker as a teenager rocking out in my room, and it is a great device to take out on the deck for a BBQ. It is able to hold its own in many situations.-Design and build quality is very good. This is my second recent Logitech speaker review, and they are making solid and well designed products. Nothing feels cheap about this. The controls are well thought out. The volume control, for example, is a proper dial, not an up/down button. The iPod dock is there when you want it, hidden when you don't.-Network connection is straightforward and robust. Initial set-up can be done by attaching an iOS device and downloading the app, or you can use the WiFi setup button on the back of the unit and browse the unit's start page wirelessly (say with a laptop). I've had no difficulty connecting the unit from long distances from my wireless router, as well as through thick masonry walls. The unit has maintained its connection and has yet to drop-out on its own [NOTE: all WiFi speakers that I've tested suffer from occasional drop-outs, usually due to interference, say from a microwave. That is one of the downsides of a WiFi speaker.] The unit also includes a 3.5mm audio in as well as a LAN ethernet jack. The ethernet jack gives you a much more robust connection and is something worth using if you end up placing the speaker near the router.-My only complaint at the moment is the need to turn the unit back on after suffering a power-failure (which are all too frequent in my neighborhood). I would prefer a hard switch (that retains its on/off position) or a soft switch with memory.-Relative to the other brands I've tested, I think Logitech comes out ahead in terms of the entire design. Logitech's speaker series are well thought-out, from the controls to the related iOS app. The volume control, for example, is a proper dial, not up-down buttons. The main downside to this particular speaker is the cost; I do hope that it gets discounted. I also hope (and expect) that the next iteration of this speaker will disband with the dock.-The speaker's iOS app is fine. It allows you to easily set up the speaker with your WiFi network. Once running, the app allows you to adjust treble and bass. It also includes a signal strength indicator, a FAQ, and a firmware update link.-The power cord is in two parts and includes a transformer (input 1.5 amps) that resides halfway down the cables. You have about 9 feet for cord to play with.Some comments about Airplay speakers in general:-Airplay has been very good at allowing other people to play their music in our house. In an environment where there are a number of music collections, it is handy for different people to port to whatever speaker they want (and this can be done simultaneously with different iTunes accounts in different parts of the house).-Airplay has been very useful in porting our iPad's sound (the iPad's own speaker is lacking). For example, if I am playing a video on my iPad, I can port the sound to a nearby Airplay speaker. This has been very, very handy.-Unless you are in a small living space, speakers like this Sony or the aforementioned Logitech work best in conjunction with a traditional stereo speaker system that is itself receiving an Airplay feed (e.g., via an Apple Airport Express).Cheers

$REVIEW.: I purchased this pair of headphone around four years ago.  I used it from time to time - much less lately.  At the very beginning, I first ran it for at least a hundred hours - leaving it plug to a CD player or PC and keep playing a few different kinds of music.  I found the headphone reproducing high frequencies and low frequencies quite good.  However, it lacks mid-ranging; resulting that the music reproduced felt a bit &#34;thin&#34; and not warm enough (but not harsh).  I mostly listen to classical music, easy listening, Jazzy, vocal, instrumental, etc., but no hard rock.Also, it's not comfortable for wearing long times -- more than 30 mins -- you'll feel too warm to your ears; also the headphone is a bit heavy.

This was one of the main reasons why I bought it .Even the handle has screw threads if you need to mount it on a tripod then extend it up. The metal clamp holds the iPhone 5S very securely with or without a case. The extra 3 ft of reach is great for taking pics over a crowd or for selfies that don't look like selfies. You do need to download a camera timer app, but there are several free ones available.I took one star off because as many others have said the black rubber piece on the top part of the clamp comes off very easily. It is just held in place by friction and mine fell off just by being jostled in a gear bag. On the plus side it does still work fine without the rubber piece although there is a higher likeliness of the metal on metal causing scratches on your iPhone if you don't have it in a case or bumper.

$review_text.: This case has a great feel and touch to it, it fits my iPad mini with retina display perfectly and offers protection

At one point during my initial assessment, I was holding the front cover of the case and shooking it vigorously, my mini stayed in securely

The best part is it is also very thin and light keeping my mini easy to carry around
The magnetic  cover also turns on and off my mini flawlessly, a feature lacked in another Belkin case I had bought


Another outstanding accessory made by Belkin.

$review_text.: Before I started running I was an avid photographer and would always have my camera near by. But running made this too difficult since my DSLRs (and even my mirrorless) cameras are too heavy and awkward to run with. When I saw this bag in brought to mind that I could take up trail running with the intent to make photographs after a run. So I've outfitted this pack with the 70oz CamelBak Rucksack accessories Antidote Reservoir, a 7D with a 28-75mm 2.8 lens and a 100mm macro, and filled the large cargo area with a variety of snacks and gear. While running the camera felt very stable cinched in it's sub case located in the side zipper pouch located at approximately the small of my back. I was concerned at first about putting a 2 liter bag of water so close to my camera, but there are several waterproof layers that it would have to get though and after my run I noticed non of the bag's condensation escaped or soaked in, so I'm pretty confident about it now. The main cargo area is utilitarian, If I was going to camp or change clothes it would be very practical since is just a huge cinched sack (with a clipped cover). I usually won't need the full cargo space so some of my more fragile snacks like bananas get banged up a little bit if I don't put in at least a small towel. As for comfort I found it put no fatigue on my back and possibly offered some lumbar support. I did find the straps took a little getting used to, at first one shoulder strap bounced a little and rubbed my neck, but after it was adjusted it was fine. Also the waist strap goes around mu belly button, it works but I think I'd prefer it to be lower (it might just be because I'm 6'3"). I found I really liked running with hydration right there without having to carry a bottle, I think I'll end up getting a hydration only pack for longer road runs too because of this. The only thing I didn't like was that securing the mouth piece was a little cumbersome with the push through straps, I think some sort of clip at the end would have been easier... I might fashion something out of Velcro. But really this is a minor muscle memory issue since I'll eventually be able to do it without looking or thinking.PROS:+ Running (or other sports) + Photography WIN!+ Camera stays very stable and snug (it has adjustable bungee inside to increase/decrease snugness)+ Camera area stays dry despite all the liquid cargo+ Holds lots of cargo+ Very waterproof, but has a cover over bag built-in, just in case of a monsoon+ Ergonomic design prevents back strainCONS:- Camera area is limited to one mounted lens and one accessory lens/flash (unless you're shooting mirrorless and/or pancakes)- Hydration channeling is great but final strap could be a clip- Giant cargo area could be subdivided to make it more practical for smaller outings.CONCLUSION:I have other camera backpacks and slings and while they may be okay for walking and the occasional sprint across the airport, the gear inside bounces too much for a long distance/off road run. This bag gives me the peace of mind that my gear is secure, provides for hydration and still lets me enjoy the sport. A solid 5 star product.

$REVIEW.: My brother needed a backpack that was larger than his previous Canon backpack. My brother likes it very much. It is a bit heavier but that can be a good thing when it comes to protection of your equipment. It does have a rain cover that if not careful you might not see it. It is on the bottom of the pack. Everything works well including the wheels. The pull bar could be a bit sturdier but again do you want more weight. If careful in handling, it might not every have an issue. We have not tried going on an airline yet but that is a bit of a concern as it is large. Inside the case is plenty of room for 2 cameras, flash, several lenses as well as your accessories. It is a very well built unit overall and would recommend it if you need a lot of space.

$REVIEW.: This is my first exposure to Panasonic Active Noise Canceling (ANC) headphones

This particular model is very inexpensive relative to most ANC phones on the market, and unfortunately the low price is justified

These phones fall short on a couple of important areas.First and foremost, these are ANC phones and the ANC function does indeed work

That said, the degree to which it works is in line with the pricing

I have a very specific fan in the house that I use as a benchmark, as most ANC phones are able to nearly completely wipe out the white noise that this fan generates when on the lowest speed setting


The Panasonic phones kill a good bit of the fan noise but allow more noise than almost every other ANC set I have tried
In the office I tried these phones in an area serviced by two large air handlers that generate a lot of noise and these headphones did remarkably well though still not as well as most other phones I have tried in the same environment
Now, when compared to the likes of Bose, Panasonic does a very poor job but then again they cost maybe 15% of what Bose costs
When considering this price differential the Panasonic phones do a decent job with their ANC which should be acceptable by most for traveling.One area where these phones fail, though, is in build quality

These headphones are extremely lightweight and they feel very flimsy and fragile

These are not the headphones to take when traveling frequently


To add insult to injury, they come with a cloth carry bag which offers absolutely no protection at all beyond serving as a dust cover.Worse, though, is the miserable sound quality

I don't know if my specific headset is the problem but while I have a decent full range of sound, everything across the spectrum sounds slightly tinny and hollow
I was encouraged that Panasonic does not overdrive the bass as many manufacturers tend to do and instead delivers a fairly balanced spectrum, but this does not make up for the poor quality of sound

As these are inexpensive headphones I would never expect them to be audiophile quality, but the sound should absolutely be much better than it is.I was encouraged to see that Panasonic includes a 2-prong adapter in the package, but then they omit the 1/4" adapter which is something I actually use.Panasonic has made a very inexpensive ANC headphone and unfortunately the low cost is justified

While the ANC capabilities are within reason for the price range, the sound quality and build quality are severely lacking
If looking for ANC phones for the purpose of using the ANC function, and keeping costs low is important, then these phones may fill that need acceptably

However, if sound quality is in any way important, these are the wrong phones and will sorely disappoint.

$SUMMARY.: Disappointing even at the low price range

$review_text.: With all the bags to choose from, I settled on this one because of its size and positive reviews. I needed a bag that was not huge but was large enough to hold all the items I wanted to take. We went to Europe for 2 1/2 months and it was a planes, trains aand automobiles trip. The bag was strong and stood up to some rough usage. I did not have any problem with the zippers or compartments. Here is a list of what I was able to carry in the bag: Canon 5d MkII, 85mm telephoto, 70-150mm telephoto zoom, 28-135mm telephoto zoom, 2x extender, flash, Canon battery charger w/ extra battery, eight AA batteries with charger, large Sony laptop with power cord, GPS with charger. Don't get me wrong, there was no room for anything else, but I hauled this around many countries, and it did a fantastic job. I thought for sure it would show wear and tear, but it looks great and I'm happy as can be. I must say it would not be a great bag for other types of photography where one needs to haul tripods or other types of equipment, but for a "go bag" type camera case, it is worth considering.
$SUMMARY.: Great Bag

$REVIEW.: I purchased this Targus laptop PC chill mat for an HP G50 with a 15.4" screen, after a less expensive Belkin model became very noisy after a few months of use.  The improvement in quality is amazing!  I can barely hear the dual fans running on the AWE55US, even though they are doing their cooling job very well.  Also, the Targus product seems to fit the laptop better, and both are much less prone to sliding around during normal use.  I would recommend this product to anyone.

$review_text.: The wide zoom--16-35, 17-35, 17-40, 20-35, et al.--has been a mainstay of pros, especially photo journalists, since the early 1990s. These focal lengths are ideal for sweeping views and shooting in tight quarters, and are easily hand holdable. The 17-40L is my go-to wide zoom for landscape shooting on my 5D MKII and 6D. Important note: if you use a 1.6X cropped frame camera, e.g., Rebel, 60D, 70D, etc., this zoom will have the field of view of a normal zoom, i.e., 28-65mm equivalent.CONSTRUCTION: Canon's EF 17-40 4L USM brings together precision optical design, blazing AF, durable construction and silky smooth zooming. At $750, it's more affordable than the EF 16-35 2.8L USM II, but offers similar build and optical quality. The hybrid metal and polycarbonate construction and quality components make the EF 17-40 4L USM tough as nails, but a lightweight 475 g (16.8 oz). Plus, the moisture and dust seals, including a rubber O-ring on the lens mount, make it a great choice for jungle and beach shooters. Canon recommends use of a clear or UV filter to complete weather sealing (front element moves slightly when zooming).The EF 17-40 4L USM is a classic two-touch design: manual focus ring near the end of the barrel and zoom ring near the mount. Handling is nimble and decisive. Both zoom and focus mechanisms are internal so there is no nested barrels. Plus, internal mechanisms are less prone to sucking in dust than front extension designs. Unlike most AF lenses, the manual focus ring is large, ribbed, rubberized and nearly as smooth turning as the manual lenses of yesteryear. The satin black finish is elegant and the overall appearance similar to the EF 16-35 2.8 USM II and EF 24-105 4L IS USM.The filter size is 77 mm, making filters expensive. This size is common for L series optics, so you can share filters with the EF 70-200 2.8L IS USM and EF 24-105 4L IS USM. The clearance from the edge of the front element to the filter threads is huge and, subsequently, normal thickness filters such as a Hoya Super HMC UV do not vignette on full frame cameras like the 5D MKII or 6D.AUTO FOCUS: This lens sports a ring-type USM (Ultrasonic Motor) that drives an internal lens group and AF really rips. The front element does not rotate nor does the barrel expand or contract during focus and zoom operations. The motor of the EF 17-40 4L USM is silent during AF. It has Full Time Manual (FTM), allowing you to manually focus without switching out of AF mode. If you prefocus manually, the distance window in meters and feet is handy. AF worked flawlessly on my 5D MKII, 6D, 5D,  A2, 3 and Elan 7E. That is, AF is fast, accurate and decisive.IMAGE QUALITY: The constant F4 aperture is a big plus for hand meter users and those that prefer manual or aperture priority exposure modes.I found EF 17-40 4L USM sharp and contrasty. There is slight improvement when stopped down to F5.6 or F8, but it is almost as good wide open. The contrast and snap of this lens is apparent even through the viewfinder. After all, there's exotic glass in there, e.g., 1 UD and 2 aspherical elements. The short end, like most wide zooms, shows some barrel distortion. The long end has a small amount of pincushion distortion. For most use, distortion isn't a problem save for architectural photography.Flare is well controlled for a zoom. However, some flare and ghosting may occur with bright sunsets. Use the included lens shade (EW-83E) to protect the lens and help keep flare in check. Incidentally, the included EW-83E is a weak design: too shallow and dish-like, yielding a minimal amount of protection. The EW-83H, a deeper and narrower hood intended for the EF 24-105 4L IS USM, gives better protection and does not vignette at any zoom setting on both full frame and cropped cameras.FINAL BLURB: I bought the 17-40 4L in 2003. Ten years of punishment at beaches, waterfalls, jungles and deserts and it's still going strong, having outlived at least a half dozen of my cameras! If you need the versatility of a wide zoom, this is among the best. The EF 17-40 4L USM has similar build and optical quality as the famous EF 16-35 2.8L USM II, but at nearly half the price, weight but shy a F-stop. For discriminating hikers, travelers, landscape shooters and serious amateurs this zoom deliverers quality without breaking their shoulder or bank and can take the knocks they dish out.

Most of my use for this will be for still shooting, but I do find it a little heavy for using this out in the field, you guys might not have a problem but for me lugging this around in fields might be a problem.I do recommend this for anyone that wants a good tripod and can not spend more than $150.

$review_text.: I read all kinds of stuff about this lens... how it's slow to focus (no it isn't), poorly made (not really), not sharp (entirely untrue). I took this lens out yesterday and today. I tried it in shade, in bright sunlight, at full extension, fully retracted, wide open, stopped down, bracketing in bursts. Not every shot was perfect, but the vast majority were excellent bordering on phenomenal.I was certainly hoping for a great lens, but I was ready to accept mediocre, given the price and all. I wish it were faster but I find that raising the ISO to 400 gives me a good deal of extra latitude. I haven't tried in under very low light, but I didn't buy it for that purpose.  So the answer is that I'm really very pleased. Fast and accurate auto focus, good IS. Well made.Two things to note: Definite lens creep, but I can live with it. And it is rather heavier than I expected and I don't know if I can use it for the walking around lens I was hoping it could be. It might not be too heavy for someone with stronger and younger wrists, but I'm no spring chicken and my wrists are problematic. My granddaughter found it heavy, but not so much that it made it hard for her to handle. Ah to be 15 again!So don't think twice. If you can't afford L glass, this WILL do a good job for you. And you'll still have some folding money in your jeans!

$review_text.: I purchased these to go in my 1988 mustang hatchback.These speakers are being run off of a Dual headunit, and they are paired with the 6.5" in the doors and they are PLENTY loud
I thought about just buying tweeters for the dash but i figured a little extra mid range would help, and that was the right decision!These speakers come with a sticky foam pad the works kinda like a gasket for the speaker, it helps with the vibrations A LOT!they also come with two extra resistors or bass blockers, i used though and i'm very glad i did


I soldered and heat shrunk all the connections.I have these infinity reference 3.5" in the dash, 6.5" infinity reference custom mounted in the door, and infinity reference 6x8's in the rear panel and they sound absolutely amazing! i have previously owned, pioneer, Boston acoustic, and alpine speakers and by far these are my favorite


They are so good I'm thinking about replacing the 4 brand new Pioneer 6x8"s in my explorer just because i am so thrilled with these speakers.Bass output on these speakers is very good, these speakers sound great if you turn the bass way up, i have not been able to hear ANY distortion in these even at maximum bass.However, these speakers can go both ways


I have mine tweaked so that the produce mid-range and high-range only, since i have a bazooka SUB in the back, but i will soon replace that with an infinity basslink system.Overall these speakers are great for anyone, if you just need a simple, cheap replacement or want to go all out and build a great system these speakers will do it all, without issues


I have a new found love for the infinity brand, they are a great quality piece at an amazing price everyone can afford.Don't waste your money on all the fancy $100+ speakers, these speakers are just as good! i can not imagine how much better they will perform if i were to run them off an amplifier!

The design was a bit confusing at first but it's a really easy technique...just pinch the two corners into the middle and you can orient the iPad horizontally or vertically, something not many covers this slim can do.  I also like that you can fold the cover in a more traditional &#34;roll up&#34; fashion for a lower desktop-like position.  The material has a smooth, slightly rubbery texture and the fit is perfect.  It snaps shut securely and stays put until it's opened.  The generous cutouts around the switches and ports also provide easy access--important if you have any large plugs.  This is a great choice if you're looking for durable, lightweight protection.

$REVIEW.: Bought this unit at another retailer several years ago. Happy for quite  a while, then something happened to ability to connect to home wifi network. All other devices in house continue to work fine. That includes laptops, tablets, printers, DVD player, and Roku. Searched for support online. Found forums full of similar complaints. Lots of potential solutions but none has worked for me. Even purchased an extender for wireless router. As it is I have to sit on floor in front of the router or the extender to get more than a single bar and to access anything including Amazon. I used device to watch Amazon movies on Prime, will not be continuing Prime subscription since this POS won't connect well enough to view anything. Of course it does not have an Ethernet connection so I can't even wire the paperweight to the internet.No apparent solution from Apple in the works as they appear to not recognize the problem is an iPad problem.I believe Apple IOS updates have degraded the capability. Probably a corporate decision in order to sell new devices or sell devices with 3G/4G so continuing revenue stream come in from the ISP subscriptions.I can't believe the lemmings in the Apple market let this company get away with the stunts they pull.
$SUMMARY.: Expensive and useless paperweight

$REVIEW.: Bought this to go with my old (about 10 years) Brother PT-85 P-Touch labeler. This one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface. Used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet; easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools. Fits and works perfectly. Nice to know I can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printer.

$REVIEW.: I figured out why my old microSD card died on me.  When I plugged in my old Android phone at work, the antivirus software of my laptop wanted to scan the whole thing every time.  I was plugging it in to charge it, but the constant reads wore out the flash.  My new Android phone mounts as a CD drive (instead of the entire thing). I can only see the phone if I unmount my CD drive.  This is perfect for charging at work now.  Be careful with virus scanners if you have an Android phone that auto mounts your entire phone's Micro SD!

$review_text.: I now own five of these.  Bought the first one about two years ago.  Each time I am in the market for another mouse (adding laptops and even desktop systems to the family) I read the reviews, ask users of other mice (I work in the industry so there are always a lot of folks around with mice), touch and feel, and compare.  I keep coming back to this one for a variety of reasons.1)  For a laptop mouse, it's a good size (would prefer even larger).2)  Very long battery life, especially compared to bluetooth mice.3)  Standard batteries (2xAA).4)  Accuracy and responsiveness.5)  Brand trust.6)  Only has the button/controls I use so nothing gets accidently clicked.7)  Quality build.The above are not necessarilly in order of importance.  I would buy another (if I needed a mouse).  I even use them on desktop systems.

$REVIEW.: I just hooked up a Netgear 3500L V.2 Gigabite router, about 2 weeks ago. My main PC was only running at 100Mpb, yellow light on router indicates that. Took 1 minute to install, and Win 7 auto detected new device, auto loaded driver, green light now on router or 1000Mpb. After reading the reviews, I decied not to go with a cheaper product, and I am very happy with this product. Skip the cheaper one's, save a headack, cause thier like rolling dice. The entire set up install, reboot, auto detect was about 3 minutes. If you have a gigabite router, you need a gigabite card. My on board Intel 10/100, did not interfere with this install. Was a breeze. Bob...UPDATE 10/22..Inrel onboard was still set to run. Did not interfere with gigabite card, but I went into bios and turned it off, rebooted, everything fine.

The next day I mustered the courage to plug it in again, and while it did get hot (REALLY HOT) it didn't melt any further and I didn't smell any more smoke.On the low-power setting, you can't run more than one laptop or a couple small things without it overheating...don't even try to run anything less than a big hair dryer on the high-power setting.All that said...it did run my laptop, charge the camera batteries, charge the cell phones, etc. for the whole 2-week trip.

$REVIEW.: The fit of the case on my iPad 3 was phenomenal - the iPad has not budged since it was first encased :)


Very nifty to handle because it is slim, snug and provides a good grip, not slippery

The red on my white iPad is a great look too.BUT, didn't realize the matte finish could be easily stained


Main reason I'd ordered this was to protect my white iPad from smudges when handled by my kids and their at times grubby hands
The other day the kiddos were coloring some sheets with markers and had hands that were stained - my younger grabbed the iPad with the beautiful red case and a few minutes later there were faint inky patches staining it
Lucky there wasn't a lot of ink on my kid's fingers

Long story short, have to make sure the kids don't repeat this so I'm ending up trying to protect the case now

It did do it's job protecting the iPad but I didn't expect to want to replace an expensive case so soon because it has started looking dirty.Would have loved to give 4.5 stars if I could because it met all my requirements perfectly except for this one that my nitpicky self cannot ignore.Also, if anyone is looking to buy this, it would be prudent to look at its few bucks more expensive buddy, the Rotating iPad 2/3/4 case, Detour 360 by Devicewear that lets you swivel the iPad 360 degrees.

$review_text.: This pack is very nice for a cost of only $40.  The quality is more than I'd expect for such a bag.  Normally, I'd expect to pay at least $70 for something like this.Despite how much I like it, I do wish a couple of things were different:1) The inserts provided (the two large ones) aren't really customizable to my needs.  They are stiff and set up so you have no choice about where in the pack your camera body sits.  I'd prefer to have my body sitting a little lower in the pack.2) The addition of a system to hold a monopod would be awesome.  If on the outside of the bag, perhaps on one side, a little hook at the bottom to rest the peg of a monopod, and a strap to secure the upper portion snugly to the bag.There are three slots inside one of the compartments for memory cards.  It's a nice idea, though I think I'd rather have a small  plastic case to protect my memory cards.The pack sits very nicely on my shoulders.  I can walk around with it on one shoulder, and it doesn't feel at all like it would slide off.  Other packs I have/used would slide, and I'd have to constantly adjust them.  This one doesn't move.I think you can't find a better bag for this price.Some have complained about having the Canon logo on it, worrying about thieves being drawn to it.  Boo hoo.  Everything has a logo on it; get over it.

$REVIEW.: So people don't really understand how to review certain items.  This item is a 5-star for many reasons and a 1-star for one... but since the 1-star part is very easy to fix it remains a 5-star.5-star:Sound is amazing.  These guys are loud, really make it so you can't hear other people talk (you can still get the sense that they are talking but it doesn't interfere with the listening).  And the quality of the sound and bass are both very good.Price is amazing.  We are talking $6 with prime shipping.  Forget about it.Comfort is amazing.  These guys hop in your ear, stay in there through a 5mile run with no thoughts of popping out.  And they stay there with little weight, I mean you barely even feel them.  So comfy.1-star:They are made to fall apart.  Fortunately, superglue has been invented.  The casing that covers the area where you plug in the jack started sliding up the cord day two.  I superglued it and it now works perfectly.  The left ear bud fell into two pieces day 12.  I superglued it and now it works perfectly.  I assume the right will do the same eventually.  And I will superglue that too.Overall:So if you want a set of headphones that cost $6 and sound better than anything in the sub $50 range, and are more comfy, and stay in better... but require superglue... these are the headphones for you.  Even when these break after a few more months, as they very well may, I will but another.  $6 for a product that lasts 6 months and you lose in under a year anyway?  Great deal.

$review_text.: I thought I had arrived at true Nirvana when I bought my Logitech cordless, optical mouse last year
It was a great combination of features and reliability, with the only real drawback being the need to change batteries in the mouse about once a month (whereas the keyboard needs new cells about twice a year!)

Now along comes the MX700, with an improved optical engine for even greater accuracy, an extra programmable side button (I used my single side button for &quot;Internet page back&quot;; the 2nd button now works well for me as a &quot;home&quot; shortcut) and best of all, a cradle to recharge the batteries and avoid the one drawback I had found with the original mouse


This is truly Nirvana.

They are intended to be used with3M Easy Trap Flip Holder, 4 x 23 Inches, Black (59247)but may be used with other dust mops.The clothes are tacky and sticky

While I like this quality, there are two downsides: (1) The clothes pick up some dust & debris but not all, and (2) If you use them with your hands, you end up with tacky & sticky DIRTY hands.Right now, I'm using the clothes to dust and clean baseboards


Overall, it does a good job

Peek is gone, out of business - and it happened not long after the "new" Peek came out


 I formerly mentioned going to their website, good support, etc
but all of that's gone now


The site doesn't work anymore either (formerly getpeek.com).This might be an ok toy for a kid but I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars for it.------------I don't know the background on the cause, but I can tell you that Peek Pronto devices NO LONGER WORK


 I don't know why it's still for sale

 There is a problem with the network or something, and they're useless.I'm a (former) loyal Peek user


I loved the email and texting capabilities and bought a lifetime version


 It's now a paperweight, and has to be replaced with new hardware before it will work again - I haven't decided yet if it's worth the expense and hassle
 They've got great service, very friendly customer support, and I like the device itself, but this is extremely frustrating


There's a little more detail on the Peek discussion boards at their website

 I do like the device, but wanted to warn people not to buy THIS specific one
 Order the Peek9, if you want a Peek.

$REVIEW.: I just bought the Logitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black).This new laser mouse works great like I'd expect from a logitech laser mouse.I use it in a business environment on a standard mouse pad, so I can't comment on its hyper-sensitivity (or lack of if that were the case) for gaming, also I can't comment on its effectiveness in peculiar situations such as on my lap, on glass, etc.. since I use it on a mouse pad.The 'unifying' software is awesome... I also have a logitech N305 numeric keypad and both operate on 1 unifying receiver.. WITHOUT any bulky software running in my system tray.Build quality does seem to have decreased from my previous logitech mice.... but that is to be expected during/after a "bad economy".. even successful companies don't "waste a good recession" as an excuse to build things cheaper... (1) the battery cover is thinner, I'm afraid of breaking it.. and (2) the scroll wheel feels cheaper/lighter/less precise.One positive improvement, in addition to the unifying receiver, is the on/off switch on the back which will extend battery life so

Not a big deal the first couple times but slow gets annoying.Tiny, hidden buttons - Power and menu buttons are located on the bottom part of the monitor and are very hard to find. You will get skilled at it but I still have trouble finding the button I need.Inputs face out - The HDMI inputs face outwards instead of down or sideways so you cannot have the monitor flush against a wall.Can't be mounted - Base is connected to the back of the display and wall mounting is not possible.Besides those three, the monitor is fantastic and ideal for gamers looking for a fast response time with powerful HD resolution.

$review_text.: Having waited a long time (2 months from order to delivery) it was with some trepidation that I finally opened the box.Construction:The keyboard tray is very slim, rigid, and feels well constructed. Ironically it's the aluminum outer cover that most lets the case down - while it's very in keeping with the rear of an iPad, that iPad rear is now encased by a well padded plastic case and so the design consistency seems misplaced. In use it's this slippery aluminum face that sits on the table picking up every little scuff and scratch going, so I'm going to have to adhere something to it. The main case body that holds the iPad is thick and perfectly molded, being both easy to install and secure once in place.Setup:iPad settings, bluetooth, pair and you're done. Absolute simplicity.In use:Opening the cover powers on the iPad, and the magnets at the base grip firmly with the keyboard. The most reclined setting works well for me for typical desk typing. The key spacing and action are good enough for my typing accuracy to be completely acceptable, and speed to be not bad at all - and certainly much improved over the onscreen keyboard.All the ports and switches are exposed just as they should be, and the case molding intended to direct sound forward from the speaker actually works very well!The only negative is that aluminum outer face - it tends to slide around on a polished desk and always, always, shows scuffs after use. I'm going to have to find a self adhesive clear film to cover it with. I haven't had a chance to check the battery life claims so can't comment if it does indeed seem to run forever between charges.Very pleased so far!

Net result is more bulk in my bag that carrying stock MacBook and iPad adapter separately.  I have stopped to use my PlugBug because of this.

$REVIEW.: I must say that when I first pulled out the antenna, I was surprised
It looks like a laminated piece of paper rather than an expensive top of the line antenna

That's where my concerns end
It has an incredibly low profile but picks up every channel and then some for me


I especially liked that it came with velcro so I could easily stick it onto a window.One big tip: the antenna is amplified and the manual suggests using a USB port on your TV to power it
I did this and got terrible reception
I thought the antenna was defective at first


Turns out my TV wasn't outputting enough power to amplify the signal
Once I used the included AC adapter, the antenna worked great

So if you're having an issue with signal strength, try plugging your antenna into a wall rather than a USB port.Update after several months of usage:I continue to have no problem receiving all my local channels
However, I have run into one issue
The antenna comes with two small pieces of velcro so you can hang it up


I put mine on a window

The antenna is apparently just heavy enough to consistently fall down

I've fixed the problem by putting a piece of tape on the top of the antenna.

$review_text.: I was interested in buying a back cover to protect the back of my new iPad 3
While I was searching the net, on Amazon.com I ran across the "Smart case" by i-BLASON

 I checked out the case and the reviews and what most got my attention was that it locked in this smart cover, and the colors they had were a perfect match for my dark gray cover


 After reading the reviews I decided that this is the case I wanted, so I put in order in through Amazon.com

 Within a very short time [approximately 3 days] I received the back cover in the mail
I snapped the cover on the back of my "I - pad 3" and I was immediately satisfied with the form and function of this product.1
 The fit was perfect and it looked great.2
 I really like the way it lacked in the smart cover, and prevented the cover from unexpectedly coming off.All in all, I definitely would recommend this cover for the iPad 3.

$review_text.: This camera costs roughly half as much as a Foscam, and does essentially the same thing. However, it's the kind of device that is so obviously cheaply made, you feel like you paid too much for it even at half the price. The picture quality through the (apparently) plastic lens is terrible. Everything looks like an abstract watercolor painting. There is no audio in/out on the back. There is a bright green flashing LED on the front, so forget the idea of this being an unobtrusive camera for a baby's room or some kind of secure area.If you're in the market for an IP camera, just get a Foscam. You won't miss anything if you pass on this one.

$review_text.: This battery is about 2x the size of the original and Win XP battery meter shows that it lasts about the same amount of time. but i gotta tell ya - it seemed to last longer to me. Now although the size is larger and it adds a little weight to it - the battery sticks out further and curves down, allowing the bottom of the netbook to be lifted and exposed to air - thus keeping it cooler.  the original battery being lower and flush with the bottom of the laptop practically laid flat on a table. This battery gives it a little raise off the table. it came packaged well, delivered early and was exactly as described. Two thumbs up and no complaints at all.

$review_text.: I ordered this item after a series of tornadoes passed through our area. They seemed to spring up without much warning and unless you were watching the local weather channel you weren't aware of anything more then a thunderstorm on the horizon.I found this unit easy to set up, and small enough that I was able to easily find a spot to put it. You can either use regular AA's, or if you stick in NiMh or NiCad batteries it can charge them (a nice touch). Once you've got power you just visit an NOAA website and it tells you which of six radio frequencies to listen in on, and what code indicates your exact geographic area.You can then proceed to disable certain alerts (avalanches, icebergs, etc.) or enable others. The one I cared about, tornadoes, is always on regardless.Within an hour or so of setting it up we got an alarm sound and when I pressed the Listen button I got a weather alert about a hailstorm in the area. The storm missed us, but we were still glad we called the pets in and flipped on the TV.This radio does exactly what I wanted and I thought the price was very reasonable. I recommend it to anyone in tornado territory.

$REVIEW.: The backlight leakage on this monitor is about  of the previous 2 monitors ( Asus MS248H 23.6-Inch & ViewSonic VX2439WM 24-Inch ) that I bought.One problem is that the vertical viewing angle could be better. Although, it is better than the previous 2 monitors that I bought.The colors, brightness, & contrast ratio are great. I use the Nvidia control panel to control everything. I use the following website to set everything, especially the Gamma: "lagom.nl/lcd-test/gamma_calibration.php".Paid $194.56 total. Purchased on 02-28-2011 from Fry's Electronics, Woodland Hills, CA.

Dell's monitors were one of our considerations, but we just weren't sure, until we were able to physically compare them side by side with other HDMI monitors. This monitor came home with us because of its crisp and clear images.Installation was a snap. The HDMI cable is the only we had to hook up. Set up was easy and we were up in running in no time! I have NO complaints about our choice. The screen is adjustable and the picture quality is phenomenal - making it perfect for everyday use as well as gaming and viewing movies.

$REVIEW.: Got one of these for a 32 inch HDTV that I wanted to connect a separate VCR and DVD Player to, and also from time to time a laptop computer (the HDTV works as a computer monitor also) and video games for the kids. Basically the unit does what the ad says. It has 4 sets of INPUT jacks (RCA and S Video), 3 sets on the back and 1 set on the front, and 1 set of OUTPUT jacks (also RCA and S Video). Wired it up and it works fine with one minor (to me) exception, and that is I cannot get the MODE to change (the MODE button is supposed to let you manually select the input for the TV, or set it on automatic, or set it on scan). Mine came already set to automatic and it works fine, but I would just like the option of setting it to manual. 4 stars. Would buy again if needed.

$REVIEW.: I recently bought 2 extra monitors, ( theViewsonic VA1938WA-LED 19-Inch Widescreen LED Monitor) for a 3-display setup with my late 2008 13.3" Macbook. Connected 2 Kensington Universal Multi-display Adapters to my USB hub and it worked like a charm! Very easy setup! Yes, with the included base the monitors do tilt downward and can't really be adjusted. But to get around this (and also make more room in my workspace) I also purchased a dual monitor desk-mount stand, ( theMonoprice 3-Way Adjustable Tilting DUAL Desk Mount Bracket for LCD LED (Max 33Lbs, 10~23inch) - Black). PERFECT!

$review_text.: I'm running Snow Leopard and the disc that ships with this product wasn't readable.  Microsoft's site had the newest download, which I believe was version 7.1, the product came with 5.x (disc is in the trash, otherwise I'd look if it mattered - point is, s/w didn't work).  Downloaded the current version, played with the settings (there are a LOT of settings, the scroll speed was defaulted super slow, which might be nice if I was a little kid or had poor motor control, but out of the box, it was kind of frustrating, until I read the directions and it suggested I might look at the settings.  Good tip.  Thanks Microsoft.)  For the price point, it's a really good deal.  It's not the world's greatest keyboard, but it works and is comfortable, and above all, it's vastly preferable to the POS that Apple ships with the iMac.  I like the mouse a lot, it's pretty comparable to the Logitech's I usually prefer (but are rarely paired with a wireless keyboard for $25).

Fortunately my book light arrived with an extra pair of batteries (as well as a carry pouch) but as of yet I haven't had to replace them. I made sure to order extra batteries to have on hand once I need them as I love to read in bed at night and wouldn't want to be stuck without this wonderful light while I wait for new batteries to be delivered.

$REVIEW.: The setup on these devices was extremely simple, and so far they appear to have solved the problem that we had with weak wireless signals to one part of our house.  One of the units (the one connected to a router) indicates that the network speed is 100 Mbps or greater; the other one (connected to a computer at a distant part of our house) shows a red LED, indicating that the link is less than 50 Mbps.  But the computer on the latter unit seems speedy enough on the Internet.  Besides, Comcast only delivers 6 Mbps to our house, so anything above that should be adequate.The included CD is not necessary for setting up these devices; you can even change the default encryption by pushing buttons on the individual units.UPDATES:  November/December 2011I needed to expand my home network, so I ordered two more of these devices.  Big "gotcha" here.  The ones now selling have exactly the same model number as before, but they are "version 2" and incompatible with the older version.  This inexcusably misleading labeling comes from Netgear, not Amazon, but in any case, consider yourself warned.  Don't assume that the adapters currently for sale are compatible with the "same" model that you bought a year or two ago.  If you want to expand an older network that used this model, you'll have to start over from scratch.  Incidentally, the newer version no longer includes a CD, so if you want the software to monitor your network, you'll have to download it from Netgear's website.After purchasing the new version of this product, I attempted to write a review of it, but Amazon disallowed my submission on the grounds that I had already reviewed it!  This simply confirms that Amazon is treating version 1 and version 2 as the same thing, when in fact they are different and mutually-incompatible products.

$REVIEW.: This is a truly fantastic camera for anyone who it a klutz. I brought this to take with me for field work in geology knowing it would take a beating, as did one other person. We both dropped our cameras a LOT. Into streams, into snow, onto ice, onto very hard rocks, etc... and it works just as well as the day I bought it and barely has a scratch. It has many easy to use features and settings, such as a very straightforward and easy panorama setting. I can easily stitch together a panorama in Photoshop, but this actually works better since you don't lose any information and there's less distortion. I rarely use the different modes on my point and shoots because they're such a pain to get to, but on this camera it is surprisingly easy.I also was able to bring this snorkeling several times and got some really nice pictures of fish and coral. The camera didn't leak at all. I love that I can get this camera a little muddy or anything like that and just wash it off. Also love that after I let little kids play with it who put it in their mouths and spill things on it I can spray it down with something and clean it.My two gripes are that the battery life isn't great, but I bought another battery to use with it for extremely cheap so it's not a huge issue, just mildly annoying. My other gripe is the fact that it uses an XD card rather than SD. I know it's a brand thing, but it's still fairly annoying since they aren't as easy to get.However, other than that I really like this camera. I've taken some really nice photos with it. I'm a professional photographer, but I do not want to lug a giant DSLR everywhere. Is this camera as good as that one? Of course not. But it's a great little point and shoot with a lot of really convenient features. I would definitely recommend this camera, especially for anyone who plans to take their camera outside, drops their camera a lot, or just anyone who is clumsy or has kids playing with their kids a lot.

The Chromecast seemed like a goot solution at the right price.The TV handgs on the wall, so I used the included extention to connect it to the back of the TV so that the dongle does not stick out and does not hit the wall.  I plugged the Chromecast into the outlet, and did the setup on my Android tablet.  From opening the box to using it tool me less than 10 minutes.  I tried Netflix and Youtube and both work great.  However, casting a streaming video from a Chrome browser from a netbook did not work well at all.

$REVIEW.: I heard great things about this flash so I decided to try one out. I have a Sony Nex-6 and plan on getting a Sony A7. I also had a sony 58am and just sold my 43am. I was using the sony flash with a hotshoe adapter. This flash is fully manual and can also be triggered by on camera flash. The problem I was having with the sony flash is they all overheat and while this does not happen to me often, there are times I need to use some power and that makes the sony overheat very fast. I was going to get the new 60m multi shoe sony flash but it cost almost 500.00 and from what everyone is saying it overheats worse than any sony flash ever made. This flash cost me about 60.00 and save me tons of money. The new 60m flash has a gn of 60 and this 58 so they are very close in power output for a fraction of the cost. The build quality is actually pretty decent and does not feel overly cheap. I just purchased another one I love it so much. I may even replace my nikon sb-28's with a few of these. I will miss the ttl features of the sony flash but to be honest, I don't find much if any difficulty with shooting manual at all. After a while you just kinda know what setting to put it on. I also shoot raw and tend to over expose just a little. I find that editing them later the pics come out more to my liking than if they were under exposed or just right. This just goes to show what I always believed and that is photography equipment is grossly overpriced hence a certain person selling a piece of plastic for 80.00 for example. I also forgot to mention there is no lock on this flash head which make it easy to switch from portrait to landscape, makes me not miss my sony flash excellent quick bounce feature as much. You can also use this flash with any other sony camera with the old minolta shoe with a simple adapter. Overall excellent flash so far.

$REVIEW.: I always listen to music and you gotta admit this is one very good MP3 player from Transcend. This company is basically a maker of very reliable flash drives and media cards. I happen to own a few of their memory cards and they are very reliable. This also goes to show with this MP3 player. One look and you would otherwise think that its an expensive gadget. It looks very good with the mirrored metal body. Functions are very user-friendly, it will not take you a long time to familiarize yourself with the functions.  The 1.8-inch colored screen is very sharp and delivers very good video. I tried downloading some video and the quality is just plain amazing.  It comes equipped with an FM radio, a digital voice recorder, an FM recorder and a clock that displays different time zones.  Transferring music is also a breeze. I mainly use Realplayer to manage my digital music and it's a no-brainer. It is very compact much like the Sandisk Sansa e260 that I currently own. But the T.sonic 840 beats the Sansa it is ease of use. The buttons are perfectly situated where you want them to be. Sound quality is another awesome feature for this MP3 player. Use it with a very good noise-canceling headphones and you will just plain drift away to your own paradise. The only thing I wish for this MP3 player to have accessories (like an AC charger or a cigarette-lighter charger) readily available. I've search the web for some accessories and I couldn't find any. Maybe since being fairly new, not a lot of available accessories are out there compare to an Ipod or a Sansa. Overall, this is one MP3 player that is solidly built and I will be using it for a long time.
$SUMMARY.: GREAT MP3 PLAYER! GIVES OTHER 4 GIG PLAYERS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY!

$REVIEW.: These are great.  The sound quality is awesome, the price is reasonable, the microphone works awesome and I never have to repeat myself, but the one small complaint I do have is that the placement of the button which controls the &#34;surround sound&#34; is a little wonky.  If you walk away from the computer and set the headphones face down, you will almost always come back to the button having been pressed, toggling the surround sound.  It's a very minor concern, and not something I'm willing to remove a star for, but it makes me laugh that no one caught it during the design.

$review_text.: This lens is a great addition to any m4/3 kit.  I've used this lens for everything from shooting birds to shooting concerts and it very infrequently lets me down.My copy of the lens is sharp even at 200mm.  Wide open sharpness and contrast are very similar to an older, non-IS version of the Canon 70-200mm f2.8L lens when shot wide open.  To be fair, the Canon is a much better lens overall.  If the Canon lens is stopped down a little, it has a better image.  But wide open vs wide open, the Panasonic 45-200mm holds its own!I've also compared this lens to the Panasonic 45-150mm.  The 45-150mm may be just a tad sharper, but for all practical purposes they are very similar in image quality.  Personally, I like the extra 50mm of reach that the 45-200 gives you.The lens is a little bit large when compared to other m4/3 lenses, but to me, it has a nice solid feel.I have no regrets about purchasing this lens.  It's very practical, offers great value and great image quality.
$SUMMARY.: Very useful length zoom with great image quality

$REVIEW.: I've used this brand before in another project for my apartment, and it was nice to see it available on Amazon.  As other have already said, this is great for the consumer to hide cords in homes or apartments.  I've used it for my big screen TV, cable TV routing, and also in my apartment where I have converted a 2nd bedroom into a home office, and the wall outlets where on the other side of the room.  The only advice I can give, that hasn't already, is that if you have baseboard heating, you will also want to screw in the Wiremold to a stud every once in a while because the heat from the baseboard heaters does tend to let the double stick tape come loose.

$REVIEW.: Let me get this straight first off: I love these. The best headphones I've owned in a long time. Can't beat the price, either.Now, I will say that the levels are pretty low. As others have said, you've got to have your computer's volume up a bit more than some other headphones. Definitely not a huge problem, but it makes switching from headphones to speakers fun. Also they don't isolate noise as well. Not a deal breaker for me, but it may be for some.What I love about these: Long cable (Maybe 10 feet), great sound quality, and they're very comfortable. And I only paid $21 for them! Can't beat that.

$REVIEW.: I've had my new reader for over a month now and have noticed that I enjoy reading more and read more than ever

Even though its out of pocket costs to begin seems much, but can one put that same thought to the cost of a tree? Like others, I've read about this model and the kindle for hours to find out which is best
Truly one needs to decide that what are their own needs and what is available to either machine in the books that they read


I also don't want to have the instant buy function since one can truly be broke in buying books


If you look hard enough, sometimes they are cheaper off site sony and amazon, even free

The pdf files are easily transferred and read

Many of my professors have begun using pdf files instead of textbooks and there are many text books that are designed for the reader, not all
I've found that the buttons are in the right position for page turning with no accidental pushes
The battery life didn't seem to last the 7000 pages claimed is my one gripe but I've only had to charge it once in the last month of reading
I read every day.

I connect it to my Mac Pro via HDMI and use it for working with two screens. The resolution quality is definitely not going to be confused with an Apple retina display, but being able to blow up a spreadsheet for review or show 2-pages of a document at that same time is a huge time-saver for me. That leaves email on my smaller screen and I can work much more efficiently. The colors need to be adjusted out of the box, but I was able to get them &#34;right&#34; after some minor fiddling. Great display for the money...

$REVIEW.: This little XBOOM speaker is impressive.  Like I said in the title it sounds louder than a Jambox.  Even more impressive is at full volume there is very little distortion.  From watching the video, it sounded like there was a lot of distortion but there was not.  Full volume is very usable.  This speaker is loud enough you have to speak up to talk over it.  Not bad for a tiny little speaker barely bigger than a golf ball.Another thing I was concerned about with this speaker is that it is mono (the headphone plug is stero, however, so I am guessing the mono speaker is playing both channels).  However, in listening to it side by side with the Jambox,  I really did not notice any difference .  The Jambox speakers are so close together you really don't get much of a stereo effect.This speaker is compatible with anything which uses a standard headphone jack.  So anything that uses headphone will work with this little gem.  It also has a stowable little cord that allows you to daisy chain the speakers together.  I am not really sure how useful this feature is and I don't ever see myself using it.  The reason for this is volume as measured in dB is an exponential function so doubling speakers doesn't dramatically increase you volume.  A move from 10dB to 20dB is 10 times more volume not 2 so you would need 5 speakers to go up 10dB and then 50 to go up another 10.  Also, putting 2 speakers together is not going to give you a stereo sound.For me, little touches go along way in a quality product.  One of the nice little touches with this speaker is there is a velcro rap for the cord that is attached to the cord.  So when you unplug the cord you can wind it up and velcro it.  The construction is first rate and there are neat little touches on the aesthetics which just make it nice to look at.This speaker is powered by an included rechargeable battery.  The battery is charged off a standard USB plug.  Please note this wire only includes a power line off the USB port.  You would not be able to use this cord for transferring data.  This speaker also has a volume control but I would just recommend leaving it at full and using your device to control the volume.  What I think would be more useful would be a left and right channel bias switch.  That way if you daisy chained two speakers together you could bias one left and one right and have stereo sound.The only con to this speaker is an item which would not be expected in this price range; that is blue tooth.  I enjoy pairing my Jambox with my computer and then carrying it around with me as I work.  I also like the ability to use it as a speaker phone.  Very nice features but they are pricy.  With this you have to have you device physically plugged in.Overall, this is a fantastic and very useful little speaker.  It is louder than my Jambox.  And to my untrained ear, the quality of the sound is equal.I was supplied a sample for evaluation and promised to provide a honest review.

The UEFI instead of BIOS is amazing
Full GUI and mouse support is leaps and bounds beyond what we remember BIOS to look like.The only things I have to mention on the negative side is this:In UEFI, the RAM MHz was set to Auto, however my 1866Mhz RAM wasn't automatically adjusted

Had to manually pick the right MHz


Also, BE AWARE this motherboard only has ONE 3-pin for a case fan
Most cases have at least two fans, one in the front and one in the back
Easily is fixed by using a molex to 3-pin adapter
Luckily I had one extra to use.**If you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I will answer to the best of my abilities**

$REVIEW.: This drive enclosure is one of the higher quality cases I have purchased. From what I can tell, it appears to be made from solid aluminum, with the front and back in plastic. Installation, and setup was easy, there were no extra drivers or software to install just plug-n-play.A few things I dislike about the unit are; there is no fan. This is not a big deal unless you are going to access the drive repeatedly for a several hours. When the hard drive itself is being accessed there is a lot of heat the builds up, but when you just have it plugged in idling there is no problem. The USB cable provided for data transfer has two Male plugs, which I suspect is for users with computers without USB 2.0. I had no problem using a regular USB cable I had laying around instead of the provided one, so this is not an issue for 90% of computers out there. My final issue, is the directions or somewhat vague, there is very little support provided in the booklet. A reminder for anyone not tech-savvy, the hard drive you are using with this device must be formatted. If you purchased a brand new hard drive, or intent to use a new one you need to format it. I work with computers a lot and it slipped my mind at first (it is also not mentioned in the instructions).Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Can't beat Amazon's prices.

$REVIEW.: Shop around and you can get it for half this price.I've had this for a couple of years, it still powers on OK, however it won't stay locked on to the signal. I live in the San Francisco Bay area, so radio reception should be no issue, yet each time I come back to the car the thing has lost lock again and I have to power it down so it can restart. It will run for a few minutes, or half an hour, before it drops off again. So much for realtime traffic information.The price is ludicrous, this thing should be thirty bucks at the very most. Knowing what I do now I'd think more than twice before I'd buy anything that used this receiver again.UpdateAfter several years of using this thing it looks like the software and systems guys have sorted their act out. This seems to have become more reliable. There was a terrible patch where the thing pretty much stopped working, about the same time as there was some discussion of ClearChannel having messed up the traffic reporting, and then it came good. No idea what happened. There was a software update which didn't mention anything that should have affected this. Anyway, it works well enough, just pay the extra five bucks for the lifetime subscription that doesn't include adverts.The traffic information delivered still isn't fantastic though.11/2010 update:After paying the one-time lifetime buyout on the traffic information the darned thing quit working. I have a service request in with Garmin to see if it can be repaired or replaced. I wouldn't pay their price though, I'd be better off buying one elsewhere for forty bucks and paying the traffic again. I have three different GPS options on my Android phone but two of them don't work outside of phone coverage and the third is unreliable, it frequently just refuses to start. My car pool buddy of eight years and I have come to the conclusion that for our 100 mile per day commute nothing works like a dedicated GPS with good traffic info.

They are extremely comfortable and within a few secondsare no longer noticeable in my ears, providing a truly vivid presence for the music.Classical, jazz, country, pop, and all other genres are brightly projected with a remarkablesensation.As must be expected, very low frequency organ notes are hardly there, but the rest of thespectrum is crisp, sharp, and puts you right there in the midst of the sound source.An exceptional buy.

$REVIEW.: Item works great, I've charged my Samsung Galaxy S3 once already. I chose size and convenience over capacity, and think the decision was right. I ran multiple apps while charging the phone, no problem. Of course, since the smartphone was on and being used, it took a bit longer and ran the Anker down further as a result, but that was expected.

$REVIEW.: I put this in at my townhouse because tenants were complaining about my previous access point not having great speed/range


Complaints dropped to zero when I put this in..


I get a strong signal everywhere in my townhouse and even walking across the street into other buildings


It broadcasts on so many different frequencies that all of my devices are compatible with it and get incredibly fast speeds on my LAN.

$REVIEW.: This charger offered here (Rayovac Platinum AA/AAA/C/D/9V Universal Battery Charger) is the PS20PL. It is inferior to the original Rayovac PS3 Universal Smart Battery Charger in many ways:- The PS20PL is a timer-based dumb charger. It blindly charges all batteries for 8.5 hours and shuts off, regardless of their capacity or status. It is up to you to remove your batteries after certain number of hours to avoid over-charging. The PS3 is a smart charger that monitors each cell during charging, and stops automatically when each cell is full.- The PS20PL forces you to charge in pairs (either 2 or 4 cells). The old PS3 charges batteries individually, which is the only way to ensure each battery is charged to its correct capacity.- The PS20PL can only handle NiMH and NiCd batteries. The old PS3 can handle NiMH, NiCd, and rechargeable alkaline manganese (RAM) batteries.On the other hand, both PL20PL and PS3 suffer from the following deficiencies:- The maximum battery capacity is limited to 3000mAh. That means they cannot fully recharge higher capacity C and D cells, such as theTenergy Centura C Size Low Self-Discharge Rechargeable Batteries(4000mAh).- The AC transformer inside is bulky, heavy, and limited to 110V supply only.Instead of this PS20PL, you should get a smarter universal charger that can handle larger capacity batteries. For example, consider theTenergy Advanced Universal Charger TN190. The TN190 added a REFRESH function and a LCD battery status display. It is able to work from 100-240V AC, and can handle higher-capacity batteries up to 10,000mAh.

$review_text.: This product works well for its intended purpose, but you really have to think about if this is the right solution for your needs before purchasing such an expensive product
 Chances are if you are considering a product at this price, you've already thought of the "how am I going to control my source components?" question, or it doesn't apply to you because you'll be using this unit in the same room as your components
 Yes, it sends PERFECT quality HD video wirelessly without dropouts or interference
 But if you are planning on using this product to send A/V wirelessly from one room to another, think about how you are going to control your components first.If your source components and the TV (or other target device) are in the same room, no problem
 If your components will be in another room, you won't be able to control them unless they use BlueTooth (like the PS3) or you have an IR repeater/blaster.That being said, the product is impressive

 I do not notice any difference between the quality at the source or the target when sending the signal wirelessly with this product


 I have this unit connected to my Onkyo A/V unit in my living room and using an HDMI splitter, I have the output connected to both this product and my TV


 The receiver part of this product is attached to my TV in another room

 This allows me to play PS3 games and watch Blu-Ray movies in this second room which I couldn't do without this product (props to SONY for their BlueTooth remote and controllers)
 The only thing I can't do is change channels or anything else on my DirecTV DVR since the remote is IR and I don't have anything to blast the signal from the second room to the receiver yet.This unit comes with two HDMI inputs and two component inputs


 I don't understand why they even bother with the two component inputs
 Anyone looking at this technology and willing to spend some bucks on it most likely isn't using component A/V anymore


 Maybe ONE component input would be ok, but TWO?  I haven't tried the component output on this
 I'd imagine the signal received is identical to the output like it is on the HDMI side.This is a great product if it fits your needs

 If everything will be in the same room, and you just want to avoid the sight of wires or running wires through the wall, then you can't go wrong

 If your components are in a separate room, just make sure you have a way to control them before thinking about a product like this.

It never ceases to amaze me that people believe that there is a difference in sound quality when it comes to fiber optic cables. A bitstream is a bitstream.. it cannot be corrupted unlike copper wiring or wireless connections. You pay $50, I'll pay $10, and we're both going to be listening to the same 5.1 channel bliss. :)Btw.. the same goes for HDMI cables.. spend $5-$10..not $30-$100 for a 3-6' cable.

$REVIEW.: I haven't used them yet, they were just delivered 30 minutes ago. It is certainly some nice packaging, and the headset feels great on my head, Looks great also. So I pproceeded to read the manul and install the battery. Thast took me quite some time. The manual (in englsh) shows how to do it but it wasn't easy. I finally got it open with just a little help from an outside object. Inserted the battery, replaced the cover and it promptly feel off. OK, put it back and used a little more force and it stayed closed. I have them charging now and will update the report after I get some use from them. It has a neat little storage bag, with an inside pocket - but the zipper on that pocket broke when I went to use it. Only 2 stars for the frustration so far, and I haven't even tried to pair with my iPad. It could go up, or it could go down...Paired flawlessly with my iPad and iPhone. Great sound, and once I figured which buttons were for the volume it got even better. 3 stars nowof course they have to pass the test of time

$review_text.: I love my Kindle Fire and take it with me everywhere

I pop it in and out of my purse at storytime, the Y, the doctor's office..
anywhere and everywhere


Case Logic's case is sturdy, well-made, classy looking, and easy to clean, and I'll definitely be using it anytime I'm packing my Kindle Fire in preparation for a serious beating
But it doesn't provide the kind of instant, easy access to my Kindle that I like for everyday use
Not only does it require two hands and a concerted effort to get the Kindle out of the case, but the Velcro flap is really loud


That Velcro opening sound was really cool on my 80's Trapper Keeper, but not so much now when I want to sneak my Kindle out at the back of a too-long meeting and instead end up causing every head in the room to turn.Anyway, while I recommend this case for frequent travelers and other folks who are rough on their Kindles, it has limited use for me

For everyday storage, I much prefer the soft-sidedBUILT Kindle Fire Slim Neoprene Sleeve Case, Lush Flower, which I've owned for a couple of months and absolutely love

It's cute, protects my screen from scratches and dirt, and, most importantly, lets me get at my Fire quickly and easily
That, in my opinion, is a must.

$REVIEW.: I started loving Samsung quality several years ago when I bought my first LCD tv. Like my first one, this TV has a great picture with good color representation (which is what I REALLY care about). I wish TVs had an audio out ports and the sound produced by these sets is less than adequate. Our TV lives in our master bathroom and plays a lot of Netflix shows. However, I use it to listen to Pandora radio. it is adequate for my wife's Netflix shows, but unsatisfying for music. That said, sound quality is not the bone I want to pick. I wasn't expecting great sound so I can't really complain too much in that regard. My complaint is its inability to auto-switch screen resolution. My much older Samsung does this. When it plays a standard def program, it switches into standard def mode. This set does not. I figured that feature has been around for a long time and would show up on this set, but no. Very annoying feature lack on an otherwise top quality TV.

$REVIEW.: These sleeves are pretty much the standard for most people.  Over the years, I have gone through various brands and styles but this one is the one that seems to pop up the most often in stores or with the best price.Pros: Really crystal clear.  I've used other brands which are slightly hazy, but these will show you just about 100% of the color and detail of the original negative.Cons: The sheets are a little too soft, and also each slot is very tight.  So it is harder to slip in negatives with ease and you really have to struggle sometimes to get it in properly.  The white strip at the top is nice for labeling, but is also hard to write on.  A ballpoint or sharpie will both do it, but you'll need to practice a couple times to get it on there smoothly.  Also tends to push against the plastic, resulting in a bit of a relief on the other side.The Beseler brand sheets, though they seem of a "crappier" quality, are very easy to load in and out of the sleeves.  Also crystal clear, and of a slightly more rigid material.  I almost think I like those better, though there is nothing particularly wrong with these sheets.

I was wishful thinking at best. Seriously, my Apple earbuds sound better than this thing. Even the packaging looks cheap and gimmicky.The features are nice and work well, but in the end, I think sound quality is the most important factor. Sennheiser really missed the mark. I mean really missed it, man. These should be priced at most $199, even then I don't know if I could accept the hollow sound.The SRS WOW HD feature is horrible, and the noise cancellation is not nearly as good as you get with Bose.I returned this set and replaced it with a Bose QC15. I couldn't be more pleased with the Bose.  The sound is great, the noise cancellation is like being locked in a vault full of pillows, and the design is much cleaner. Save a step and go straight for the Bose QC15.The Sennheiser MM 550 is way overpriced for what you get.

$review_text.: I have enjoyed the system since installing it in my car. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the unit and am very satified with the results. Is easy to use and works great with an Ipod and the tagging feature is really cool. Some of the feedback details that ones preset radio stations can be a little difficult to scan through with the dial. I do not see this as cumbersome. If you use the remote to scran through FM preset stations it is quite easy. I use the remote for most general functions without an issue. Unless you are a car stereo enthusist this is a great system for just every day use that will provide great sound with a easy to use features (USB, Ipod, preset stations, tagging, hd radio, and don't forget the fun colors you can create). I would recommend this system to anyone looking for an alternative to their factory system. And best of all you can't beat the price. Lastly, it is really easy to install in yourself. I had never installed a car stereo in my life, but googled how to do it, there is a lot of how-to info online. Purchased the installation materials for less than $40 on Amazon. It tool less than 1.5hrs to install, and presto, looks like it was installed in the factory. You can save $100 dollars and DIY.

$REVIEW.: I have been looking for a great, large passive 3D TV.  All the specs on this look great, except for the 120Hz refresh rate and edge-lit LED with a funky local dimming feature.  I decided to go check it out in person at Best Buy.  I found one on display near me and noticed it had a dead pixel blue band running down the left side of the screen.  It's not really noticeable at first because the rest of the picture looked great.  So, I decided to go to another Best Buy about 15 miles away to get a good view of the screen.  Lo and behold, the demo at that Best Buy also had a dead pixel band, green this time, running down the left side of the screen right around the same spot.I am now very weary of buying this TV because 1) the screen may not be able to handle one months worth of on-time before the screen goes bad or 2) the TV can't handle the analog input signal properly distributed to Best Buy TVs or 3) there is a manufacturing problem with the screen.I read somewhere that the 65" screen is made by a different manufacturer than the equivalent 55" screen.I am going to hold off on buying this TV until I can find a good, ell QA'd 65" passive 3D TV.  The Vizio didn't get as good reviews as the LG and active 3D glasses are 1) expensive 2) flicker gives me a headache and 3) uncomfortably heavy to wear for an entire movie.

$review_text.: The keyboard has a great feel and very nice keys. Typing is a joy. Battery life is also great (weeks). However, you must slide the little switch to wake it up after it's been off for a few hours and if you slide it and hold it just second to long it goes into discovery mode. Very annoying. Also, every time I power it up the ThinkPad wants to install a new driver, despite the fact I've installed it (twice).

$REVIEW.: This system is good for home.  You are not going to get a great picture, however it does the job. The cameras are not 700tvl but the system can support up to 700. Ensure you get the proper HD to work with this. I used the 2TB purple western digital HD and it works perfectly. 2TB is the largest you can place on these units. Also, do not mount the HD to the case because the DVR will overheat and cause problems quick. I assume I was missing my HD brackets and fabricated my own to lift it a bit. The Zmodo customer service was great on Chat and help me resolve some minor issues. You will have 4 microphone inputs on this as well. This is a great feature and requires additional cables. You do not have many options or motion detection so you will be recording bushes moving. Hope this helps.

$review_text.: I purchased two of these to replace the RAM in my new MacBook Pro


I wanted 8GB of Ram, but did not want to pay Apple $400 for it


So I got this Kingston RAM from Amazon and installed it in about one minute - super easy!If you are running memory intensive applications on your MacBook Pro on anything less than 8GB of RAM, you will likely see a great boost in performance and responsiveness by increasing your total memory

I am running Parallels with Windows 7 and some huge apps including Visual Studio and Mathematica as a VM alongside Mac OSX


With 8GB of RAM these apps run seamlessly and I can switch between a Mac app and a Windows app without any delay
Well worth the money!

$review_text.: I purchased this online for $99 which is fairly marginal. Microsoft wants too much for this puppy. It's extortion I tell you. You can't play HD games unless you buy one and if you buy the flash drive version of the XBOX, you have to pay more for the hard drive. $138? That's bull. And the go price is $299 for 4GB XBOX and $399 for 250GB XBOX ($100 difference)? That's outrageous.

$review_text.: A nice enough keyboard, but takes some work to perfect.Physically the keyboard is a bit smaller than a standard sized keyboard

Keytops are just under 15mm versus just under 16 for my Apple Bluetooth keyboard


The spacing between keys is about 17.5mm versus 19 for my Apple keyboard


 It seems like a good portable size and after I realized it was a bit smaller it gave me no trouble.It is light weight, mine came with the stand and batteries, the special keys (menu, home, back, search) work as expected on a Nexus 7 tablet (with Android 4.2.1)


The top frame is glossy, which doesn't make sense for a portable keyboard.I haven't found some important (to a Unix admin) keys, however: ` (backtick) and [esc] (escape).Option-n gives the opportunity for &ntilde; (option-n n) but if you hit right arrow (or anything that doesn't ever have a ~ over it) afterwards it just gives ~


If you want an accent such as &eacute;, use option-e


This is much like a Mac keyboard


Option-s gives &szlig;

Option-i gives ^


Option-c gives , and finally, option-u gives an umlat (H&auml;v Mt&auml;l).I'll contact Amazon to see if there is a way to get the missing keys, but for now I rate it as 4 stars for most, 1 star if you need any of the missing keys.[Edit] Amazon didn't know but was terrific in all other ways as usual


 However there is hope


^[ for escape seems to work, I'm looking at editing a keyboard layout for GRAVE (backtick) and putting ctrl where CAPS LOCK is.[Edit 2] I edited /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl and was able to turn the caps lock into control, and control into into a grave accent, but creating Vendor_04f2_Product_1109.kl didn't work (I got the numbers from System Profiler on my Mac).Steps, if you have root:sumount -o remount,rw /systemcd /system/usr/keylayoutcp Generic.kl Generic.kl.bakEdit the file to make key 29 GRAVE and key 58 CTRL_LEFT

Or figure out the mapping for, say, option-g.That said, I did get the repeating key problem others have mentioned, and this isn't on a Kindle Fire so I suspect it is the keyboard

 I also had trouble navigating around (e.g
getting to the Send button) but I don't think that is the keyboard
 Finally, getting it to reconnect after turning it off and moving around with the tablet's screen off isn't 100% for me.Regardless of any problems it had, for remoting into systems it will make life much much easier.[Edit 3] It has a lot of trouble reconnecting to my tablet; that plus the repeating key problem mean I'll be returning it


Changing to 3 stars from 4.

My biggest complaint, though, is that when the cord is twisted or bent, my iPod senses that they've come unplugged and pauses itself. It seems there must be loose wires within that disrupt the connection when they lose contact with one another.  I've never had this problem with any of the other headphones I own.

My only beef is that the closure flap makes the thing a little bit more bulky than it has to be. They could have used another magnetic catch to attach the front cover to the main one. Overall, though, I'm very pleased with it. The out-gassing ("bad smell") that some other reviewers have commented on? --- not an issue after you allow it to air out for a few days.

$REVIEW.: As a 43 year old video professional who worked in television (TV master control room) for many years, I tend to be a stickler for higher quality products that deliver both value and performance.  And if these products can be had for less money, well, so much the better.  That is what I was searching for when I researched affordable portable DVD players that don't cost too much.  I did not want to spend more than around two hundred dollars or so, so the Audiovox D1705 grabbed my attention.  I comparison shopped it against a model by Polaroid, Toshiba, Mintek, and a few inexpensive 'off name' brands, and easily came to the conclusion that the Audiovox was easily the best buy, with the best 'track record' picture quality-wise and reliability-wise.  In addition, being able to easily modify the player to become 'region free' (as indicated in a post below) was a big 'plus', which I did with no problems whatsoever.  The actual mod itself took all but one minute, and now I have a portable player that plays DVD's from any region, both domestic and foreign.  It is great to know that I can flawlessly play some of my British rock and comedy DVD's that normally would not play on an American market player, as well as all my North American DVD's!  The picture quality is very good, and you can fast forward with the provided remote.  The audio quality is not that good, but acceptable.  Using small headphones or earphones will provide a much better quality sound.  Keep in mind that most portable DVD players have such tiny built in speakers anyway, such that the audio will be normally compromised.  This is the tradeoff to compactness.  No big whoop. In addition, the player provides a level of features normally found in more expensive players, which is nice.  This encompasses audio and video inputs, outputs, and actual screen menu adjustments for color and hue saturation and levels.  Very nice Audiovox!CAUTION: UPDATE 6/2005It's a shame.  My original, glowing 5 star review needs to be downgraded.  The rechargeable battery this unit comes with is completely worthless after only a few months!  It loses it's capacity quickly, and in my case, completely!  I put the unit in storage, for a few weeks, and charged the battery every 2 weeks, as indicated on Page 30 of the manual.  In short, the unit would not hold any charge when I tried to recharge it last night, and would only play about 3 minutes of a DVD before conking out!  This should NOT happen at all with a new product, and Audiovox clearly needs to improve their battery technology, and send out free, improved batteries to everyone who has this unit.  Again, the unit itself works fine, but the battery is a joke!  I now have a worthless portable DVD player, since I relied on battery operation for my application.  If your unit is experiencing the same problem, and it is fairly new, please write or call Audiovox and demand a new battery that works!Update: 11/2/05It's been months since I wrote Audiovox again, and they never got back to me.  Initially, several months ago they sent me a typical facless corporate response letter after sending them a first letter (I sent 2 total), indicating that they would not send me a new battery unless I paid around $90 for it!  So they want me to give them $$$ to replace a defective battery to begin with!  In addition, their customer service people (at least the ones I spoke to) were extremely rude and one-sided.  They did not at all seem interested that their batteries would not retain a charge, even if the unit was 'babied' and relatively new!!!  I will NEVER deal with Audiovox again. Once they sell you a product, you're 'on your own'!!!

$REVIEW.: Every few years when I upgrade my laptop, or when a laptop decides to die on me (as was the case with a recent motherboard failure on a Toshiba), I repurpose the hard drive as an external.  I've done this several times thus far and typically pick up a cheap case to store the drives in.In this case, the drive was SATA, and I felt it was time to upgrade to the USB 3.0 standard.  At this time my current system doesn't support USB 3.0, but chances are my next system will so I wanted to be forward compatible.Installation of the drive was painless.  I installed the drive and then screwed the two halves of the shell together with the supplied screws.  Mine came with two extra screws just in case, but they weren't needed.  My drive fit perfectly and didn't bounce around, but for a thinner drive you may find it helpful to install a small piece of foam or even cardboard to prevent the drive from flopping around inside.  Just be sure you don't block or cover the vent hole(s) in your HDD.Once the cable is plugged in, the drive powered up and I was able to move files to and from without any issues.  It really is that simple.  There is also a very small white LED indicator light on the drive to let you know it is working - although depending upon the drive you have, you will probably be able to hear it working inside (unless of course you use a SSD).The drive case also came with a protective sleeve to prevent the drive from being scratched - a nice bonus I suppose, but not really a selling point in my perspective.  All my previous drive cases have had similar sleeves and this one is of the same (inexpensive) quality.My prior cases are steel with plastic end caps, so I do like this aluminum case better.  It is light and strong, and the aluminum looks better than cheap plastic.I don't have any major complaints here, but if I must point out one minor quibble it would be the special connector used on the drive end of the cable.  My other drives use standard USB male connectors on both ends of the cable which makes it nice as I don't need to worry about keeping specific cables next to specific drives.  However in this case, I'll need to ensure I don't misplace the cable because it is the only one I have on hand to work with this drive.All things considered this is a good case at a fair price.  It does the job it is supposed to do, and it looks good while doing it.  Hard to complain about that.

$REVIEW.: I may have given it an extra star or 2 if the unit worked as intended. The sound for the money wasn't bad - that said neither was it really good. But for a $130. not so  bad.What caused me to give it only 2 stars - was the fact the optical link didn't work except for the first time I powered the system up. The next time I turned it on - nothing - the optical link was lost. I tried 3 different known good optical cables but still nothing. Calling Vizio was no help - they couldn't figure it out. So I contacted Amazon & 2 days later a replacement unit arrived and low and behold the exact same thing happened. Both units are headed back and I ordered a $600 Sonos sound bar -

It seems to be very well made and I like the look of the leather.  It came in a zip-lock type bag which I'll use when I travel as it will protect my iPad and case at the airport and hopefully hide the fact that there's an iPad in the bag.  I am very satisfied with the case and will definitely recommend it to my family and friends who are all turning to iPads and Apple products.  Right after I received the case I decided I wanted a keyboard case and I ordered that as well.  I plan to use this case when I visit my family and won't be doing any typing.

$review_text.: Well made with quality fabric and dual top flap zippers

The shoulder strap has no padding
It is entirely too large for my SONY SLT-A65VM, and defeats the whole idea of a holster (travel light) camera bag

The bottom partition with velcro attachments seems useless for an SLR equipped with a zoom lens

I thought one of the reviewers wrote that a point and shoot camera was stored in the space, completely hidden in the bottom of the holster

I cannot imagine this to be of very much interest to the general holster consumer
Unfortunately, it had to go back


The Ape Case ACPRO650 is a perfect match for me and it is of equal quality for less cost!

$REVIEW.: I have lab users who have an older laptop with some dedicated hardware that is tough to replace
 They have lost two of their USB ports on it (unsurprisingly, as its a venerable laptop), but wanted to keep it going until they were confident the replacement had all their stuff working

 For $8 and free prime shipping, this was the best solution by a long shot!  Small, discrete little hub has brought them back to having 4 USB ports on their laptop


 No issues with power, but we haven't tried to run anything that draws much off it, like a big USB harddrive or anything.

$REVIEW.: I used these on a 2004 Boxster S with CDR-23 radio

 I was skeptical and almost bought different ones because of the comments about them being flimsy
 I can only speak for my experience of course, and I had zero problems.There are no instructions so let me tell you what I did in case it helps

 They are labeled L and R

 You insert them in their respective sides with the notches facing inwards

 Wiggle it a little as you put them into the slots if it feels blocked


 If all you feel is some resistance then push a little harder


 If it continues to slip in then you are in good shape


 Push until it snaps in place
 When it snaps it will be locked in place until you get the radio out.After getting both tools in I had to yank a few times before the radio finally moved about 0.5in


 After that I could ease it out
 Go slowly to make sure that the wires in back are not hung up on anything.My fingers did not feel great afterwards but I was never concerned about getting cut
 If you want just use some cloth or a rag when you put your fingers in the tool.After getting the radio out you remove the tools by pressing in on the spring loaded piece of metal on the side of the radio


 The tool can be pulled out while you push on the side of the radio


 when the tool comes out you will see how the spring loaded piece of metal holds the radio in.

In the photo it looks as if it could double as a school backpack, and it couldn't.  That's not a drawback for *me*, but I just want to make that clear to a potential buyer. Aside from that, it's very well made, sturdy, and comfortable. It's also a nice alternative to the all too common messenger bag if that's not your style.

$review_text.: I purchased these speakers because I go to a handful of football games where I tailgate with friends and I was looking for a small portable speaker that I could transmit FM radio to from my phone - that means it was key that these can be operated by battery.I've been pleased with these so far


 I haven't put batteries in yet, but in my at-home testing I've been pleased
 Ease of use is great


 Pairing it with my phone was very simple...with the unit turned off just hold down 1 button for a few seconds and it enters pairing mode

 From there I searched for it on my phone and voila, within seconds I was streaming music from my phone
 I also used an audio cable (male to male) going from my MP3 player to these speakers using the "In" jack, and the result was just as good.As for sound quality, these speakers won't blow you away


 The quality is good, considering the price (around $50 or so)


 It doesn't sound overly "tinny" or scratchy as you increase volume

 It can get quite loud, but as you approach max volume the quality noticably deteriorates - as expected...again, these aren't high-end speakers.I got everything I paid for in these speakers, so I'm very pleased
 For me they will only see occasional use, so if you are looking at these as a potential main speaker for music listening, you may want to consider spending more money to get a more complete audio system

 But if you're in the market for something quick and easy with pretty decent sound quality and is extremely portable, I'd highly recommend these speakers.

Not only does it hold the remotes, but there's plenty of room for the other basics that I tend to use and lose amidst the clutter. It's only 5 inches wide so doesn't take up a lot of space, and with everything that fits in it, I have plenty of room for MORE stuff! ;)

$review_text.: This is a very nice little handheld GPS at a good price. However, if you are going to use it for Geocaching or anything else where you would need to stand still and still need to tell where to go, do yourself a favor and step up a notch. This unit does not have a magnetic compass. That means that as soon as you stop moving enough for the GPS to tell which direction you are going in the compass goes haywire and will be pointing in all the wrong directions. If you are going Geocaching standing still right near the cache is very common and you will greatly appreciate having a compass that works while doing so.

$review_text.: I was a sucker and paid $99 at Walmart for this. Amazona has a great price, I bought this one as a gift.Take the battery door off of your camera, insert this grip, screw in and you are ready to go. You can use your original camera battery, or like me I just use rechargeable AA batteries. The package includes an adapter that takes 6 AA batteries so you can skip buying expensive Nikon batteries. The weight of the grip greatly balances out the weight of the lens on the camera. If you are a big guy the grip gives you more area to hold the camera. If you are a girl, well let's be honest now, should you be touching your husband's expensive camera? :)It makes the camera feel balanced in your hand, and easy to hold. I never take it off my Nikon. In fact, I say the camera should be made with a grip. It feels so much better in your hands I don't know why Nikon or Canon doesn't design it in. Every pro photographer out there uses a grip, it's kind of a no brain add on.Just make sure the camera case you plan to buy is big enough to accommodate the bulkier size of the camera+grip.

$review_text.: I've put my Harmony One remote through serious usage over the past 2 years and I'm pleased to report that the device has held up very well over this duration (has even survived numerous drops on tile and hardwood surfaces).  If you've been on the fence for awhile now debating whether or not to take the plunge and upgrade to a 'premium' universal remote your timing couldn't be better with the reduced pricing on what used to be a 249 dollar device.  Anyone who uses their home entertainment setup on a near daily basis will soon find the purchase worthwhile as you will no longer juggle through several remotes and will enjoy the convenience that such a device provides.  Yes, as with most uni-remotes there is the initial chore of setting up the device but Logitech tries to make this process as simple as possible (you will need to connect the device to a PC via USB to download and install specific settings for each of your devices) and for a device that is several years old still receives support as a new model Blu-Ray player I purchased in June was found in their device listings the day I purchased said device.  With the gorgeous backlit keys and color LCD this device still retains a 'wow' factor every time my guests/friends see the remote for the first time.  Here's to another 2 years with my Harmony One!

I like the fact that the controls are also on the speaker:  so when the volume is too loud from song to song, I don't have to rush to the device, I just turn it down on the speaker.  The play/pause button is also nice since that allows me to take calls etc.All in all, very happy with this little guy and I may just go for a second one to experience the full on stereo they talk about.

The keyboard worked fine, the mouse worked, but turned off or went into some kind of sleep mode after about 3 to 5 seconds. The mouse didn't stop working, it just went into a sleep type mode and you would have to scroll the wheel or click a button to get the mouse to move on screen. This was not just a operating system problem as I tested it in a protected mode program and it happened inside that program as well. This kept happening after a reboot, though no reboot was needed. Checked online for software for it as none came with it, nothing found. Checked manufacturers website, no drivers needed or supplied through support page.The keyboard and mouse worked, just not like any other wireless mouse I have owned. I personally would never buy this product again. If your current wireless mouse performs this way, it might be just what you're looking for, as the keyboard and mouse look and feel great.

$REVIEW.: I have Garmin 660 and 765T GPS devices.  I had purchased a genuine Garmin case for the Nuvi 660 unit, but the Nuvi 765T was always just tossed in the center console compartment in my car when not in use.  Wanting something to protect the 765T, I decided to give the AmazonBasics Portable GPS carrying case a try.  It arrived in Amazon's famous "Frustration Free Packaging," which provided proper protection for shipping yet was extremely easy to open.  The Amazon case is soft and flexible, with durable elastic on each side, allowing the case to expand for different GPS models.  My Garmin Nuvi 765T slid into the case with little effort, although pulling the device back out took a little more work.  The fit was snug at first, but after using the case for a couple of weeks the case loosened its grip just enough to allow easy retrieval of the GPS unit.  But it is still plenty snug enough to prevent the GPS from falling out of the case accidentally.The inside of the case has a soft padding, which prevents scratching of the LCD display screen and also offers a decent amount of protection against bumps and short drops.  Because my Nuvi 765T GPS device has a slider type on/off switch on the top of the device, I find it necessary to slide the switch in the lock position before inserting into the case.  This isn't a problem with the case, but rather an unavoidable issue with the design of the GPS as well.  I have the same problem with the Garmin case, if I slide my 765T in it.  My Nuvi 660 has a push button type on/off switch, which isn't affected by sliding the unit in and out of the case.I am extremely pleased with this AmazonBasics GPS carrying case.  It is soft, well padded, looks stylish, and provides the right amount of protection for my GPS investment.  While it's not genuine leather, it looks like it is, and it is soft and supple enough that I am sure it will stand up to many years of use and abuse.  I definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a protective case for their GPS.  Please remember, this case has exterior dimensions of 4.92 x 3.07 x 0.78 inches, and was designed specifically for Garmin Nuvi series GPS devices, although I'm sure a few other manufacturer's GPS devices could fit in this case as well.  The case is inexpensive but is made of quality materials.  It is definitely a great, cheaper alternative to buying a Garmin branded case.  I actually find the Amazon case to be better than the Garmin case, but that is just my opinion.

Also, according to the DirectX diagnostic program, their drivers are not signed. No wonder they're messing with everything else on the sound card.If you want to use this device strictly to listen to music through your digital entertainment center's speakers using the optical digital connection, you will be quite pleased. However, don't expect Dolby 5.1. This device does not provide Dolby technology.If, however, you want to listen through the earphone output on the device, you will hear all sorts of pops and cracks.Also if you want to use the device to record music on your computer hard drive and need to listen to the monitor, the monitor switch is hidden in the device volume panel (it is a recent software upgrade), in the Mixer function window. There is a small box to the right of the field that says Mic-in/Line-in. Click that box. However, you will notice a horrible delay between what you say and what you hear back through the monitor. This is an absolutely unacceptable engineering flaw.I've communicated with Creative about the problem, and their attitude is "so sad, too bad, get a refund."To summarize, this is great for simply listening to music through your stereo. It is horrible for listening through headphones or when using the microphone/line-in monitor.

If it's the former, you can return them for a replacement (30-day warranty through eForce). If it's the latter than you're out of luck. Fortunately, these are super cheap so no big loss. I got this kit and it worked pretty well for six months. Now both batteries don't hold a charge at all. I also purchased a couple of the Maximal semi-name brand versions over a year ago and for not much more and those still work.

I get quite a few channels, but I'm not completely sure how far away my furthest channel is, so reception appears to be good but I can't be sure.  My one and only complaint with this antenna is that after a tumble off of a table where I had set it while getting everything together to mount it, the support arm holding the housing to the mounting plate broke inside the antenna housing, and now the housing is just sitting on the support arm.  Because of this, it sways with the breeze and sits lop-sided on the support.  This would be worse if the antenna was bigger, or more obvious where it is mounted, but its still annoying since with how short of a tumble the antenna took to a relatively soft floor (not carpet, but not hardwood either), added to that the light weight of the antenna, I am sure that a strong enough gust would have caused this to happen anyway!  It was just a matter of time.  Definitely disappointed that this happened, but more disappointed that it took the mildest of tumbles to cause it.

$REVIEW.: Nice unit with well designed controls. My issue is having to use the provided ear buds, as they serve as an FM antenna. Not a fan of ear buds. When I use my lightweight headset instead, the reception is poor. I use them on the treadmill at Golds Gym. The audio for the various TV sets is supplied via FM. For my needs, the Coby unit for $11 works fine. Reception is better [with my headset] and it also has station presets, so I can change audio from TV to TV easily.
$SUMMARY.: Must use the provided ear buds.

$REVIEW.: There is a CMOS sensor in the LX7, and it is a nice sensor. ISO800 is useful rather than ISO400 on my LX5. RAW is clean, even at very high ISO (1600). In the presence of noise, the RAW clarity remains. More importantly, the CMOS sensor eliminates the vertical purple lines that appear around bright lights in the LX5 videos.IMO, the biggest feature of the LX7 is the addition of FullHD Video. But Panasonic has crippled the LX7 so it can film a maximum clip length of 30 minutes. No weddings, no lectures. The LX5 films AVCHD until the battery runs out (about 2hrs 16mins) but the improved FullHD video on the LX7 stops at the 30 minute mark. And at the 30min/4 mark if you shoot at the high speed mode 120fps (x4 framerate)(it only gives you 7 minutes). So forget any idea of leaving your camera focused on a tree, hoping to catch that magical bird takeoff. If the birds haven't flown in 7 minutes, your LX7 has stopped filming.Additionally, when I try to use Shutter-Preferred Creative-Video mode to get smooth motion-blur, I find that I am not allowed to use the bokeh from the new lens. When I engage the new internal ND filter in Shutter-Preferred mode, in order to maximize bokeh, I find the lens is restricted to f4. I cannot use the f1.4 - f3.5 stops. So I cannot get decent bokeh from the new lens unless I jump through hoops and use an external screw-on ND filter (there is an adapter to buy, too).I understand that Panasonic are terrified that these new cameras will hurt sales of their camcorder range, but there is no excuse for crippling the LX7 in this way. Panasonic are making you carry both a camcorder and the LX7 in your pocket when you travel. IMO If Panasonic want to sell these LX7 they had better put their thinking caps on, and issue a firmware upgrade ASAP... The RX100 has changed the game...
$SUMMARY.: Video mode of LX7 has been crippled

$review_text.: I'm not going to claim I'm a technological genius, but neither am I a technological noob. I've had universal remote controls before, so I know how to program them. At the very least, I know how to follow instructions. So, I was very surprised when I followed the instructions to the letter with both of the remotes in this pack, and neither worked. I tried at least half a dozen times to program either to work with my Visio TV, my Dish Network and my Zenith DVD player. Nothing. Finally, when I did the opposite of what the instructions said, i.e., I started with my TV OFF instead of ON, at least one of the remotes...the six device remote...finally worked. However, I never could program it to work with my Dish device, nor did it work with my Zenith DVD player. Although, when I was trying to get it to work with my Zenith DVD player (and yes, I had the device on, had pushed the DVD button, and had entered in the correct code), it started turning on and off my Vizio TV. Go figure. The three device remote never did work with any of my equipment.Now, to be fair, I do have a 2 TV Dish DVR. So, the one DVR works two separate TVs. This could have been the problem as to why the device would not work with my Dish. However, having said that, my setup is one that is very common, and when the manual for the remotes says it works with Dish Network, I'm just going to assume they've thought about this situation, and made their devices to work with this setup. Clearly, they did not. Or if they did, it isn't as "Simple" as they would like me to believe. If these aren't compatible with 2 TV Dish DVR devices, I would have really liked to have known that. It should be very clearly stated in the manual, and I didn't see that anywhere. So, I'm just going to assume it's an oversight. Though....it's a pretty big oversight, IMHO.I would have loved to have these work, and if I ever get them to work, I will amend my review, but for now, it's one star.

very crisp with vivd colors and a fabulous viewing angle

Great smart features and nice speakers


The brightness could be an issue for some people


I personnaly find it overly brite but with blacks that are so deep that it seems to burry some details in some instances witch has been a minor issue for me as well
Very thin depth and shockingly narrow bezel
Great tv over all but with one major issue if you are a gamer


Like i said, i've had plasmas for many years so know about burn-in, and this tv most certanly has burn in, the wrost I've ever had to deal with, in fact

All of my other plasmas have never had issue with burn in and I have left my screen paused for long periods of time with no burn in


this tv , however has major issues with burn in., I have an xbox one and the xbox symbol in the top right corner has been burned into my screen in less than two months


I still love the tv because of the absolutly butiful picture but the burn in is quite possible.

$REVIEW.: The Viral Arrow case for Ipod Touch 4G is a very tight fit on the ipod.  This interferes with the functioning of the magnets in the cover, they cannot overcome the tendancy of the tight fit of the case to pop the lid open.  This problem is gradually improving as the leather stretches.  I have a splash case for another ipod4G that fits much better but was also more expensive.  You get what you pay for, I.e. flimsy construction and a poor fit.  Caveat Emptor.

This lens is amazing! Only drawback is that you have to set the f-stop manually on the lens itself (your camera won't even recognize that there's a lens on the camera, so no autofocus and no f-stop adjustments on the camera)

But that really makes no difference to me since I use it only for video anyways
Seriously, for the price you can't beat the wow-factor this lens packs with it

$review_text.: So I bought this cooling pad hoping to solve my laptop overheating issue. I can safely say that it does cool down your laptop very well. Being a techy computer person I did install a CPU temp monitoring program on my computer and I saw that this pad consistently lowered the temperature of my computer by a significant amount (>7 degrees). The fact that it tilts is also nice as it lowers the stress on your hands while typing.That being said... I am only giving this 3 out of 5 stars because the product is cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. One piece broke on Fan 1 on the first day and about 20 days later the second fan went off its ball bearings. The reason I am not giving it a lower review is because a quick 5 minute phone call to the company that makes this product (Cooler Master) allowed me to fill out an online form for new fans - no questions asked. So their support is great and they guarantee their product. I am lowering it to 3 instead of 5 stars due to the problem of having to do this part request. A product should be good right when you buy it and not require new, yet free, parts.All in all, assuming nothing breaks, you will be happy you bought this. It does what you expect it to do - cool your computer. And if something does break support is a quick call away.

$review_text.: There's absolutely no way this clamp will ever let go of the mic stand if you set it properly. The downside is the ball-joint design for positioning the tablet is really poorly designed. It doesn't feel very strong and you really have to bare down on it to make it feel like it won't lose grip and rotate your tablet out of position.
$SUMMARY.: Very solid clamp, poorly designed ball-joint

$REVIEW.: Ordered for Roku player because adapter that came with Roku quit working and Roku was out of stock for the replacement.  It has a blue LED that indicates that it is on.  The adapter does get warm, like the original Roku adapter, even when the Roku is inactive, so I typically unplug it when not in use. The adopter for the new Roku I owned failed, but the adopter for the first Roku, the original version with all video outputs plus a Ethernet input, still works.

$REVIEW.: I've always had good luck with G-Technology. This little G-Drive Mini has given me solid performance in Final Cut and After Effects over Firewire 800. Lightroom performance with RAW files has been satisfying. The performance overall is great for a bus powered drive.Physically I like this drive a lot. The styling is great with G-RAIDs and G-Drives, which is a compliment. It doesn't match G-Speeds too well. Petty thing to complain about, the price difference between this is a factor of ten. The included case is great, just loop a cable and velcro it down around the top so it stays with the drive. It has what I assume to be an elastic belt loop on it. I suppose this is intended to go on the strap of a gear bag? I have no idea who would attach a hard drive to their belt or have their hard drive dangling for life on the exterior of a bag, but it's there if you find a use for it. The fact that a case is bundled is great. More external drives should include cases.One gripe I have is that my laptop (a Toshiba) won't power it over the bus using a single USB cable. If I use a USB cable with two USB ends (one for data one for power) it works fine. Unfortunately G-Tech didn't bundle such a cable with the drive, instead wanting you to invest in an AC power adapter. The lack of need for such an adapter is the reason to get a mini. This is the reason I rated it four stars instead of five.Overall it's a solid little drive. If you need a portable for multimedia get it now. If you want something that matches Apple's aesthetics go for it. If you just need some portable storage you can probably find a more affordable option.

$review_text.: My Klipsch ProMedia surround sound speakers died on me after about 8 years of use and I needed to replace them. I was considering buying another set, but decided to shop around a bit first. After reading the reviews on these speakers, and considering the price, I decided to give them a shot. I'm glad I did. Quite simply put, they sound great. The two speakers pump out a big sound that is rich and smooth. In my opinion, they sound almost as good as the Klipsch speakers. The bass isn't the greatest I've heard, but definitely not lacking. Overall, these Cyber Acoustics speakers deliver high end sound at a fraction of the price.In terms of design, the speakers are not very large and do not take up much space on the desk, which is nice. However, the cord that connects the two speakers could definitely be longer. It's barely long enough to fit both speakers between my dual monitor set-up. The volume control wheel is awesome, and is very convenient for adjusting sound levels on the fly.Bottom Line: These are solid desktop speakers that will leave you with money to spare.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the battery and it arrived shortly after the order was placed. By all appearances the battery worked fine. But, after approx 5 months of use the battery life shortened to between 45 minutes and 1 hr. I contacted the company, they confirmed it was still under warranty and asked I perform a series of tests to insure the battery was failing.I performed the tests and the company acknowledged the battery was failing. However, they informed me the battery was out of stock and I should contact amazon for a refund. I could not get a refund from amazon because it was beyond the normal 30 days refund policy.Out of desperation, I contacted amazon and after being passed to a number of representatives, I was granted an exception to return the battery for a refund through amazon. I was really pleased amazon helped solve the problem.I am not happy with the battery company. I will not buy form them again.

$review_text.: The photo is all wrong...the secret to using these is to apply the center-of-gravity rule.The grip head is very cheap and only has a simple rubber ring to apply friction with. It adapts a simple plastic baby pin mount. It does not follow the "right hand rule" of grip heads, rather I found it does the opposite: the grip head should be on the left to tighten with downward pressure. However, really it isn't strong enough to manage downward pressure regardless (a 40x60" 5-in-1 diffuser will fit on this mount but it can't lift it from one end).So, the trick is, pop open the grip head and mount it to the center rod of the telescope. Mount it to the exact center of gravity with the reflector on, and then you won't have any sideways force applied. It can easily manage the 40x60 5-in-1's when using the center of gravity.That is also true of the clamps: they go on diametric opposite points on the reflector, meaning the telescoping rod is bisecting the reflector. This isn't a problem of course if it is behind the reflector, but when you are using the silk diffuser, you will have the bar and grip head smack in the middle of your silk. One hopes the diffusion is enough to mitigate any shadows that would cast.The 40x60"s have a pretty wide frame that's hard to get into these cheap plastic clips. The secret to that is, bend the reflector to snap it in at an angle. That requires quite a bit of dexterity, and I wouldn't attempt it if I had a heart condition, as it is under pressure. You will want setwear gloves to handle the ungainly little clips.Hey, it's cheap!

It is frustrating to take only 4 or 5 pictures and have the batteries have low or not enough charge to continue.  Not sure if it is the camera, the battery or operator error.  I have read and re-read manual and tried various changes but still have the loss of battery charge.

$review_text.: The ex bogen now manfroto line of tripods feature in the 501 and 503 HDV class fluid video heads, a removable plate that is intended to stay on your camera.The plate has 3 attachment and allignment methods#1 - a spring loaded pin ensures the lens is pointed down the tripod the proper way#2 - a normal 10/24 tripod screw (removable and re-installable)#3 - a 3/8" standard used on audio and heavy video equipment screw, again removable and storable.The system is designed to allow you to use your one fluid head and one tripod with multiple cameras without undoing screws - it's a 2 step processstep 1 - rotate the big lock lever on the tripod head 180 degrees to unlock the camera.  It will now slide, but won't come out.step 2 - press the red button - its red to warn you after this the camera is comming out so be prepared to catch it.You can put a second slide on another camera (ex: still and video).  When you slide it in, it will click once it gets past the red button part, but stillslide so you can adjust the blance on the fluid head.  When you have the camera where you want it, rotate that lock lever back into the lock position and the camera wont move.This allows you to use your 501 and 503 heads to hold:video (most likely)heavy still cameras (pro slr)audio equipment (uses the 3/8" screw)misc other items (even the marantz 661pmdMarantz PMD661 Portable SD Recorder) has a tripod stud receptical and can attach a plate.what I like about this system the most is that if you don't have a screwdriver to properly set up the plate, you can break off the tab from a soda can and use it to tighten down the desired screw.  A rubber plug allows you to remove the unused screw, and there is storage for it on the side of the 503 head so you don't loose it.These plates make a great head even more flexible by allowing you to shoot some high definition (4096 pixel+) stills after shooting HD Video.  The ability to slide the camera front to back to balance it without fear of it falling once you hear the red button click is nice too - it temporarily keeps your camera in the head until you achieve balance.  BTW - most camera or slr mfgrs put the tripod mount near the center of gravity to assist you here.  If using a long telephoto lensOpteka 500mm f/8 Telephoto Mirror Lens for Olympus EVOLT E-520, E-510, E-500, E-420, E-410, E-330, E-300, E-3 & E-1 Digital SLR Camerathey will often have their own tripod point since they are heavy enough to move the CG forward of the camera body.If you do video, still, and audio, order 2 of these slides (1 comes with the head) and your favorite attachment will be "hooked up" in seconds.  Otherwise 1 is enough.

$review_text.: There are some good reviews here, but i wanted to respond to the few negative reviews.  First, there may be some people who don't know how to set up a bluetooth connection properly, and they need to get some help, because this is a great little keyboard and case. If you still have troubles, once it is set up correctly, then you likely have a bad unit and should return it for a good one. This types and protects wonderfully.Next, do NOT expect this (plus the iPad2) to be a laptop.  Some reviewers seem to think that all they need to have a good laptop is to get a keyboard.  No, not even close. Most tablets are designed to be, well, tablets.  Extra light and small Mobile computing platforms for doing light computing tasks, especially for times that a full computer (laptop, whether Mac or PC) is not needed. By definition, it is not going to work or act like a full laptop... in other words, I don't run Final Cut Pro on the iPad, nor do I want to. This product WILL allow you to type up emails and word processing documents (if you have the apps, obviously) like a dream.  I rarely get a letter that doesn't "connect" right while typing. But, no, this is NOT the same as having a laptop... it is better in some ways and it is worse in some ways. I use a notebook computer and an iPad and I bring along the one that makes the most sense for what I will be doing (software wise). I am shocked how often it is the iPad2.In addition, make sure you are ordering the newer product if you have the iPad2 (its worth the extra 6 bucks)as the fit will not be good with the iPad2 if you buy Kennsington's iPad1 case... it won't be snug.  Personally, I don't mind taking the iPad2 out of the case for pictures or video, but (of course) with the correct case you won't need to do so.Lastly, ask yourself if you really NEED a bluetooth keyboard for your iPad?  If you type a lot, you are going to love it. But if you only type on a rare occasion, you will find a thinner case and the virtual iPad keyboard will be more fitting for you.  I really like this case, obviously, but it is the right thing for me. If you understand that this product will not give you a full PC or MacBook Pro notebook, then you too will love this nice little devise and case.
$SUMMARY.: Great case and keyboard combo, but...

$review_text.: As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these "pocket cameras" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE:SD1100 ISAn update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE:SD870 IS(The camera on this page)The ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide "The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World."3RD PLACE:SD770 ISJust released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE:SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE:SD890 ISWant a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE:SD790 ISWith the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE:SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.8TH PLACE:SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE:SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless it's priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.10TH PLACE:SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder. Choose a 2008 model instead.

The open door doesn't affect playing or charging; just irritating and doesn't look nearly as nice when using it for a dinner party.I'll check the warranty, but I think it's past.

$REVIEW.: Only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is how hard it is to push the relay into the socket, I realize you don't want it too loose so things fall out or don't have a firm connection, just felt it didn't have to be so hard to push a relay in this.

$review_text.: I've been a Windows user my whole life and decided that I would take the plunge and go with Mac for college. I had played around with OSX on a friend's laptop and it was love at first sight. The Macbook is sleek, compact, and fast.The wireless connection (Airport) is fully compatible with a, b, and g networks. It works with no problems at home and school.The Mac looks and works great. Overheating is a problem because it gets too hot to keep on your lap and the fans turn on at full blast.If you're thinking of buying a Mac, buy it for the OS. It's intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to use. Personally, I feel the black Macbook is worth the extra $200 since it won't get dirty and need it's front panels (where you rest your wrists) replaced and for the larger hard drive (80GB instead of 60).
$review_summary.: One of my best purchases ever

I hooked up the firewire cable to the mac pro attached the adapter and plugged it into the drobo using the thunderbolt. It won't mount. Did some research in forums and apparently this is the case it will not work with the Drobo. Just an FYI for anybody like me who could have used this info. Im sure its great for other uses this one not so much.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this filter as part of a patchwork of adapters to take shots of the May Solar Eclipse. It's not dark enough to risk solar damage to the shoot solar eclipses.  The description categorizes the filter for solar events, but I wouldn't suggest you do that.I had GREAT success with a Kenko Solar Filter. These are pricey, so don't get one unless you plan to use it for direct solar shots such as the recent May 20th Solar Eclipse or Transit of Venus. This lens is Welder's Goggles dark.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGQ088/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00What I will say, is this filter is good if you're just a regular photo folk where you want shots of a sunrise or sunset where your shot will have the sun in the shot, but likely, you'll have other things in the field of view such as friend/family/landscape. It's a good filter to have in your arsenal of filters.Even if you don't consider yourself a photo buff, but you have an SLR or DSLR camera, filters are important. My #1 filter choice, a must! is a Polarized Filter. You can make the blandest of shots jump out. If you've ever wondered how photographers get the rocks under water, they use a polarized filter. Hoya, Tiffan & others all make good ones. Don't rack your brain to find the ideal one. These filters act just like polarized sun glasses, removing glass from the shot and bringing items hidden in shadows to life.  Other filters, to consider: red, yellow, green & blue. That's all you need and they are better than attempting to use the filter features in many new digital SLRs
$SUMMARY.: Not ideal for direct Sun/Solar Shots.

$REVIEW.: I believe this set up would work fine for a system that does not stay on 24 hrs a day OC'd.  I run 2 radiators with fluid going through CPU than 2X 7950 GPU.  The heat build up after 24hours caused the plastic plug used to put the LED light in to crack, thus I have a leak.  I am highly suspecting that it was a combined build up of heat from the LED light and the system fluid.  I ran this same SETUP and temps through a thermosys bigwater set up for about a year, when that system finally cracked at the fill port.Since I am overseas, I opted to put thereafter of the plastic plug in the hole and seal it with epoxy...works fine atm.Thus, if you want this setup for a low noise, lightly used system, it may work..I would be cautious of using the LED light in the cheap plastic plug.UPDATE/EDIT- I put down from a 2 star to a 1 star-  This thing started leaking on me between the seams of the front faceplate around 30 hours after above fix---I would not recommend this to anyone!

$REVIEW.: I bought this one because of its price and reviews, I said if it is a heating problem, I can manage that. I found that it is totally defective and caused my laptop to go crazy! it is recharging for a second then disconnect for another second then recharge again for a second and so on! goes from recharging to disconnecting in less than 3 seconds and in a non stopping way. I hope it didnt damage my battery.I got another one from a store and it works fine, so it is not my laptop that has the problem.Forget to say that while disconnecting a weird whistle sound was coming out from the laptop!!!! its behavior is really crazy..I am trying to return it now to supplier, without having to pay the shipping since it is not my fault, hope they dont give me hard times accepting that.

$REVIEW.: Very simple to use, works with my D7000 with no problems.  Only thing I don't like is that you have to be directly in front of the camera to make it work.  This, however, is not the remote's fault!  I recommend also buying one that has a wire also for from behind or to the side shots if you are trying to get something such as an animal or insect from farther away.

$review_text.: I'm using the Etekcity wireless controlled switch socket in my woodworking shop control my shop vac


 When I'm using the various tools, I always attach a vacuum hose to control the dust and shavings, if the tool is set up for it
 The problem is that the shop vac and the tools are often some distance apart and it's tempting not to bother with the vac if I'm only making a few cuts or sanding a small area
 There are devices such as theiVac Automated Vacuum Switchthat will control a shop vac automatically when a tool is activated

 The downside of this solution is that it's expensive and only works for 110v tools


 I have a mix of 110v and 220v machinery, so this won't work for me.So far the Etekcity is working just as I expected


 Either of the 2 remotes will reliably start and stop the shop vac from anywhere in the shop


 I'm happy that 2 remotes come with this because I can leave one at each end of the shop and I'm never far from one.This thing is big

 I have it plugged into aTripp Lite PS2408 Power Strip 120V 5-15R 8 Outlet 15ft Cord Vertical Metal, and unfortunately there is no way to avoid having it cover 2 of the outlets

 Fortunately, that still leaves me 6 more, which is enough


 I dinged it one star due to the size.


$review_summary.: Works well for remote operation of a shop vac dust collector, but it's pretty big.

$review_text.: There is a lot to learn if this is your first Android device. This is my second Nexus 7. The good news is that the Nexus 7 can be configured to:- replace your ebook reader. I love the Kindle app for it. As it comes, the Nexus 7 is a bit too bright for reading at night but there is an app to custom dim the screen further to make it just right for your eyes.- replace a laptop computer. With a touch-screen, such simple matters as selecting text to cut copy or paste can be &lt;&lt;&lt; utterly maddening.>>> However, these routine tasks become easy, even quite pleasant, with a decent external mouse and good external keyboard. Good peripherals take up very little briefcase space and really make the Nexus 7 an excellent road-warrior. An OTG cable and app change the charging micro-USB port into an external access port for reading and writing memory sticks and even powered hard disk drives. 16GB is plenty with such external storage. When not working, the Nexus 7 tablet is such a handy package you are most likely to have it, well, right at hand.- The screen is remarkable for watching movies and is very nice for video calls (Skype, Tango, etc.) I am pleased the screen is also very readable for texts, emails and browsing the Internet. (My eyes really are those of a senior although my younger-than-my-age brain is shocked to see how old I am in the mirror... :)All of this for about $50 more than only an e-reader! Do look up the LONG Nexus 7 review here on Amazon which has a Very Large Number of comments -- because that author gives superb technical advice.As a Windows computer guru and Mac aficionado, I did not expect to be so impressed with the Nexus 7, but I am. When I ordered this Nexus 7 I was already aware that an improved version would be coming soon. I bought this one anyway because the value-to-price ratio is so positive. I came to depend on my first Nexus 7 so much, that for the price I wanted a spare machine I could configure identically. (Two Nexus 7 cost me less than a laptop. Spend $200 for a spare tire, professionally speaking? Sure.) This time I sprang for the 32 GB model (my other Nexus 7 is fine with 16GB) because when travelling I can sometimes be uncluttered of peripherals to use the additional storage for movies, downloaded programs and music.Do get a good case for it. (The Nexus 7's lovely screen is not the latest Gorilla glass.) For its fine protection and versatility, I very much like the Moko Slim Fit case which I've reviewed for the Nexus 7.Android is something else but definitely worth learning to use, so be patient getting through the learning curve.The Nexus 7 is most highly recommended.
$SUMMARY.: Replaces broken e-book reader. For very little more this gives you an excellent reader, whole computer & amazing movie screen!

$review_text.: I had installed a Zalman 9700 "Ferris wheel" CPU cooler
I ended up replacing the Mobo since I had compatibility issues in the exchange
Bought new Mobo and had plenty left to re-install, and then enough to re-install the old CPU and cooler back on the original Mobo.It appears this new synthetic compound does not harden and become crusty at least in in the first 2 weeks.With that huge Zalman cooler, I bumped it while running wires in the new case


The cooler did a right oblique and I was able to straighten it back up with no problem.

$review_text.: I had read all the reviews before buying the product and they were largely favorable
 I can certainly add my voice to that group
 The Xacti comes out of the box and into service right after charging the battery


 It was easy to use and takes outstanding still pictures as well as very high quality video


 I have never been a video buff but I felt that I wanted to try to get more into it when considering all of the great tools now available for manipulation of video

 I now find myself remembering to bring the Xacti and having video memories available.I had read some people thinking the battery life could be a problem
 I have not experienced that and I wonder whether the concerns might not stem from the difference between the sleep setting and the off setting
 The Xacti can be be turned off with a long push of the on/off button but it can also be suspended with a short duration push of the on/off button

 It seems at least plausible that some people think it is off when it is not actually


 Certainly just a theory.

$REVIEW.: Purchased last December to upgrade the Canon 17-85mm IS "kit lens" that came with my 20D.  Careful testing showed this new lens to be about "one-stop sharper" over the 17-35mm range than the kit lens.  What I mean by this is that the 17-55 matched the 17-85 sharpness with one stop faster aperture: same sharpness at f2.8 for 17mm as the 17-85 at f4.0.  Beyond 35mm the sharpness of the 17-55 faded until both lenses were essentially equal in sharpness at 55mm.  The 17-55 was noticibly softer at 55mm than at 17mm while the 17-85 was  sharper at 55mm than at 17mm.  So, the advantage of f2.8 and better sharpness at the wide end for the 17-55 is at least partially negated by diminished sharpness at the meager 55mm long end.  The 17-85 has about the same build quality but is smaller, lighter, covers a longer focal length range and for me is a better deal at about half the price.
