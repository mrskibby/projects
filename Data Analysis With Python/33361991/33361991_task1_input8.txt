$review_text.: I like this radio for listening to radio or CD, and use it with my iPod as long as I choose a playlist and let it play.PROS:It was delivered on time.Great sound.I used my iPod touch and navigation on the radio is great. You can choose songs by artist, gender or playlists exactly like an iPod classic.USB charges your iPod so you don't need to worry for battery problems anymore.Song title and artist are displayed on the menu.You can choose from lots of colors.CD and radio are fine.It has Pandora (I have not used it).I could even plug my iPad and works great.CONS:The up and down buttons on the faceplate respond very slow. When I want to change a song on my iPod I have to use the navigation menu because up and down takes forever to work. When you connect your iPod you can't change songs on it, you have to use the radio's menu, and since up and down buttons are worthless, so is the remote. I don't think it is a defective unit because they work just fine with radio and CD. I will read the manual to see if I am doing something wrong.Menu is not user friendly. It is not hard, but the search button that is used for navigation on the iPod is very small and there is no pause or mute button on the faceplate, so you have to turn it off or lower volume to answer your cell phone.Information is displayed in small letters with a distracting background. (You can change background but have not done it yet, maybe there are better ones).

$review_text.: Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/BThe Apple Wireless Keyboard works perfectly with my IPad Air and Macbook Pro and fits nicely anywhere I place it. The convenience of Apples wireless Keyboard is a luxury addition to my Apple devices. I could have just use the built in keyboard on my IPad Air and laptop, but I like the idea of using this  wireless keyboard with my Apple devices anywhere in my home.Also, this wireless keyboard allows me the convenience of a physical keyboard typing rather than relying on the IPads Air built-in touch screen keyboard. Yes, I could have bought a keyboard case for the IPad (which I did for portability reasons); but I wanted this wireless keyboard for its easy use at home.In conclusion I bought this wireless keyboard for the convenience of portable placement where I want it at home; I use this wireless keyboard in conduction with my Apple wireless trackpad. Using both wireless devices allows me to type with one hand while the other hand switches from typing to using the pad without having to look down at the keyboard. These are my personal justification to purchase this luxury.  Because it is a well made Apple product and because it syncs easily with my Apple devices, I give this wireless keyboard a five star for its practical application.

$review_text.: When I bought this remote, I had not anticipated buying the 7D. Happily, I can use this remote on both cameras with no problem. A fellow hobbyist showed me her remote, a non-Canon brand for which she paid slightly less than half. Same functionality, same reliability.For the small percentage of time I do use this, I have now come to realize that it might have been more practical to look at offbrands. I haven't experienced anything negative with this remote, so overall, it works the way it's been advertised.

$REVIEW.: I bought this keyboard, because I needed a wired, back-lit keyboard and this was one of the least expensive with a number of favorable reviews.First, yes I am very happy with this keyboard.  I tend to use a desk lamp, rather than the overhead light and the pullout keyboard rest is too low for the light to reach at night. All of the keyboard's keys are well and evenly lit.My only complaint, and one I read about before buying, is that the "Enter" key is small (about half the size of the same key on a full-size keyboard) and is right next to the "Home" Key. And I mean, right next to it.  There is no extra space between the special keys like there is with full-size keyboards.  It takes some getting use to.  So, the same is true for the "Backspace" and space keys.  However, for the price I am very pleased.  I am adjusting to it.
$review_summary.: Nice compact, wired, back-lit keyboard for the price.

$REVIEW.: Hooked up my cable and internet to the splitter, turned on the TV. Both went off, traced it back to the splitter which drastically degraded the signal to the point of both not being able to operate. The degradation was apparent on the cable TV without the internet plugged in. I realized maybe I went too cheap with this splitter, seems to be held together by glue in the back, most splitters also have the degradation numbers on the back but this has no markings but RCA on the front.

$REVIEW.: Purchased back in mid September 2011, not from Amazon, but from Costco.First one was dead-on-arrival.  I returned it (same day) and since I believe in second chances, I swapped it for a replacement.  I was using it primarily as a storage drive for surveillance video, and so I never benchmarked file transfer speeds, etc, etc.  Also, I had backed up some files, but nothing major and luckily I had double backed up the most important files on a Buffalo Linkstation Mini.All was fine up until about 3 days ago (Feb 25), when my surveillance system software started locking up on me... troubleshot to this faulty drive.  Tried rebooting, resetting, etc, etc, and all it does is faint beeping noise.  Drive shows up as empty now and capacity of 0 (ZERO).  Initiated process of RMA with Seagate.  Disappointed in quality and I will not be purchasing a Seagate network/desktop drive for a long, long time.I've had good luck so far with a pair of Seagate USB portable drives (500 GB/1 TB), but they're not connected 24/7; so knock wood.  They do have data on them that I do NOT want to lose... I have them backed up on my desktop PC atm, so once I get a new NAS, they'll be backed up on it.  Next NAS will be something that has raid capability and multiple drives, and capability to rebuild a failed drive.  Words of advice:  if you need a reliable drive to back up important files, save your money and apply it towards a true NAS.Not sure yet what I'll do with this drive after it's repaired, will address that when the time comes.

$REVIEW.: I have had two projection DLP systems need a new bulb.  I guess I should have just bought a bulb as in the end, that is all I used from this subassembly (or the other).  Fortunately, this is not a stretch task for anyone handy enough with the right set of small screw drivers and some neoprene gloves (better than latex for blocking sodium from sweaty palms, though you should only handle any similar bulb by the heavy glass edges or connectors).  I just hate having to play the guessing game on just how &#34;original&#34; or &#34;compatible&#34; the various choices are--or pay the exorbitant prices of the original projector manufacturer to resell a bulb wrapped in the &#34;right&#34; piece of plastic.  Next time, I am just going to open up the set and only buy exactly the identical original bulb--to get the best of both cost and function.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these looking for a charger to take with me to Spain. While I will have a regular camera I also wanted to keep a time lapsed camera going to. But my experience with my GoPro is that its battery will flat-line after a few hours. This was quite a deal coming with two batteries. It was also rather convenient that it works with European power sources using the passive adapter that comes with it (it's a loose fit but it works).I don't want to have to keep changing the battery , so to help out I also ordered aGoPro Camera ABPAK-301 Battary BacPac (Black)so that I can have both the regular sized battery and the BacPac on it at the same time. There's a slight difference in the capacity of the batteries with the Wasabi batteries being rated as storing more energy (1200mAh). So I should be able to get slightly more out of my camera when I have both of the Wasabi batteries mounted.

I returned it because it was a screen protector, nothing to help the glare. I didn't get a refund but it was my ordering error so that's okay.&#62; the amFilm by TechMatte ($7.95) x (2) because I ordered it twice. The second one I didn't even bother to open or try to use because the first set was screen bubbly. In fact, a whole corner was non-sticking... (see my other review.)The BoxWave was inexpensive, easy to put on, and solved my screen glare without adding bubbles anywhere. It solved my reflection/glare problem instantly and there is no problem with screen (non)sensitivity. I wish I ordered this in the beginning and I would have saved $$$ without adding frustration and bubbles! Now hope I can take my Kindle on public transportation and read without all the reflections.

The 360 degree motion for camera turning is always a good option as well. It's nice so you don't have to pick up your tripod and move it all around all the time!

$review_text.: I am relatively new to the SLR picture taking world. All along i have been using point and shoot and was never much into photography until i bought my first Canon rebel XS. The canon came with a 18-55mm standard lens. The canon lens was alright with not much WOW factor to it. I bought the tamron lens so that i could have a better range on my pictures and i was happily surprised by the picture quality. The Tamron lens took sharper and more realistic pictures as compared to the 18-55mm canon lens. I have not used any other brands so to me the Tamron lens is very well made and well worth the money i paid for it (Amazon - $164) Overall it was a very good buy and with the 6 years warranty, this deal beats all. I will definitely look into getting another Tamron for my next lens.

$REVIEW.: ProsIt boosts to 1110 out of the box with no intervention from me. With tweaking I'm sure I could get it higher, if I needed to.BF4 on Ultra with MSAA on 4x stays above 100fps.Cons:It wasn't free.....Runs warmer than my 7950Drivers constantly(every 2-5mins) crashing/recovering in Modern Warfare 2 (never an issue with the 7950 at same settings) 1 positive is that while it does crash, the game keeps running and even though I'm usually dead when it recovers I can continue playing until the next time.Overall I'm pleased, it performs great, and even though it's probably overkill for 1080 gaming, I'd rather it be overkill then not much of an upgrade.

$REVIEW.: Smaller even than I expected, quiet, and fast
Just backed up the entire contents of two computers, barely making a dent in the 500 gb drive


I am also planning to use it as direct storage for large camera RAW files

Comes with a very simple to use backup/restore manager, that you can set up for automatic or manual backups and file syncing between computers


A perfect size to slip into a purse or even a pocket

Solidly made, with a rubber backing on the bottom; comes with a blessedly short USB cord.The one comment I have for makers of portable drives is that it would be a nice amenity if these came with a light case (such as a microfiber sleeve).

$REVIEW.: I bought this cheap sleeving in kit in the hopes of individually sleeving my PSU cables for my latest build (MDPC-X style - google it). I am trying to be really fair in this review so please keep in mind that I bought this kit for a specific purpose.The Good:Cost effective. There is a decent amount of sleeving in this kit, although you will want to purchase several.Heatshrink. The included heathshrink is not bad - about the same quality as the stuff I picked up at Lowes.The Bad:The quality of this sleeving leaves MUCH to be desired. First of all, it isn't round but has been flattened. It kind of straightened out when on the wires, but looks different compared to the premium sleeving I found at a different site. It is also quite flammable - the special torch I was using for the heatshrink kept burning the sleeving, however the premium sleeving I purchased was not hurt in any way.This is also not entirely opaque! Even though I pulled it very tight when putting it on, it still shows some color through it. Not enough for me to remove it all and buy some more expensive stuff, but enough to irritate me.Bottom line: If you are using this for general usage, or you don't care about opacity in your sleeving, go ahead and purchase this kit. If you are specifically going for the sleek all-black look, and quality is important to you, then MOVE ON. Seriously - I didn't listen to reviews of other colors of this brand and I should have...learn from my $10 mistake. I

$REVIEW.: As a graphic designer, I'd been considering this monitor but just couldn't justify the price....but finally broke down and decided to give it a shot. Setup is easy, and I was up and running in no time. I was impressed with the image quality and text sharpness, but as I spent more time with it, I discovered reds were displayed with a magenta cast, and it lacks some very important controls I need for my everyday graphic design work. I lay out several full color magazines, and the on-screen images need to be pretty close to what will be seen in print with regard to brightness, contrast, color, etc. In comparing this monitor's on-screen images with the press-printed magazine pages, no matter what settings I tried, I couldn't get it close. When I got the brightness about where it shoud be (images in magazine print are ususally darker than what you normally see on a monitor screen), contrast was too low and couldn't be adjusted any higher. Images looked muddy as compared to what they should look like. And there's no brightness adjust button to quickly go back and forth between user and programmed settings. I'd have to completely redo the settings each time I go between magazine work and everyday viewing for web, e-mail, basic design, etc. I'd expect more user-specific controls with a monitor of this price.So for my personal use, this monitor is lacking in necessities for the price. Overall, colors are pretty good, and for those who aren't demanding with regard to very precise color reproduction and don't need the ability to control the image brightness with the press of a button, this is a fine monitor. I'm normally too busy for gaming, so it's not a concern to me.Although smaller, I now have a Sony SDM-HS73B, which is sharper, truer color reproduction, and offers 4 brightness settings, which coupled with selected gamma settings, provides me with exactly what I need in a monitor. With the press of a button, I can instantly go from everyday viewing to magazine work. Image quality and color reproduction is superb.The 213T was returned.

$REVIEW.: Coming into a new age of possibilities means that technology changes, and sometimes I find myself outside of that loop. I love painting but have always been an old fashioned painter, but now more people are looking into graphic designs and creating art that is 100% on computer and not done in your front yard. Corel Painter 12 has so many possibilities for someone who is so new to this type of art, and as a beginner I can honestly say that I was impressed by how easy everything was to get started. Software was easy to install and even though it will take me awhile to get use to mouse strokes instead of paint I can already see this program far beyond what I was hoping for. With so much to learn and the so much to do I am having too much fun just playing around with the program to get any real work done yet. But that could also mean that with so much to do, the possibilities really are endless.My favorite part:The ability to choose from different brushes and types of paper including their textures! For me this was the deal breaker for I can not only customize my color palette but my artwork really looks like I could have done with paint.

$review_text.: While this is a good price, there is a reason for it. For one, the construction isn't very good. It slid off my bed and dropped 2 feet onto the carpet and the lid popped off. It snapped back, but that shouldnt happen.The other problem is (if you are going to use this to charge your android device with a micro USB port) is that the charging port uses the larger micro USB port which means you will always have to remember to carry a separate charger for this.The unfortunate part is that I have to pay the shipping costs to return this.

The high notes are crisper, the lows are deeper, and the overall sound is richer, believe it or not.  AND, the volume gets louder if necessary.  We used if during a party and you would have thought we had a multi speaker, high quality stereo system playing.  It's great that it's so portable too.  A bit heavy with all the batteries in but well worth it. We've had ours for months and are now buying more for the kids.

$REVIEW.: Disappointing at best...  I bought the radio elsewhere.  It looked like a nice, rugged substantial emergency radio.  That's where it stops.  On looks alone, it looks like it can do the job.  Style over substance again.I just purchased the ETON FR1000 Self-Powered Hand-Crank radio for my mom.To my dismay, the ONE feature (AND the one I really needed, and that she'll want) that DID NOT WORK was the radio.  The reception was extremely weak.I next tried to test the radio in various spots in the home to attempt to get a better signal.  As a comparison, I used a cheap 12.00 Sony portable radio to check reception in the same locations.The cheap Sony was able to pick up signals with no effort.  Eton:  Nada...The two function it excels at is 1) flashlight and 2)emitting a loud beep when the knob functions (radio, light, etc.) are changed.  This function cannot be turned off.  Is it for use by sight impaired people?  The front display indicates what mode the radio is in, so that's not it.  Besides the nifty flashlight, WHY does the Eton corp. think people want a loud beep when they reset a knob?I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It's not difficult to get radio reception.  It is definitely NOT a rural area.  One major example- I tried to pick up KGO, which has a strong West Coast signal, and had zero luck whatsoever.  KGO is 45 miles from my home.  Strange.I would think in an emergency, this would be a feature you would truly want- the ability to pick up radio signals easily on an emergency radio.  My Freeplay radio and the pre-mentioned cheap Sony ALL can manage to do a better job than this radio, even with all its looks and other features.I contacted the ETON corporation and dropped off this reject at their offices, since they were local.  Yes, I was that disgusted with this imposter posing as a functional radio.  According to their service department, this is a discontinued model.  Their solution was to trade for an ETON FR360.  I just received it yesterday.  This model worked much better for its purpose and actually had a great tuner.

$REVIEW.: I received my SHARKK Bluetooth speaker yesterday and I've got to say that I'm really very pleased with the quality and build of it all.Let me start off with a bit of a background.  I was looking for a portable bluetooth speaker with a good mic that I could use for conference calls as I'm often traveling to new locations and don't always have the luxury of a dedicated landline.  My primary concern was the quality of the mic and speaker for calls, and of course the overall size of the speaker,  I did a lot of research online and decided that Jawbones were out as they're just too big for me still.  I wanted a speaker that wasn't any bigger than the palm of my hand.  That helped to narrow down the options, and the 2 top contenders seemed the be the SHARKK speaker and Anker's new Cube speaker.  Since I'm a geek, I ended up getting both to try them out side by side.  The SHARKK came fully charged with a 3mm audio cable, mini-USB cable, and a nice carrying bag to keep everything in.I ran both the SHARKK and Anker speakers through the following tests:1. SIZE: Held the speaker in the palm of my hand2. BLUETOOTH CONNECTION: Connected bluetooth speaker to my LG G2 phone3. SPEAKER CLARITY: Played a song at low, medium, and high volume via bluetooth from my LG G24. MAKE CALLS: Made a call out from my LG G2 and spoke at a distance of 1 ft, 2 ft, and 3 ft away.5. RECEIVE CALLS: Received a phone call and picked it up from the speaker while still playing musicHere were the results:+ SIZE: The SHARKK was definitely smaller than the Anker in terms of physical size, but both felt like they were comparable weights.  The SHARKK seemed to have a better build quality as it had a nice metallic casing that felt sturdy, whereas the Anker felt somewhat plasticy in comparison despite it's larger physical size.| = |  BLUETOOTH CONNECTION: Both the SHARKK and Anker were equivalent here.| + |  SPEAKER CLARITY: The SHARKK and Anker were both very impressive in terms of the volume coming out of them given their small size.  I'd actually say the Anker may have been a little louder, but the richness of the treble and bass of the SHARKK just made it sound so much better.| + |  MAKE CALLS: Both speakers worked fine when dialing a call out, and the call volumes were pretty comparable.  That being said, the SHARKK had a significantly better mic sensitivity.  I was able to speak from a distance of 1 ft., 2 ft., and 3 ft. away while still being clear and heard fine by the other party on the line.  The Anker was barely able to pick up my voice at a distance of only 1 ft and it constantly had a strange buzzing noise that the other party on the line noticed (in some cases it completely drowned out my voice) ... this may have been due to a defective product, but it was disappointing nonetheless.| + |  RECEIVE CALLS: The SHARKK again was the victor here.  Both speakers were able to pause the music when I picked up the call via the speaker button, and resume the music when I ended the call via the speaker button.  However, in the case of the SHARKK, when I received an incoming call, the SHARKK would actually say the number of the caller whereas the Anker would just give a generic sounding ring.The SHARKK blew the Anker speaker out of the water for most of the tests.  I would buy this speaker again in a heartbeat.  The only downside that I can think of is that when you power up the phone it makes a loud initialization noise and speaks.  You can lower the volume of the speaker globally, which in turn lowers the tone and voice volume, but it would be nice to be able to configure the volume of the initialization separate from the normal volume of the speaker itself.Overall, if you're looking for a small speaker with exceptional sound output, quality build materials, and a strong mic, then the SHARKK is for you.
$SUMMARY.: Powerful sound, great mic, and all in a nice compact package!

$review_text.: I bought this for my Dad for Christmas


 My parents are not exactly on the leading edge of technology
 They have no internet and they do not have cable
 I needed a DVR that would work without either of those things


 This worked great!  It is not the most user friendly interface, but it is not terrible at all once you get the hang of it.My mom can't stand any techy stuff, so we split the signal from the antenea fed one into the TV like normal and the other went into this little box

 It works great so they can watch TV on the normal HMDI input my mom is used to, and my dad can set up a recording for another channel on the other HDMI input the DVR is connected to

 Require switching inputs but my Dad knows enough to be to keep it straight

 It works wonderfully!



$SUMMARY.: Works wonderfully for a no cable household

$REVIEW.: After finding a good seal using the best fitting tips AND doubling the volume... I found these Etymotic kids earbuds disappointing. The brilliantly clear mid-range is ...well...all that they have to offer. Compared to my Klipsch  S3 in-ear headphones (which cost less), they are missing much of the bass and most of the top end. I have always wanted some Etymotic sound but these puppies are going back. You win some...you lose some I guess.

I have been buying these for several years now and use them every day, multiple times a day. They eventually do wear out but it probably depends on how much you use them. I also have to make sure there are little input plugs on the the phone handset before I change phones. I've had to replace my phones in the past and had to make sure there was an area to plug these into. Would buy again.

$REVIEW.: In my previous review, I gave this Mac mini high marks. After using it for over a month, an issue started to surface. So I downgraded it to three stars. The issue is with the video. There is a random issue with the video that caused an annoying snow on the monitor. After some Google search, as it turns out, the Inter video is the culprit and Apple has known of this issue. It is not a big issue but nonetheless it is very very annoying. When I buy an Apple product I expect nothing less then perfection, I can't believe Apple knowingly release an imperfect product. May be Apple is turning into a garbage Windows PC maker like Dell, HP... >:-(

$review_text.: The Sony A33 (A55) Not is not exactly What I expected .... the good and not so goodFirst of all this camera is a great movie camera with continuous auto focus and an good photo camera.The reason I say good and not great is because if you intend on shooting in any of the 3 auto modes you are not going to get great photos the same as you would get with a Canon T1I, T2i or canon G10. But the photos are more predictable in auto than with the Canon'sThe kit lens is good, does not have much range but works well even though its a cheap kit lens. Better than the t2iThe body is plastic therefore lightThe fold down LCD is a winner although a little small.Viewfinder is a real treat giving you the same read out info as the LCDSwitches automatically back and forth from LCD to viewfinder as you place your eye close or take it away from the viewfinder.Or you can easily switch between LCD screen and viewfinder by pushing the  LCD/viewfinder button.If you have a big lens or a lens hood the flash may cast a shadow in your photoI have large hands but the body is very comfortable to holdControls are easy to reach but again these cameras are are far to complicated than they need to be need, but that is where technology takes you.I did not see the battery life as being an issue - My G10 is much better.Charging takes 4 hours per battery so get yourself a another battery and maybe an extra charger.I specifically bought the a33 because I did not want the GPS sucking the life out of my battery as I learned on a Panasonic Z10.My travels do not take to normal tourist data base gps way points so I felt it was of no use to me. Another thing to break downUsed Minolta AF lenses work great and are half the price as new Sony ones and are of equal or superior quality. Many of the Sony lenses on Amazon are just rebranded Minolta lenses.The a33 and a55 uses Steadytshot an in camera stabilizationLenses for this camera are not stabilized which is good and badGood because the lenses are cheaper and lighterBad because the stabilization in the camera is not as reliable as say CanonWhen you take a photo you cannot just press the shutter all the way down quickly.You have to press halfway wait for the steadyshot indicator to drop to one bar, wait for the focus beep and then press all the wayCanon seems quicker?The A33 could be less noisier (photo wise not sound wise) than the a55 because it packs less pixels on the same size sensorAn Azden SMX-10 mic $65 from Amazon is a great accessory. It takes the mic out of the body to minimize the focus noise of the lenses and adds stereo.Alert the hot shoe on this camera is a proprietary one meaning you need an adapter to hook on a regular shoal For $12 the Seagull SC-5 Hot Shoe Adapter to Standard Flash Shoe with PC Connection - for Konica Minolta Maxxum & Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras works from AmazonAt about 10 minutes of using the video it shuts down from overheating and you cannot film until it cools and then it will only go for a few minutes and will shut down again. I luckily only shoot short clips so its not an issue but Sony made a statement below.Sony has issued a statement concerning an overheating issue with the new Sony A55 and A33 translucent mirror cameras.The problem arises from the CMOS sensor overheating in certain temperature ranges.  Sony has put together a chart that provides an idea of max recording times under certain environmental conditions.  You can check it out on the web. They have no solution only shoot less than 10 minutes with stabilization on.Image stabilization is a big problem for shooting long clips.5D Mark II and 7D cameras shutdown from overheating also so it's nothing unique to Sony.This review could also be for the a55 since they are almost identical except for a55 --* gives you faster continuous shooting,* GPS* higher megapixel.* priceand a few other minor thingsI have come to admire this little piece of techno. I have so many Minolta lenses that I purchased from ebay that I have purchased a second a33 so I must give it a 5 although there is always room for improvement and nothing is perfect.On Ebay you can get aMinolta 50MM F/1.7 prime for circa $73Minolta 100 mm f/2.8 Macro The sharpest lens Minolta has ever made for less than $300Minolta 100-300 APO Zoom $220Be careful of the new 8mm Fisheye from Korea that is marketed for Sony under different names for $230-$330 It is not compatible with a33 or a55

$REVIEW.: These speakers sound really well for the price!The tweeter is a bit on the bright side, but still good sounding.You'll immediately notice the quality drivers in this cabinet!Too bad only 2 of them are real drivers, the others are passive drivers.These cabinets shine by themselves. Because of the passive drivers there's some booming lows, but no real deep lows.Also pairing it with a subwoofer is rather difficult, because of phase issues with the low frequencies between these speakers, and the subwoofers or speakers of other kind. For that reason, if you plan on pairing these speakers, just pair them with the same kind only.Also, I get great results with this amp:LP-2020A+ Lepai Tripath Class-T Hi-Fi Audio Mini Amplifier with Power SupplyThe overall sound is a bit on the bright side, doubtless it's the amps fault, but also the slightly bright tuned cabinet in combination with the brighter amp.Both are a perfect combination for a stereo Home Theater.The amp uses only 4Watts of power on the AC, and the speakers sound awesome, on volume levels just topping normal conversation!Even at 10W this setup can be very loud!I also tested these speakers with a 100W power amp, and they can get really loud; but I prefer my LP2020 amp.

$REVIEW.: I'm not going to write a long review about all of the great stuff this camera does - and it is great -- rather I'm going to write about the one thing that bothers me most: The lack of the ability to connect a PC by Wi-Fi.I don't have a tablet because I'm a computer programmer and I always have a laptop.  That's not good for me and my Nikon AW110 because the Wi-Fi only works with smart devices.  The reason is because the Nikon AW110 is a base station that your smart device connects to the same way you would connect to a Wi-Fi network.Unfortunately, when you try to connect to the camera by Wi-Fi from a laptop PC, the connection never completes.  Even if it did, you wouldn't have an App to control the camera from a PC.Nikon could have made this work the same way on the PC as it does on smart devices but for whatever reason they chose not to.  Minus 2 stars because this is the main reason I bought this brand and camera model.I guess I'll have to buy a cheap tablet and see if I can get it to auto upload from the camera to SkyDrive or similar.  I'll update the review if I get that working.

LP highest goes up to 150hz for the subwoofer. front and rear can have separate HP starting at 50hz. standard EQ3 controls with a couple presents. i put a dvd in just to see ti work and it works well with good clarity. the main menu is customizable which i find very nice. so far ive had a great experience with this stereo and will update if anything changesSystem SpecsDeck: Kenwood DDX770Front Stage: Rockford Fosgate T2652Rear Stage: Rockford Fosgate T1693Speaker Amp: Rockford Fosgate T-600.4Wiring: KnuKonceptz Kolossus 0 gauge OFC Dual Amp KitSub Amp: Rockford Fosgate T-1500bdcpSubwoofer: 12&#34; Fi Q D2 1500 with custom options

$review_text.: The battery is labeled as a genuine Dell battery so the price is great and the battery has worked just fine.  I'm very happy with it.  My only concern (and the reason for the 4 stars vs. 5) is that,while docked, I've noticed the battery status lights alternately blinking amber light with steady blue light which means &#34;Temporary battery failure with AC adapter present&#34;.  I don't understand what this means and it stops after some time. I've notice it two or three times.  So, the 4 stars is only based on my cautionary nature regarding the status light.  This may be perfectly normal... perhaps somethng to do with the docking station power supply which is a higher voltage than the regular power suppy.  But to be clear, the battery has been as I would expect from a new Dell battery.

$REVIEW.: I have owned a Kindle Paperwhite (stolen) and then decided to give the Kobo Glo a chance (and I love Amazon, just like checking out the little guys every once in awhile).  When all things are equal, which they are for ereaders; then go with the company with the best customer service.  You will be happy that you did!!  I read that the screen was brighter, micro SD memory slot, and that it plays all formats.  Hear are the facts:1. You will be happy with all of the screens.  They are all super bright and can be seen in ALL situations.2. Size: They are all small and easy to carrying, hold etc3. Formats: Use Calibre and you can add any format to any device.  If you buy all your books then use nook or kindle as their library is more extensive4. Size: No need for microSD, book sizes are small.Here is the only thing to consider: If something goes wrong, can I get in touch with customer service and will they work with me to get make things right?Amazon has some of the best customer service in the business.  They are easy to reach and even easier to provide an RMA.  Amazon is the type of company to fix your product or issue regardless of the fine print in their own policies.The screen on my Kobo Glo just froze.  They asked for a picture and determined that there was screen damage.  This device has not been dropped, stepped on, scratched or otherwise.  The physical screen is in perfect shape, yet they are not going to fix it.  Amazon would have considered the upside to keeping a customer in the kindle line, buying books on their store and fixed the device.Bottom line, go with the Kindle because of the superior customer service.  The only thing that can interrupt your reading experience is if the device does work and no one will fix it.
$SUMMARY.: All in all, the kindle, Kobo, and Nook are the same.  Read to find out how to choose:

$REVIEW.: This is my must-have on my triathlon bike. I lock it on the bottle holder and play music when I ride on the country road. This is a very safe alternative to ear bud when I do outdoor training. It is loud but won't cover the sound from the car approaching behind.This product is great when it play music in the open space. Once it standup with the subwoofer atop, it boost up the mood of my several bbq party.The bass is ok and treble is quite crispy. I usually listen to light music with this device so bass is not what I am looking for on this speaker. Bluetooth connection is stable and very easy even I switch between my mac and cell phone very often.So far I haven't found anything that I do not like about this machine. Maybe the only shortcoming is bass won't be as good as BOSE for those techno and strong drum beat song lovers.For the battery, I think the device goes for at least 7 hrs with moderate sound level. I am quite satisfied with the battery life so far.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to run HDMI from my upstairs entertainment system to my downstairs monitor and figured 50 ft would do, but I underestimated the amount of cable that would be eaten up by walls and twisting and routing where I could and what not, so I wound up having to get an extra 25ft cable, with which I also purchased an HDMI coupler.Well, it worked at first and I had a great picture, but when I would turn off the monitor downstairs and turn it back on it wouldn't come on right away and would take many minutes, sometimes with sudden loud bursts of static or intermittant pictures from the HDMI.  sometimes if I unhooked the coupler and rehooked it up again it would work again, but hit was hit or miss and I gave up for a while.Well, I decided to make it work so I ordered this unit to replace the coupler, and it worked flawlessly, the picture is crystal clear 1080p and it comes on every time.The device itself is very small, seems well made, and comes with 2 small brackets that can be mounted on the sides for wall mounting.  There is a rotary dial which I assume is the gain, but I only glanced at what little instructions there were as it was working without messing with anything.  There is a port for an option 5V power supply, but the instructions say this is usually not needed as the device is powered by the HDMI (as it was in my case).

$REVIEW.: I first bought the 32 gb model from Best Buy, and it had a dead pixel on the screen.  I spent about 90 minutes with blackberry's customer service on the phone, and they offered to replace it but first had me reinstall the software, twice.  They thought that somehow this would fix a dead pixel.  Anyway, who has hours to waste on the phone?  I don't.  Then I couldn't get any laptop in the house to recognize the device properly.  No issues with any other USB devices.  Anyway they had me delete and reinstall the same version of their blackberry desktop software, which took another hour or so.  No dice, still can't recognize it properly.  It could be my laptop, but again I've had no problems with other devices.  I was able to install 1 movie on it, and although the quality was very good on my laptop it wasn't that clear on the blackberry.  Not sure why because the preinstalled sample 3 minute movie is super clear with very high resolution.  After this movie was installed, nothing else would install, and my laptop wouldn't recognize it again.  It was sort of a fluke that it worked.I returned it to Best Buy and got my money back.  They were sold out due the deep price reduction.  Then I bought the 64 gb model off Amazon, no dead pixels but still can't get it to work with my laptop, maybe the issue is with my laptop.  As far as the device is concerned it has a lightning fast internet browser, probably as fast as my laptop for most sites.  The camera was okay, but I used it indoors: may work better outdoors in sunlight.  The preinstalled car racing game wasn't very good, in my opinion. If you are curious about the sound I thought the speakers worked really well for the size of this tablet.  Unfortunately, and I knew this going in it doesn't do Netflix or Skype and there are very few apps that you can get right now.  If I could get my own movies to load on this, I might consider keeping it.  But I'd rather spend a few hundred more and get something that does what I want it to do.  If you don't care about Netflix or Skype and you can get it to work with your computer then it might be right for you.  Pretty good price, very nice screen and fast internet over wifi.  Last thing as noted by many other reviewers is the power button. It didn't seem too bad on the 32 gb model, but on this 64 gb it's really difficult to turn it off and on with the power button.  Yes you can swipe to wake up the tablet, but there will be times you will be forced to power on or off with the button, and it's annoying.  I thought others were just whining about silly things, but this is quite a pain.  By the way I bought the "used" model from Amazon's Warehouse deals and I'm pretty sure it's brand new.  No signs that the box had ever been opened.  So if you are going to buy one, be confident in Amazon's "like new" warehouse deal, as it may actually be brand new, and you get some good savings.

$review_text.: I do quite of bit of running and cycling. It wasn't until recently that I thought of purchasing a bluetooth headset to workout. After doing a bit of research, I narrowed it down to the Jabra Sport, Jaybird JF3 and Nokia BH505. All headsets were impressive and reviews were fair, but my local bestbuy just so happened to have the Jaybirds in stock, and since I couldn't wait another day to get my hands on this new toy, I jumped the gun and got them.Fit - I have small ears and the Jaybirds provide a great selection of eartips and hooks. Overall, I found them to stay in place really well and they're so light and comfortable, you kinda forget you have them on. It's almost as if an invisible speaker is following you around.Sound - I'm not one to listen to music very loud, so I can't fully attest to the quality of the sound. However, to my untrained ears, it sounds fantastic with a warm, rich bass while hitting highs very clearly. It also blocks out noise pretty well, but not so much that you won't be able to hear a car honking at your because he's about to run into you.Controls - There are 3 buttons on the right earphone but they provide more than a dozen functions. They can play/pause, answer/hang up calls, volume +/-, next/previous track, mute/unmute, etc. The buttons are easy to push and make a satisfying "click" when pushed.Compatible devices - I'm only using it with my Motorola Droid X and MacBook Pro. All controls work well with these devices.Cons - My only complain is the fact that you can only pair the headset with 2 devices. I've got a personal and work laptop, phone, tablet and ipod touch and would like to pair it with all of them! Having a 2 device limit is kinda lame, but oh well.In the end, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless headset solution when exercising.
$SUMMARY.: Best bluetooth headset for music and working out

$REVIEW.: I used this adapter for Thinkpad t60/t60p/t61 running both XP and Windows 7 to Panasonic Viera TV.  It works but required some adjusting of settings to display correctly.  This device uses the Displaylink software/drivers so you should download and install the latest software from Displaylink website before attaching the device to the USB port.  You can only adjust the settings when the device is attached to the USB and TV HDMI port.  Open up the system tray icon which appears after attaching the device to adjust settings.  The first setting to adjust is "Fit to TV" option. A window will appear on your TV which you can stretch horizontally and vertically to fill the TV screen.  On my setup the computer screen would only appear on the TV when I selected the "Notebook Monitor Off" option.  I could not find any way to get the display to appear on both my computer and TV.  I then selected the optimize for video option since I planned on playing video clips from my computer.  For the Windows 7 operating system you must have an Aero Theme enabled to be able to play videos using Windows Media Player or VLC Media player.  You cannot use any of the classic or basic themes.  However you can tweak the Aero settings in control panel>system>advanced system settings>advanced tab>performance settings and set to custom and uncheck all but the bottom 4 settings plus (importantly) the fifth setting "enable desktop composition". This must be enabled for video to play on the TV. I discovered that the free VLC Media Player does a much better job rendering video on the TV than Windows Media Player so you should download and install the VLC Media Player if you are not happy with the video using WMP or any other player you may be using.

$review_text.: I had this router set up in minutes. It could hardly have been easier. I think about all of the time I spent on the setup of my old 802.11g router, and I am thankful that technology has become easier to deal with.I set up the 5 GHZ and 2.4 GHZ networks and connected my devices wirelessly. My laptop is about 35 feet away with a couple of walls in between, and the 5 GHZ network signal alternates between Very Good and Excellent. If I connect the laptop from more than about 50 feet, the signal drops to Good, and it gets iffy around 65 feet.I can't believe how this has improved my 2.4 GHZ range. I have a Roku Radio set up downstairs and on the other side of the house from the router. With my old Linksys Wireless G router, the Roku was getting signals in the -75 dBM range at best. In fact, it dropped out quite a bit, and I got a range extender and set it up downstairs fairly close to the radio. That improved the signal to an average of about -50 dBM. When I set up this new router in the same place as the Linksys, I got rid of the range extender, and checked the Roku signal. It had improved to -43 dBM. I couldn't believe it, so I checked it several other times over the next few days. The worst signal I got was -49 dBM. The signal quality hovers around 99% which is also much better than it was with the old router and range extender (90% or so).The Quality Of Service (QOS) features of the router work great as well. You can set it up using MAC addresses, ports, or a few other criteria. I connected my Ooma phone system to a port and tested it out. I was getting some latency and annoying feedback. I then set up the QOS for that port to give it "highest" priority. I checked the phones again, and they were as clear as a bell. I had not experienced VoIP that clearly until that point.This router has easily handled everything we've thrown at it. I was using my laptop to wirelessly backup my desktop while one kid was wirelessly streaming Netflix using the Roku Netflix player, the other was using his iPod Touch on WiFi, and my wife was on the Ooma phone. Nobody had any hiccups at all. I'm very satisfied with this purchase, and I hope it remains reliable.

$review_text.: Since computer manufacturers have made increasingly form-factor boxes (I'm looking at you, Apple), sales of external CD/DVD multi's have gone up.  I took an old CD-R that was kind-of-but-not-really scratched and put it in this thing, and it wouldn't read at all.  I then tried the old toothpaste trick, and it still wouldn't read.  I then put it into my PS3, the only device left from the era when companies still made good devices, and it read the music files immediately and without issue.  I was able to copy the music (an instrumental my dad made) to a flash drive.When I my old, fat PS3 works better as a CD reader than a dedicated CD reader, that's when it gets one star.  Nice try, Amazon.  This is a fail.

$REVIEW.: This is my 3rd generation PowerShot camera and I think this one is the best yet. I went from the SD400 (loved it), to the SD1400 (annoyed the crap out of me!), to this new Elph 100 HS. After just 5 minutes with the 100 HS, I KNEW it was going to be awesome, and it has been. Well worth the money and in blue, it looks spectacular! By the way, the Case Logic TBC-302 case fits it perfectly!Update: I've now had the camera for a few weeks and have taken about a hundred pictures and a dozen videos with it and I absolutely LOVE IT! It takes exceptional low-light pictures (WAY better than the SD1400!) and it also balances the flash fantastically well. I've yet to take a picture that is washed out by the flash. Every picture, in any light, seems perfectly balanced and well...perfect. LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera and can't recommend highly enough (not to mention once again, looks fantastic in blue!)

$REVIEW.: I can not say that this product is not leather. I can't say that it is. The package, which is in Chinese says PU leather, but my nose, and hands tell me that it is leather. In fact this is the exact same strap that is being sold close to $50 bucks on amazon. You can find it if you look for it. This product is embossed with the word Leuna.I like it a lot. The construction is of high quality. The stitching is tight and well aligned. The metal tripod mount is heavy and the whole package has a nice fit and finish. There is no doubt that this looks good and seems to be of enough quality to last a long time.However, my only issue is that this is designed to cover the knuckles of the hand, and not the back of the hand itself. this does not lend to a very good grip in my opinion. The tripod mount loosens quickly when being hand held and if yo want the strap to cover the back f the hand the tripod mount must swivel a bit. I may be a bit OCD, but that bugs me.Either way you slice it, for $12 including shipping this is a great buy. I like it.

$REVIEW.: I recently got two of the Verso covers and overall I am really liking the quality of them.  There is a nice heft and weight to the cover that makes it feel substantial.  The interior is very soft so you don't have to worry about scratches and provides a bit of padding and protection.  I like the neat little pouch for notes etc.  Also I like the fact that the spine of the cover has a very generous hinge area.  I can slip a clip light in there and still close the cover over the kindle comfortably.The design, a mock of a old-fashioned leather hard-cover book, is quite handsome.  It has a weathered look almost to make you feel like you are holding an old book in your hand.  Very handsome and very functional.

$review_text.: Got a new LG 50" plasma, so I thought it would be best to get a LG Blu-ray player.  I was skittish due to the reviews on here, but took a chance anyway.  Set up the player and everything worked perfectly, Netflix and all.  What was wrong with all those reviewers?  Then the problems started with Netflix.  First, a simple off and on would get it back to working.  Not ideal, but I could live with that occasionally.  Then Netflix would not work no matter what, off/on, deactivate/reactivate and it could not have happened at a worst time, a planned movie night.  Amazon worked but did not have the desired movie.  Ok, everybody has a bad day, I was willing to forgive and try again on another day.  Well, that day came and another day and another day, still could not get Netflix to work.  Amazon, Pandora worked fine but not Netflix.  I don't know if it was one of those notorious firmware updates but Netflix would do everything as if working then give me the message, "We're having trouble playing this title right now.  Please try again later or select a different title."  However, it did not matter what title was selected.  Netflix worked just fine on our desktop, laptop, iPad, and Panasonic Blu-ray player in another room.  No problems with Blu-ray and DVD play.Unfortunately, I do not believe I have any choice but to send this player back.  Maybe, I will go for an exchange first but if that turns out bad I guess I will have to give up on this player.****************************4-23-12Gave it one final Netflix test this morning. No go.  Started the return process, new player on the way, old one on its way back to Amazon.  Hopefully, the new one will work out.****************************5-1-12Received replacement quickly.  Thanks Amazon.  First streaming Netflix movie went without a hitch.  Second movie was continually glitchy, though not enough of a sample size to effectively judge.  Better than the first one, but I will be holding on to the box.****************************5-15-12Replacement has gone belly up as well.  This time it would not even eject the disc, had to take it apart to get it out.  Sending back and will be getting a refund this time.  Worked well for a minute, then went into permanent "boot" only mode.  LG obviously has some serious QC issues with this product.  I'm surprised Amazon still sells it.  It has to be a PITA for them also.

$REVIEW.: I got this quickly and for the money I spent on it, it has GREAT sound. I bought something similar a while back (but I do not think it was Bluetooth capable) that sounds like garbage compared to this. The blue light is VERY bright, so this might not be good for bedtime music, but I am very happy with it overall. I had a little trouble figuring out how to get it paired with my phone, but I am sure that had more to do with my lack of technical expertise than it had to do with the system in any way. The only thing that would make it even better for me would be if it came with a remote control... I have it in a small cubicle shelf, so it is a little inconvenient to access the buttons on top since the shelf is only about an inch and a half above it. Anyway, I like it a lot... will be getting one for my kitchen and probably another for my living room (and just throw that other one I have in the trash where it belongs!)

$review_text.: I am a big fan of Logitech products, although in recent years I've been really impressed with the Microsoft line of PC peripherals. I was still curious to find out how does Logitech Touch Mouse T620 perform with Windows 8, a heavily touch oriented OS. Overall it's a decent mouse, but it has enough of problems that I would not really recommend it for heavy Windows 8 users.ProsIt looks cool. The mouse is beautiful, and it is right at place in any work environment, even an artsy designer studio.Solid build. Logitech products have always symbolized quality of workmanship and materials, and this mouse is no exception.Works with both Windows 8 and Windows 7. As already mentioned, Windows 8 supports all sorts of new navigation gestures and this mouse was able to use all of them straight out of box. It also performed well with all the Windows 7 gesture-based tasks (scrolling, etc.).ConsSmall. From the point of ergonomics as well as pointing precision I much prefer larger and bulkier mice. Logitech mice tend to be on a smaller side. My favorite mice are still designed in Redmond.Wireless dongle. I am a big fan of Bluetooth peripherals. Wireless dongles, even when they are as small as this one, occupy unnecessary space and are easily lost or misplaced when traveling.Uneven performance on various surfaces. Over the years I've gotten used to laser mice becoming more and more sophisticated when used on a variety of surfaces. My Microsoft mouse can even be used on glass. This Logitech mouse, however, can be very finicky and particular about the surface on which it is used.Touch surface too sensitive. It seems that it's very easy to make a wrong gesture with this mouse. You also can't rest your hand on the mouse even for a short bit. This seems to be a generic problem with touch mice, which is why I am not a big fan of this kind of peripheral device to begin with.ConclusionI approached this mouse with an open mind, but its small size, touch oversensitivity, and the inability to work on a variety of surfaces made me less than enthusiastic about it. If you want to make the most out of the touch features in Windows 8 I recommend that you look intoLogitech Touchpad. For me personally working with a touchpad and a mouse at the same time provides the best combination of features and efficiency.

Seriously, AMAZING bass.Let's go to Sound QualitySound Quality: ~Treble: good.....(Skullcandy equivalent Quality, awesome)Mids: better.....(still awesome Skullcandy Quality)Bass: Holy S%*#!!(Better than Skullcandy :D)To describe the Bass: face melting, body tingling, earth shattering, pant soiling, etc...overall, effing awesome.I use the large inserts because 1. since i first started using earbuds over a year ago, I think my ear canal got a bit bigger so it could get used to the earbuds, and 2, i like  noise cancellation, and you hear more bass with the bigger inserts, they're awesome!.Here are some artists: (mainly Electronic, Dance, Techno, Trance, Dubstep) that sound awesome with these earbuds:Skrillex, Bassnectar, Deadmau5, Doctor P, Flux Pavillion, and Ellie Goulding (mainly Bassnectar Remixes)Please Comment on what artists sound amazing with these earbudsThe only thing that I wish came with the earbuds was a Wicked audio logo on an epic sticker.Anyway, hope this helps.

$review_text.: This wireless trigger is solid, well built and I haven't had a misfire yet.  I have tried it all over the house upstairs, downstairs, different rooms and it has always fired.  It doesn't lock onto the camera hot shoe but it fits snugly enough with no play so that's not a problem for me.  You cannot turn them off or on with the flash mounted and you cannot fire a flash with the remote as other reviewers have mentioned, you have to fire it off the camera but neither of these issues are deal breakers and for the price I can live with them but for those reasons I only rated them 4 stars.An unexpected bonus is being able to fire my camera remotely via the GPS connection.  I mount my camera on a tripod by my bird feeders and can fire it from inside the house.  I have had so much fun with them that I have ordered another set.  For $29 you can't go wrong.

$REVIEW.: This is a well designed bag... it fits my Sony DSLR + 2 Minolta lenses very well and offers great protection.  I love the fact that it has room for my iPad, iPhone, and and cash etc.It is not too big and not too small and I really like the fact that you can side-load it or have it from the top.It is comfortable to carry due to the sling design though the strap does tend to have a relatively sharp edge -- a strap cover would not be a bad investment.  It is great to travel with when you are limited to carry on's on airlines.It is built to last for years and wherever you throw into it or at it.  Overall, it is great -- you will need to be relatively disciplined in terms of what you put in it - it is like a bottomless pit of a purse where you can pack for a weekend.  But it will keep you organized and serve you well whether you are out on a hike or trekking through the city.[NCJVR]

$review_text.: I was skeptical when I bought this, but one use converted me.I am so used to using mutliple screens, that traveling with just my laptop screen is really a hassle when trying to do work.This screen is a wonderful answer to that issue.  It is relately light and compact. It is very thin.  Anytime I use it I have people ask about it out of surprise at how good it looks.  And--no power cord needed!  It runs off of the USB port for both power and video signal.  Only one cord is needed (and supplied with the unit).A couple notes for other buyers:The &#34;stand&#34; is very basic.  I would not recommend this as an everyday secondary screen--more for travel or students.The cord is a USB cord, but there is nothing on the unit to store the cord.  That is one thing that could have been better, but it is a minor issue.In airports, you MAY have to take it out since some TSA think it is a computer.A great unit!

Run the program on SSD and save file to standard hard drive in the expense of giving up the DVD burner.Con: Macbook OS is not design run 2 hard drive, it will not effect the system operation. But, the 2nd drive will operate full time and result poor battery life. For people operate in different platform require install BootCamp, the installation need to be run from internal DVD drive, external USB DVD drive WILL NOT WORK.Other: Easy to install, take 10-15 min, difficulty a bit harder to replace battery in average house TV remote. Is ideal for SSD MacBook do to lack of saving space. It is up to personal preference the balance between storage and battery life.

$review_text.: I initially purchased these headphones for use on my moped. I have a full-face helmet with a flip up chin guard but unfortunately it generates a lot of wind noise when riding. I was able to put these headphones on and slip a helmet over top without discomfort. They cut the noise levels down tremendously although the fact I can't hear vehicle engines at all means a bit more work for the eyes.The real revelation for me was taking these on a plane. Without being plugged in to anything they immediately cancel all the noise you normally hear. I was sitting at a window seat beside the engine when we took off and could barely hear a thing. Plugged in to the entertainment system they allowed me to hear the programs clearly without having to crank the volume. If you have ever used the headphones the airlines give out you know what I'm talking about. Wearing my Bose QC20 was the difference between a loud conversation at a bar and sitting in the symphony.I work in an open-office environment where sometime concentrating can be difficult with several people speaking at once. All I have to do is put these babies on, tune in to my favorite chillout track from di.fm (at low volume) and I literally can't hear anyone else around me. Its like my own portable privacy booth.The manufacturing quality seems really good so far and I've been using them every day for the past month. The cord is very flexible and feels high quality. The connections around the battery pack are reinforced to prevent wear and tear. The ear buds themselves are the usual high quality Bose tech.There is a button to turn noise cancelling on/off. If you just put the buds in without turning on the device, there is a noticeable muting effect. Turn the device on and shut noise cancelling off and its almost like you don't have the earbuds in at all. This is useful when you are getting ready to go somewhere, have put the buds in, but someone wants to talk. However I found I could not ride with noise cancelling off as the wind noise was still very loud.In short, this is a fantastic device. Time will tell how long it lasts.

I didn't much care at first for the way the receiver is attached to a cord, but I think this feature will come in handy in the long run. I can attach it to a back port and then put it anywhere I need to. This frees up the side port. I agree with pretty much everyone else, the side buttons are useless. I just disabled them. So far I haven't had any problems with erroneous messages (keeping fingers crossed). Someone else mentioned theirs came with Intellipoint 5.5 software, but mine has 6.1. Hopefully they have upgraded and eliminated some of the bugs. All in all I like it, but for the money it could be better.

$review_text.: I previously owned a SD500, and have been looking for better features such as larger screen, wider zoon, higer ISO speed, etc
 And found SD750, I own it now
 Wow, it is very nice design of the body, slimmer than SD500
 Huge 3" LCD screen, color display on screen is near original(Not just my feel, also few other friends said so)
 Use the dial technology similiar to the iPod's dial to switch the shoot modes, but you may take some time to get used to it

3x optical 35-105mm zoom is better than SD500, but I wish it can go wider to 28mm like SD800 IS
SD750 has DIGIC III processor


 Can use SDHC card but I hear it may cause bottleneck, so I continue using the 2GB highspeed to hold over 600 pics in highest setting

 Movie shooting is great even inside the restaurant at night time


 It can also record your voice to each picture
 Battary life is not as good as SD500

But it still takes about 150 pictures in a full charge


Recommend to have a backup when you go traveling

 No complaint for the 3" LCD
 Oh, one good feature in this camera is it has an easy button to review the pictures, press the shutter to return to shooting mode
 This is way better than SD500


 It's one of the best so far

Highly recommend if you are looking for a compact, easy-use camera that take quality pictures
 Good luck.Added: This is just on my own preference, I have the silver version

 I like this version better than the black version, unless Canon makes the whole camera body black
 Another feature I use on this camera is: I can set the folder to be created on daily base, instead of seeing the picture's property for the picture day, it groups all pictures took at the same day to one folder.

$review_text.: I first looked at the UD5 and UD7


 I decided to go with this board because, when doing the product comparison, those more expensive models really don't add that much more value to justify the price


 One thing it's missing is 1394 port but I just bought a $20 1394 PCIe card to handle my video import for my HD camcorder.I installed this into my HAF 922 mid tower chassis and had no problems whatsoever

 The back panel fit perfectly (ATX) into the chassis back slot and the SATA 3 6 GB/s ports are awesome
 The BIOS is top notch and it comes with software that "safely" does the OC for you.The PCI slots are a little tight--especially if you plan on using a fat GPU


 I installed a GeForce GTX 560 and it took up two back panel slots

 I know that the ATX form factor limits what the manufacturer can do--however, it seemed they could have squeezed a few more millimeters between the PCIe x16 and PCIe x1 slots.Overall, I recommend this MOBO for novice to intermediate DIY people.

$review_text.: Samsung uses an absurdly tiny diameter barrel connector for the S5 Chromebooks, and since it sticks straight out from the case, it is fragile, and subject to damage. After a year of use, mine fatigued inside the plastic cover, and power  became erratic. The Pwr+ Ac Adapter Charger uses a 90-degree connector, at the end of a longer power cord, and should be more durable. The transformer is exactly the same size as the OEM unit, but has a blue indicator light. Superior design in every way.

It was ready to go and easy to operate
This was my first tablet

I have a moderate knowledge base regarding computers as I was a technology coordinator for a small educational cooperative for several years.I went into the settings, found my router and connected
 The tablet indicated that I was connected


 I went to Google and it loaded
 I typed in "horse" and got a search page for horses


The connection was dropped
I could not search for another term nor could I access msn or yahoo

 It continued to indicate that I was connected to my router.I tried changing configurations on my router to no avail
 The tablet could find my router, would indicate that I was connected, but would not access the internet

During this mess, I went to tablet forums and found out that this was a problem with a few of the Le Pan TC970s

It is not a common occurance or there would be lower ratings
The problem has to do with tablet compatibility with the routers


With no small amound of sadness I requested an RMA, sent it back and ordered an Amazon Fire.

$REVIEW.: I purchased a 25 and 125 foot cable to upgrade my home LAN from Cat5e to Cat6a


 I have a new TV that can stream from a DLNA server, so I implemented a Synology NAS and decided to ensure the network will run fast

 I actually ran a packet test after installing the new cables, and the speed did increase according to the test results

 My understanding is that Cat5e can run as fast as 6a, but is more susceptible to speed loss due to interference and cross talk


 Also, Cat 6a is certified to run at higher frequencies and will support Gigabit Ethernet
 Keep in mind that you'll have to upgrade your switches to Gigabit Ethernet as well, the network will only run as fast as the slowest component


 I am quite pleased with these cables, they do not seem to be any larger in diameter, or any stiffer than the cables they replaced
 I subsequently purchased some shorter CableMatters cables to connect devices to the switches.

$review_text.: As a retired hardware designer, I have to take issue with the review which takes a gratuitous swipe at Crucial, lest some avoid buying from an excellent vendor.  In general, Crucial (Micron) is well regarded as a quality provider of memory devices.  Crucial is not who I think of when I look for a "least cost source".  In fact, I was just pricing this same memory at Crucial for my home Apple G5 Xserve - and while I haven't yet made a close check of the specs, the Crucial price was almost double the price of the Kingston. In the case of the "lab" the reviewer worked for trying to cut costs, it seems more likely that the cost differential (i.e. the Crucial price being lower) was a result of an error in selecting the correct memory for the system in use, than that it was a result of Crucial being a price leader.  The fact that ALL of the Crucial parts generated a "blue screen" outcome borders on demonstrative proof of an error in specifying the part.  It is unfortunate that we do not have all of the facts in hand so that we could validate this reported issue, but until something persuades me otherwise I will continue to look at Crucial as a provider of choice.  I believe that you will find many others with significant expertise in this area share this view.  Unfortunately, many consumers mis-understand some of the specs, or make other errors that cause them problems, and then blame the vendor.  Even many who consider themselves "technical" know less about the topic than they might imagine, and to be fair to them, it can be a fairly complex body of information.  To the commenter who asked about Corsair, they are not a memory manufacturer like Crucial/Micron, they are a wholesaler/branding company.  IIRC, they purchase primarily from Micron (i.e. Crucial) and Samsung.  Since their target demographic seems to be the "performance" crowd, I would expect their products would be fine, and I believe I may even have some of their memory in a couple of my personal systems.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  As a final observation regarding Crucial, I have a number of servers running with 16 gb each of Crucial ram running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and I have no complaints with the product.  I have also used Kingston from time to time when that was what was readily available and have had no complaints with them, but I still have a preference for Crucial in mission critical applications.  YMMV.

I have a Klipsch Ultra 5.1 surround set up with an HT Omega Claro plus audio card so I feel confident in anything I am able to reproduce. Most microphones are able to capture 85% of what they pick up as a faithful reproduction. That being said, these speakers were installed in the rear deck of a 2003 Crown Victoria. Huge trunk equals massive bass without a box. Using an Alpine head unit rated at 18 watts these speakers produce sound that would make any normal person swear there is a sub box in the trunk! They are able to produce such clarity on such low power that I am ready to add some amplification. These have great reviews on the net and all the reviewers say the same thing: " these were awesome until I added and amplifier of at least 90wpc then these became amazing ". Great build quality and they sound better than Infinity, Pioneer, Sony, MB Quart, Mission speakers of twice the price. If you are on the fence, get off and buy these, you won't be sorry.
$SUMMARY.: Blown away by the bass and clarity

$review_text.: This lens is amazing!  I just recently bought the Pentax K10D, my first dSLR, because I wanted to take better pictures indoors.  I purchased the camera without the kit lens and bought the FA 50mm f/1.4 instead.  The difference between my new camera/lens and my "Advanced Compact Super-zoom" (Canon S2 IS) is night and day.  I used to take hundreds of shots in continuous mode to get a few sharp ones -- which were still rather noisy.  With this lens I get sharp pictures indoors without using a flash.This is a great lens for head shots indoors.  It is a moderate telephoto on a dSLR (due to the smaller sensor), so it is sometimes difficult/impossible to move back enough to get a full body shot in a smaller room.  Depending on your needs you may prefer the "normal" view that the 35mm f/2 would provide -- but that lens costs about 50% more.I am loving this lens.  I find myself using it at about f/2.8 most of the time, thus far (to keep the subject's entire head in focus).
$SUMMARY.: Wonderful Lens

$review_text.: The 2 connectors that come with the kit are for a USB port and a SD card
 The SD card works fine even though Apple needs to do some work with their software as the pictures transferred are forced into 1 folder which you cannot rename nor can you transfer via the iPad 2.The second connector I have found useless
 The main reason was to transfer pictures or data from a flash drive with a USB to the iPad


 Every flash drive I used, I got an error message that said the iPad did not have the power to run the USB drive

 Not exactly sure what that means, but the data did not transfer.

$review_text.: 2011-06-17: Yet another VIZIO Customer Service encounter




.this time FRUITLESS!I spent over 30 minutes with customer service and they refused to acknowledge that the following problem is with the TV
I have a new camera that shoots HD (1080P) video and audio


It has standard HDMI output


There are no settings on the camera to change the type of HDMI output, it is just HDMI industry standard
I connect a HDMI cable to the camera and attach to our VIZIO 22" TV or a friend's Samsung HDTV and the video and audio play perfectly


I attach the same camera, and the same cable, to this XVT373SV and the video plays fine, but no audio


I have tried all the HDMI inputs, even the one through which a Blu-ray was playing seconds before and the VIZIO plays no audio
I've cold booted the TV and they confirmed I have the last Firmware update installed.I called VIZIO Customer support, worked with them for over 30 minutes and they blamed the problem totally on the camera

They said that I needed to get into the camera settings and change the output to something different to get the 373 to play it

There are NO tweaks in the camera that can be changed to something different to accomodate the 373's technical problem
Yet, VIZIO insists the problem is the fault of the camera and that I need to contact the manufacturer and find out how to change, hack, or tweak it's output to meet the needs of the 373
Of course that might then make the camera incompatible with other fully compatible and capable displays, including VIZIO's own models."Alice in South Dakota, Badge 547" refused to escalate the incident and said there was nothing VIZIO could do to assist me
It will be interesting to see what the camera manufacturer has to say, consindering they are one of the two finest names in their field!My new "Motto" suggestion for VIZIO is "Not My Fault." I am updating the rating I gave them in several related areas after this latest encounter.I would certainly NEVER acquire this VIZIO model used or in the obsolete model market

I also would recommend avoiding VIZIO products having seen how much time it requires to get them to step up to their responsibilities
And then there are the times when they just walk away from addressing an issue.======Following is the earlier review, but yo may have already heard enough about VIZIO products=======NOTE: Numerous UPDATES regarding issues with this model have been moved to the end of this extensive owner experience review.Apologies that the review is long, but it is based on an informed evaluation
If you want something quick and dirty, look elsewhere


You'll find LOTs out there :-) I already know some people have benefited from what I share, especially those to whom this is a major investment and they want to make an informed choice

Of course this is history now, since the 373 seems to have come and gone now


However, I do see that some on the annoying problems of this unit are shared in a variety of VIZIO displays of varying sizes

Some of the areas of concern relative to features and vendor reliability will be of value in future purchases.I don't do comparison reviews or make recommendations since my reviews are in depth of products with which I have extensive experience


I'm NOT a review wonk


Finally, I ended up keeping this model because VIZIO finally provided a new replacement that didn't have the HDMI scrambling problem


No other brand 37" unit was available that would fit in the custom cabinetry

The picture is excellent even if the user interface is poorly designed and executed

My "star" ratings have been updated to reflect the final evaluation
Vendor Service for VIZIO rates two stars.=================I did not purchase this TV from Amazon but from another online retailer


This TV was top choice for me in a situation where I had to have a device that would fit inside an existing piece of furniture
In the size aspect, this TV rates a "10" for my needs

It fits in a cabinet with an 1/8th to spare on either side! The picture is very good and the overall look is clean
Thin was no big deal for me, but this one rates high in that area.I am writing this review to cover some of the aspects of the XVT373SV 37" RazorLED LCD HDTV (coming from the perspective of an ex-electronics tech and someone very familiar with electronics and user interface capabilities) to give others a balanced idea of overall quality and performance relative to your needs

I have seen a variety of commercial reviews (not comments here) that I think reprint boilerplate and are not based on actual use over time
In many ways this is a good TV, however at the typical price point it is hardly up to snuff when it comes to day to day use by people who read the manual and know the difference between a mediocre picture and one that is set-up properly.Over-the-air HDTV is very good with an appropriate antenna

However, changing channels is a very SLOOOOW process


Maybe that is true with all modern HDTVs with this feature set?The User Interface is horrible in multiple areas

This is very troubling as it is probably the easiest thing to do right since there are good interfaces out there and, theoretically, if can be fixed through a firmware upgrade
It has not been as of Version 3.nnn of the firmware

Next to actually watching something on the unit, the User Interface is where you will spend the largest amount of time

Expect to spend even more time in the VIZIO RazorLED interface unless VIZIO decides to fix numerous problems in the interface design
Here are a couple highlights, or lowlights:Our smaller two year old VIZIO can easily change the screen aspect ratio (Normal, Zoom, etc.) but with the XVT373SV you have to go into the menu system, highlight the option and then choose the correct display


And you are doing with a display reduced in size in some weird manner so until you exit the menu completely you are never certain if you have the correct setting or not
Really annoying, inferior design even compared to older and cheaper VIZIO products

Here is to hoping for a fix in a firmware update


It wasn't in the latest 3.0nnn version, but the startup on-screen logo has changed!Making picture adjustments is incredibly difficult for these times


It is amazing how deep VIZIO's crack software usability team has buried key settings regarding the picture
Those adjustments (color, frame rate, "motion enhancement" etc.) are buried several levels deeper in the user interface than the display aspect ratio settings.AMAZING: Having pressed the MENU button it requires 16 key presses to just get to the listing of items to adjust the picture! If the family wants to watch a movie you will learn to start the movie and do the setup ahead of time to avoid having a very early intermission.Note that this 120 Hz unit can display the "Soap Opera Effect" to a very high degree
(Google it if you don't know what it is.) You'll be watching a superb film but it looks like a much lower-budget, less artistic, video production


You will need to go on a journey through the Advance Picture settings and, from what I have been able to test, make sure the "Smooth Motion Effect" is turned off


I hope that someday more info will be available about "Real Cinema Mode" (see below) and Film Mode.Changing the INPUT is, thankfully, directly accessible from a button on the remote

Why not the display mode? Maybe even an assignable button or two is called for on this "Premium" remote?VIZIO has located Setup options access in two radically different places
One is through the remote's Menu button and another is found in the VIA Dock, the docking menu that appears when you hit the VIA logo button in the middle of the remote.Confession time, I am a manual reader

I want to get the most from any high technology device and I've also written technical documentation for end-users
Just where you need it most, the manual contains virtually "information-free" verbiage


I see the "Real Cinema Mode" option and want to know why I might use it or what it does or how to set it up

Here is what VIZIO shares in the manual: "The Real Cinema Mode option allows selection of the type of compensation used for the Smooth MotionTM Effect option


Choose from Off, Precision and Smooth." Gee, thanks for clearing that up! It is almost as though the writer could not find anyone who knew what the darn thing does
I printed an extra copy of the manual just to make reminder notes!Bugs???Shortly after getting the TV we added a new Sony Blu-ray


When the Blu-ray and the TV and turned on and I play a DVD or Blu-ray the TV displays a horrible scrambling of the video

This is in 1080P mode

The audio also cuts out in the worst of the scrambling


Thinking the issue was with the Blu-ray (after swapping out the Sony HMDI cable with a higher quality one and also trying different HMDI inputs) I exchanged for a different Sony of the same model but a couple months newer manufacture


To my surprise the problem continued
The VIZIO has NEVER exhibited this problem with any input other than the Sony Blu-ray

I'm left to believe it is a compatibility issue between this model Sony Blu-ray or one of the settings for output and something in the VIZIO


The strangest part is that the problem fades in 3 to 6 minutes and DOES NOT RETURN as long as everything is running
It may be some sort of heat related issue in the VIZIO circuitry.UPDATE: This turned out to be a unit defect, experienced by many others
Eventually VIZIO did swap out this defective unit for a new unit.Feature confusion:Although it is possible to dig deep enough (which I did before making the purchase) material on the VIZIO XVT373SV HDTV, including information on VIZIO's specific product website, is confusing in stating that this unit has smart dimming to enhance black levels


It DOES NOT have local dimming

Local dimming is not supported by the edge lit design in the smaller size units like my 37"


The larger models in this RazorLED series do appear to support actual local dimming to further enhance the black levels


On my unit we found the way VIZIO implemented dimming to be annoying and distracting
The only time it seemed to do much was in a full screen credit roll at the end of a Blu-ray movie


In parts where a major credit would leave the screen before the next one appeared the TV would have a little pause, then the backlight would virtually go off and a  second later as the next credit appeared the screen would suddenly flash to life making the black level very evident

Since this unit has respectable black levels we just turned that "feature" off


I have seen real local dimming in action and it is a unique way to achieve amazing dynamic range.The USB ports did NOTHING in the first release

One of the later software releases finally sees thumb drives with images and will do a rudimentary slide show

When you end the show it is necessary to unplug and replug the USB drive to see it seen again.The VIA applications (again as of firmware V 3.nnn) are incredibly lame in comparison to a Sony Blu-ray player we were given at Christmas

Having Netflix is nice, especially with the way media content is evolving


The Sony Blu-ray has almost as many CATEGORIES in Internet accessed content as VIA has in individual sources


I haven't counted this but I would estimate that the Sony Internet content interface has 20 to 40 TIMES as many content sources as VIA.Annoyances and quirks:Especially for one that is ballyhooed as a "Premium Remote," the design is only mediocre
The button locations and assignments continually evade me, but maybe that is an individual issue.One nice feature is that you can assign a remote to a specific input and the VIZIO remote will automatically be able to control some basic functions on your Blu-ray, DVD or even Xbox

Why they call this function Device Setup instead of Remote setup is another usability annoyance


Unfortunately, the functionality seems to have been very poorly thought out
I set the VIZIO remote up to control our disc player
When I switched the TV to the disc input it was no longer possible to access the menu of the TV! The MENU button on the VIZIO remote, needed to change almost anything in the screen, video or audio settings, instead made the DVD's Menu pop up for the disc in play! It was IMPOSSIBLE to access the VIZIO TV's menu to change screen aspect ratio or any of the needed settings for various discs! Oops VIZIO! Since the various settings are tied to the input mode, it was not possible to just go to another input, make the change, and return

It was necessary to switch to a different Input, then go to Device Setup for all the inputs and disable it for the disc player! This function is basically unusable

VIZIO does now have a workaround but it makes getting to the TV menu even more cumbersome.Inputs can have custom labels assigned


I do wish they could be longer than 10 characters

There is more than enough room on screen even though the "generic" title of the input continues to appear also.The Auto channel scan seems OK
I do wish I could have a setting there to choose to only include digital (or analog) channels

There is a partial channel search that allows this functionality, BUT it leaves in channels that we previously found and have changes

Being able to receive over-the-air HDTV from both Chicago and Milwaukee it means a lot of rescanning as new channels are always going on line and there has been a lot of shuffling
I'd like a feature to delete all channels and run a selective scan.The remote has a slide out QWERTY keyboard, but it too is mediocre
Most things you do with the keyboard will also require you to go back to the main remote so it really isn't all that convenient
I live by a Smartphone and the keyboard is far inferior, even though 2 to 3 times larger, than any Smartphone I've used


My current small BlackBerry keyboard is far superior to actually type something in.So, at the current version of the updated firmware I would have to say, keeping in mind the typical price point, that this TV is technically average, perhaps above average, but the User interface, access to functionality, and content of the documentation is sadly lacking or flawed
With some major changes, especially through the firmware, this TV could be "a contender."UPDATES CONCERNING UNIT DEFECTS:UPDATE 2011-01-26: A new wrinkle appeared today as VIZIO Technical support finally confirmed (after quite some time testing, re-birthing/resetting my TV to factory defaults and confirming it had the latest firmware) that the problem with Blu-ray distortion is a defect in this VIZIO TV


Three Blu-ray player exchanges later, multiple cable brand tests, and testing of all the HDMI inputs and disconnecting of all other devices



.it is a problem with a defective VIZIO TV
[A sequence of images showing the problem have been added to the webpage

Click on "View and share related images" below the picture of the VIZIO XVT373SV]Even though this new set is now confirmed defective by VIZIO the most VIZIO will do is "send out a repair person for in-home repair."I told the VIZIO customer service person that I would be much more comfortable with an exchange, even refurbished, than having a the repair person visit and work on repairing it

There was absolutely no willingness on the part of VIZIO to provide customer satisfaction when a lengthy problem turned out to be caused by their defective VIZIO product
That's not what I expected from a company that BRANDS themselves as, "America's Number One Hi-Def TV Company" and "The Home of Entertainment Freedom for All." Maybe that's the difference between "Branding" a company and "Building" a company? To me "Home Entertainment Freedom" now means that in the future be smarter to try a different vendor.I reduced this VIZIO's rating to 1 STAR based on VIZIO's support in correcting this issue.I told the VIZIO Agent I wanted to follow up with Sam's Club On-line before setting up a repair appointment

NO service tech, how qualified or trained, will have access to the resources available when a set is truly "refurbished" and tested at a vendor authorized facility.To me it was paying the "brand spanking new price" for a set but ending up with a repaired unit inferior to a refurbished one!I called Sam's On-line and their customer service didn't hesitate to begin an exchange for a new unit of the same model


I'm impressed that Sam's Club is covering for a failure of VIZIO to deliver Customer Satisfaction


I hope Sam's makes VIZIO pay for their dropping the ball!UPDATE 2011-02-12: A replacement XVT373SV arrived, provided by VIZIO

VIZIO decided than an exchange for a new unit was justified

BTW, I was still waiting for SAM's Online to follow through with their promise when VIZIO contacted me by phone.After a day of testing the replacement from VIZIO does not exhibit the HDMI signal distortion that the first TV does

If you want to see the annotated screenshots of the problem click on "View and share related images" below the picture of the VIZIO XVT373SV


I also plugged a thumbdrive with JPG images on it in one of the USB ports and after a while the TV reported it had found a content source connected to the USB port and presented a menu where I could play the content

The slide show worked fine
Last time I tried this the previous TV didn't ever respond to the insertion of a thumbdrive.

I could tell is was flimsy wiring because when you would jiggle the cable, the picture would alternate from displaying to not displaying until one day it just stopped displaying at all. I keep my electronics stored safely and avoid extreme heat, cold, shocks etc, so I know that it was not me being careless. I guess I really got what I paid for.Perfect price, awesome product. I can now extend the display of my macbook pro to my samsung monitor, as well as using the HDMI to DVI adaptor I happened to have and can watch netflix on my TV through the laptop.

The case is of good construction, has all the holes where they are supposed to be, the magnetic clasp isn't too strong or too weak, and the ability to stand up the Tab on it's own is very nice.  I didn't have high expectations, but all of the expectations I had were met, and I consider this to be a very good value, even if the order consisted of nothing else besides the case.  The screen protector and cables were a very nice bonus, IMO.  While the screen protector wasn't the absolute best I've ever seen or used, it is still more than adequate and wasn't hard to attach.  All of the additional cables seemed to work fine.  Overall, a very good value.

$REVIEW.: My previous GPS was a Magellan Roadmate 2000 which is quite a few years old. When it started routing me through parking lots for the shortest route, I knew it was time to replace it.I shopped around for months before going with this particular GPS. So many bad reviews have scared me from many other models. The Megellan line is a solid performer but seemed limited, even restricted. I was ready for something new. This one fits the bill.The first thing you notice is the physical aspects: it's small even though the screen is a good size. The mount is compact. Much smaller that the Magellan. I can put the entire GPS and all associated equipment in a small camera bag. Very nice. There is a metal frame around the GPS unit itself. It is loosely mounted and I can see it falling off if it were ever dropped. The power cord is plenty long if you need to mount it far from the outlet. The mount works very well even though it is small. I had cleaned the windshield recently with a special cleaner making it very slick and the Magellan mount had a hard time holding on but the Garmin stuck right to it. The power plugs into the rear instead of the side which seems odd. The only thing is you just have to plug in the power before mounting the GPS to the holder. The screen is the right size. Not too small, not too big.On-line:This unit, like other Garmin GPS', have additional things on-line that you can download for your unit. I really like this because it will allow you to keep your unit 'fresh.' You can download different vehicles to represent your car on the map. And you can add other voices if you get tired of the included ones. The ones on-line are all incredibly annoying, but you still have a choice. You can even download a program to use your own voice, free of charge. There are even games for your GPS if you want. All very nice options, even if I'm not planning on using them. Of course being able to update the map 4 times a year is super.Actual use:I found it odd with the way the program is laid out for adding destinations. If you have more than one to enter, you have to back out and go through the menus again. Considering that I only added multiple locations for my initial setup and don't expect I'll be doing that again, it's not a big deal.It takes some time for the unit to first lock onto the satellites. Calculating routes actually takes longer than my old Magellan. It gives you a countdown as it is working out the route. The screen scrolls smoothly as you move through the map. The screen gives you plenty of information including your current speed and it updates quickly. If you wander off the route, it tells you that it's recalculating and doesn't blank the screen like the Magellan did. Re-routing is quick. The one feature that I really like is the voice. It does a good job of pronouncing street names. It speaks quickly and naturally most of the time. And it's informative, not stingy with the speaking. The speech does get a tad choppy but not distracting. I would like to see it give me directions a bit sooner when reaching a turn. It waits until I am just about at the turn, which is not good when you're on the highway. ETA estimates need some work. You have an on-screen ETA (which I really like) but it seems to think that I must be a speed demon and never stop at traffic lights. Even when driving 5-10 MPH over the limit for a long trip, the ETA estimated that I would have arrived 10 minutes earlier for my 100 minute trip. But the return trip was accurate and I was driving closer to the speed limit. Go figure.The route calculated gives somewhat different results from the Magellan. It did a good job of giving me routes that avoided slow areas and traffic lights. The old Magellan would always come up with a return route that differed from the route to the destination. The Garmin doesn't do that. I've noticed that side street names will sometimes flip around and flail around the screen if you are on a winding road or the side street is at an odd angle. It can be distracting. It shows my own house at the opposite end of the street, so there are some inaccuracies in the map as well.Overall:I really like this GPS. It has a few things about it that come off as quirky, but it works well and I enjoy using it. There's nothing so bad about it that makes this unit difficult or even unusable. and it is user friendly. You have to invest a little time to get to know how it's organized if you've not had a Garmin before. I consider this a good buy and the price isn't bad for what you're getting. I expect I'll be enjoying this one for many years to come.

$review_text.: I haven't used OTA broadcast television in a long time


I'm a TV addict and have had cable or satellite TV for as long as I can remember

I wanted to put a TV in the guest room though, and this one was just going to pick up OTA


I wasn't going to pay for another tuner box for a room we just don't use.I hadn't seen any OTA HD yet, but I had heard that it was better than I'm getting with DirecTV, plus I was excited to hear that my neighbors were picking up 15 channels.I live about 30 miles from the main towers
the ABC channel here is in the Hi-VHF band


the rest are UHF

The TV is on the 2nd floor, there is just plastic siding on the house, and I'm not down in a valley, so I had high hopes that I could get away with an indoor antenna


But no matter where I placed this antenna, I had to move it around to get one channel in, then another would go spotty - and it wouldn't even touch the ABC signal (VHF) at all.Out of curiosity I slapped a $5 set of rabbit ears with a UHF loop - you've seen this antenna before, straight out of 1957 - and now I get the VHF station perfectly, and the UHF stations are about the same as with this RCA amplified shingle

I ended up finding instructions on Youtube on making your own antenna out of coat hangers and a piece of wood

If you need VHF too, look for the improved version with 10" whiskers

My $10 DIY construction project kicks this antenna's butt.I took it apart to see what's inside

Maybe a dollar's worth of circuit board


It isn't even a fractal design


Save your money!

I absolutely love that the entire back can be attached to velcro so you can position your Kindle in any direction you want


It also props it up and has two small bumps to choose from as to how tall you want the Kindle to be positioned


This is absolutely worth $15! I highly recommend.

$REVIEW.: I just replaced a 10 year old  Onkyo 600 with this 626.  I didn't even have to reprogram my universal remote -- the codes were the same.Pros:-  Set up is very easy and comprehensive.  They provide a microphone on a long wire.  You place the microphone at your favorite listening positions, and the system self-calibrates and adjusts output levels.  Pretty impressive.- Sound is excellent, as I expect from Onkyo.- TV picture quality through the switched HDMI ports is excellent.- The OSD (On Screen Display) is much improved from my old amp.  All setup, calibration and adjustments can be made from the TV screen.- HDMI switching between 6 input ports works well, though with a delay.- The receiver came the next day after I ordered it!Cons:- My biggest complaint is that I cannot connect my wireless headphones when the system has only digital (i.e. HDMI) input.  My wife sometimes likes to listen in from the kitchen when I watch a movie, but if I plug into the headphone jack on the front, the speakers get cut off.  The only work around is to connect both HDMI and analog sound cables, and connect headphones to the Zone 2 output.  This adds unnecessary complexity to the setup.- HDMI switching takes several seconds, during which the screen goes blank.

$REVIEW.: This unit reminds me of a class project in Electronics Lab 101. It's as if they just threw together some off the shelf parts to see if they could get an HD radio to work. It's definitely not a polished product ready for production. It has a standard tuner and data decoder module mounted on a small PC board with a large power transformer and 3 terminal regulator on a heatsink. Who still uses a large power transformer these days? All the components get so hot they will burn you but there shouldn't be any high power components producing a lot of heat on a radio, radio circuits are normally low power. The unit has a lot of other drawbacks besides overheating, the display won't turn off at night, it doesn't remember favorite channel settings more than a few minutes when power is lost and the time goes back to flashing 12:00 like an old VCR.The software programming has a lot of problems. You can't enter the frequency for a radio station from the front panel or the remote, all you can do is step up or down through all the frequencies one at a time so it takes a long time to get up and down the dial. It has a search function for HD stations but doesn't remember them.Once stations are programmed as favorites they can be accessed by the number pad on the remote but if power goes off those are lost.There are no RF amplifiers, the antenna inputs go right to the tuner module. Reception was about average on FM but AM was totally useless with the supplied wire loop antenna and wouldn't pick up anything indoors besides hum and noise. It needs to have a shielded type F connector for AM in order to connect an outside antenna to get decent reception like it has for FM. I removed the two terminal connector from the PC board and installed an F connector, then with an outside antenna the AM reception was only fair. It still won't match a good car radio for reception but with an 8' CB whip installed on the roof I could get all the HD radio stations from Phoenix about 30 miles away in the daytime. The signal strength has to peg the little bar graph display in order to get HD so when the AM stations cut power at night none of them will come in with HD except the Disney channel. Another station would try to come in at night but HD cut in and out all the time which was very annoying. There is no way to stop it from trying to play in HD all the time as there is with the Sangean HDT-1X. The Sangean has an RF amplifier at the AM input so the reception is slightly better but the weaker AM stations still won't come in with HD at night on the Sangean either, except for Disney. If you want a decent HD radio get the Sangean HDT-1X. It's more expensive but not nearly as annoying and doesn't overheat.

Both were new and neither drive would format correctly. Windows 8.1 would format them once and then - poof - no more access to the drives as storage units or as primary partitions. I had to boot into Linux and format them internally while hooked up to SATA connections. Now before you go and blame microsuds 8-1, and I would love to by the way, know that I mentioned other types of drives that were formatted with the same OS in the same way without issues. The Kingston drives are the only drives I have had problems with while using this dock and win-doze 8-1.

$REVIEW.: They work okay... but compared to my two Viewsonic PGD-150 DLP-link glasses, they don't work as well.Here's the problem... both my wife and I were watching "A Christmas Carol" in 3D and kept noticing some darkness or shadows around the edges of our vision.  When using the Viewsonics, it looked fine.Digging a little further, I could tell that with these 3DTV glasses, the parts of the picture that should be black were a darkish gray instead, but the Viewsonics showed them black, as intended (like the letterboxing top/bottom bars of the screen).When you first turn on these 3DTV glasses, the shutters for both eyes block out for a second or so, and you can tell that they don't entirely block the image... I could still see a shadow of the screen coming through.So my theory is that since they don't entirely block light, some of the image for the "wrong eye" is coming through, and even including the light-bursts that DLP uses to sync the glasses (that's what makes the screen look a bit gray if you view without the glasses, or like someone cranked up the brightness).It results in the 3D effect being a little muddied for me... I couldn't place my finger on it, but it was almost like the L-R was out of sync (it wasn't), but not entirely.I mention the movie we were watching because if you've seen it, you know it has a lot of darker scenes, and the light bleed-thru seemed more prominent when it's supposed to be dark.  During daylight or brightly lit scenes, it was actually not too bad, besides feeling a little cross-eyed sometimes.And yes, we made sure the L-R polarity was correct... our Mitsubishi 82738 is set to reversed, but just in case, we toggled the polarity on the glasses and it didn't help.  And as mentioned, the Viewsonic PGD-150 glasses we also have were doing just fine... they're also set to use reverse-polarity by default (I think that's normal for DLP link... IR link uses standard polarity, but don't quote me on that).These were comfortable though.  That's the one problem with those Viewsonics... they hug my face so tight, by the end of the movie I nearly have a migraine.  And the earpieces have already broken on both sets, so they're held together with friction tape.  Great.I don't know if I could solve this by maybe turning down the overall brightness of the TV... we turned off every other light source in the room so it was pitch-black, and that also helped, but with the Viewsonics, I could watch during the day without any problems, and those things just did not let extra light bleed through when the shutter was closed, so... I don't know.I guess I'll hang onto these as "just in case guests are over" glasses, although I'll let them use the Viewsonics and we'll use these.  I don't want guests to come away from our home theater with a negative view of 3D tv just because these glasses don't do a good job.For those looking for a decent set of DLP link, I don't know what to tell you... other reviews say these are way better than Optoma's, so those must REALLY be bad.  For myself, I'm looking at just getting an IR transmitter and using the Xpand YOUniversal (or whatever they're called).  Too bad they didn't make those able to handle DLP, and I'm not crazy about their older DLP models with custom battery compartments or whatever... more for commercial use, where making the batteries hard to change is actually a good thing.EDIT: I just went to the Xpand website and they have a newer DLP model out, the "Edux 3"... using easily replaced, common 2032 batteries apparently.

$review_text.: I bought the HP Pavilion dv-7 because I wanted a larger screened laptop. It's an increase over our HP 15 inch laptop, but I had imagined there would be a bigger difference. Another misconception I'd had is that this model had a backlit keyboard. It doesn't .  The Beats audio played through the laptop's speakers is good, but far from spectacular. With some adjustment fiddling, the sound is acutally pretty good played through my external Logitech speakers. Enough whining already.The Display - Color is vivid and as good as on any monitor I've ever owned. As I type this review using the 60 day trial of Microsoft Word, the text is crisp, dark, and very legible. Photos look superb on this display as do graphics brought up online. Graphics are especially good using the 64 bit explorer but web videos won't play on this format.  I won't pretend to be a gamer, but the few arcade style games I've played on this laptop look terrific.To try out the display, I downloaded a movie from Amazon. The download only took a couple hours and the movie (The Dark Knight) looked great on the screen. There is a key to adjust the brightness of the display, but so far I haven't had a need to use it.Keyboard - I like the feel of the keyboard, though the keys are not as concave as on my other HP laptop.  The keys are not as slick and shiny as those on the Toshiba laptops I've seen and there is more separation between the keys.The touchpad is not overly sensitive and works fine, but I prefer using a mouse and keep a Logitech M305 attached.Aesthetics - This is a great looking laptop with an elegant looking silver finish. On the back of the lid is an HP logo that stays lit when the laptop is on. The keys do show fingerprints and the user is advised to type on these with clean fingers. I've noticed that this unit is also a dust magnet, more so than any laptop I've ever used. Best keep a can of compressed air nearby.Windows 7- My technical savvy is average at best, but even I have had no problems adjusting to Windows 7. It's easy to learn and seems much more stable than Vista. On the hard drive are videos and help screens for Windows 7 that many users will find helpful, especially initially.Help guides - Just about all the laptop information is on the hard drive. To get you started there is a start up poster and a rudimentary owner's guide.  One of the odd warnings found in the pamphlet sized guide warns the user that the computer can get hot and he or she should not rest the laptop in his or her lap. Funny stuff.Battery life - For me it's great. I never use the laptop unplugged for more than two or three hours, more than enough time to watch a movie. The battery is quite large and snaps onto the bottom of the laptop externally. Its bulk raises up the back of the laptop which  actually makes for an ideal typing position.Adding peripherals is easy with this laptop. I have a printer upstairs which the laptop found quickly after I had loaded the Canon drivers on the laptop. If I can make a wireless connection, anybody can.Fingerprint reader - I figured this was a useless gadget that I'd seldom if ever use. I've actually grown to like it quite a bit. Once the fingerprint reader is set up, you just brush a finger over the reader instead of typing in a password. Like a kid, I get a kick out of it every time.HP Quickweb is something I haven't used often. When the computer is turned on a Quickweb screen appears that allows the user to access photos, music , or even the web without the need to start Windows.  It really doesn't take that long for Windows to kick in, so I seldom use the Quickweb feature.Despite a few minor complaints, I have no regrets purchasing this laptop and would do it again.Final Word - Set up of the Hp dv-7 out of the box was child's play. I downloaded and installed some updates and set up a simple password. Then the computer restarted itself for all the updates to take effect. When the computer came back on it wouldn't recognize my password.  What a nightmare. Finally after trying everything I could think of and researching the problem on another computer, I opened in safe mode and was able to start all over again, erasing all that I had done previously. From my Googling I learned that mine was not an isolated problem with Windows 7. The good news is that I've had no problems since.UPDATE - In the past week I've discovered the web cam and updated Windows 7 which added more features to the photo program. The webcam effects have to be seen to be believed. I'm having a lot of fun making videos of myself and sending them to the unsuspecting. The avatars are especially filled with possibilities for the imaginative. Now a whole new world has opened to me.NoTE - In early 2014 the  motherboard went up on this laptop and I had to buy a new laptop. It was good while it lasted.

$REVIEW.: This battery is the worst. It is made in Hong Kong, take it from my experience and those of other reviews that frequently there are defective cells. I followed the instructions and did the charge/discharge crap which reminded me of old laptop batteries. Eventually this did increase the battery life to what I was hoping for. Well my hope did not last long.Maybe a week, if that, is what the battery was good for. It did not take long for my laptop to just not turn on with the battery in unless I had it pluged in. Now sometimes the battery says 50%, sometimes it is in the 30's... it never shows anything above 50 (rarely even gets to 50). Whenever I turn the laptop off then back on I see a different percent of battery.The only reason I might use the battery now is to elevate my laptop while it is plugged in. If I want to move my laptop I replace the battery before I unplug it. I'm looking for a manufacturer other than Dekcell that has a similar 12-cell battery. If it is going to take 8-15 days to ship then I'm not buying it b/c it may be the same manufacturer.

$REVIEW.: These very comfortable headphones sound quite nice. I used them in an office environment for about three months. I read other reviews which suggested that the cord was fragile, so I was careful with it. Despite its pampered life alternating between my head and a little hook at the top of my cubicle wall, my cord developed a short or gap inside.One minor nuisance is that these have very low impedance, which makes them much louder than other headphones. My PC sound output was often within two or three "notches" of the minimum, which made minor volume adjustments impossible. (If you're set on these, consider an inline volume control such asSennheiser HZR-62. You can use it with other headphones, forever, and it will not have the left-right imbalance at low volumes that a cheaper one-dial volume control would have.)While these headphones lasted, they were nearly perfect; they do shield against outside sounds, but not enough to prevent you from hearing things if you stop the music. They are not so big as to invite comment, and they're not fatiguing nor do they fall off of the head.But the cable doesn't last for very long, even with very careful use. I'm going to try another JVC next, theHARX700 Precision, which should be a lot sturdier, and still comfortable.

What kind of quality do you expect? Obviously not high end but it does it's job.UV FILTER - Obviously it's not the same as any high end UV filters but it works fine

If it's for protection then it's good enough


If you want it for protection and still want good image quality and no flares.

etc.
then I suggest actually getting a higher quality UV filter (like HOYA HMC)


Different quality UV filters can and will change your overall image quality

At first.

I used this for protection and then I noticed the changes in image quality vs


no UV filter mounted


(So I purchased a higher quality UV filter after researching a lot.
HOYA SHMC UV 0)


If you don't really care for minor image quality then just get this cheap one.CPL - I am in LOVE with this one
I take a lot of landscape and sky photos so this is a good one in my mind

The quality is good enough and I'm not sure how it compares to the high end one but of course there will be a difference

I use this all the time.FL - I rarely use this one but it does the job


You might have to play with a few settings in your camera.For this price, they're all excellent!

In fact, I have to be careful to give my HP Photosmart M415 enough time between shots or it will take bad photos that cause iPhoto to lock up on my mac (just downloads the bad photo in Windows - no locking up).  Where this card shines on my camera is scrolling between photos in the viewer and downloading photos.  Much faster than a regular SD card of the same size.

$review_text.: I bought this to go into my separate carport.  I spent HOURS trying to get this to work.  I called their support line, but after ten minutes and two pick-ups only to put me immediately back on hold, I gave up.  I first tried to connect to the camera wirelessly.  That did not work so I plugged it into the modem.  That connected it, but it never focused.  It was just a blurry mess.  Believe me, I tried everything in my arsenal to get this thing to work.  Future attempts to connect it wirelessly also failed so I finally packed up the whole she-bang and sent it right back.  I will update my post if I find a surveillance camera that works.3/30/14- Bought a Foscam Fi8908w as soon as my return for this one was processed.

$REVIEW.: The actual product is quite good.  However, mine arrived bent 5-7 degrees thanks to the carrier.  They wrapped the dented part up with tape.  Anyways, Amazon was nice enough to refund me the cost of this so I'm happy with the service.  I was able to use a section of the paper that wasn't damaged and the results looked good.  But due to the damage, it's hard to roll up and down so I just use it to cover the floors when I need to paint something.  It does a good job of preventing paint dripping from getting onto the floors!!

$REVIEW.: The 905 is a great webacam, with auto focus,clear and sharp picture, and a nice quality of construction...really everything you could expect of a higher end, 720p webcam. The only real problem, and I didn't rate it lower because of it, is that the built in mic "pops" alot while using it, making it pretty useless. As I have never had a webcam that actually had a good mic built in, from any manufacturer, I'm not going to hold it against an otherwise sterling performance. If your serious about recording, you should invest in a decent mic to go along with your great webcam, it's just common sense ;-)All told, if you want a great cam, at a great price, with all the bells and whistles, this is a great choice. Highly recommended!!

$REVIEW.: I have used Case Logic products for years, and while familiar with Thule, I have never owned one of their products before. This case for the iPad Mini is constructed in a simple, sturdy and quality way, and so exemplifies the Thule concept of good items made for the outdoors traveler and user.The outer portion of this case has a 'tacky' like grip, that makes it easy to handle and is water resistant. The magnetic closure will keep your iPad mini securely closed as well. The actual tablet grips are made of hard plastic, and I think will stand the test of regular use. There is no stitching on this product, meaning it should hold together over the long haul.While I do wish the side edge had been closed all the way around, and not just on one side, that is my only real wish for a change here. Well, that and the over sized Thule logo on the front upper corner. Otherwise, this is a quality item from Case Logic that brings Thule's stylish ruggedness.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this as my only computer for about a week.  I went from using an older Macbook and desktop computer to this because I am going to be taking a job traveling and wanted something simple, quick and light for web browsing, watching netflix, and word processing.  It does all of those things well, I can plug in my external hard drive and watch movies and listen to music for when I don't have internet connectivity.  I'm not a big fan of laptop mousepad so I purchased a usb wireless mouse and it works great.  My only beef is that chromebook cannot play local .wmv files apparently because that kind of file is proprietary to windows.  So in order to watch a .wmv movie you have to upload it to the cloud where it will be converted to a supported format.Pros:  Starts up super quick, no waiting, no load times.Slick and pretty, reminds me of a macbook in its appearance.Feels very light.Nice camera for video calls.Cons:  Can't play local .wmv files.Can't play local android/windows games.That's really about it.  For the most part I knew what this machine could and could not do before I bought it and for the purposes of web browsing and watching movies/netflix/amazon prime, it is a slick, quick reasonably priced notebook.

$REVIEW.: I figured I'd give this a shot on a laptop that was using some ridiculous thermal cooling pads that didn't work at all. Sad to say that this has extremely poor performance. Like the other reviewer stated this does not transfer heat very well. It's very easy to manipulate because it is silicone, but that's probably what makes it have such poor heat transfer. It's not sticky but it will stick to a heat-sink or heat spreader after applied. There is really no point in using this for a CPU or GPU because it is completely inadequate. Just get some thermal paste and you'll be much better off.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Image Quality even on FX camerasCurved diaphragm bladesCons:Distortion (worse than 1.8D)Bottom Line:This is a great value lens with a nice step up in image quality across the range vs the 50mm f/1.8D, and the SWM focus is a bonus for those that have bodies that won't work with screw drive.I have run full lens reviews of the following lenses, including formal resolution tests using specialized software to measure the results.Compared to the 50mm f/1.8D:The new G version is sharper across the frame at all apertures and settings
 A noticeable amount, although it will be most noticeable at large apertures and in the corners


 The new version also has 7 curved (instead of straight) aperture blades so the out of focus highlights will be nicer on the G lens

 The downside is distortion is much worse (about 4x) on the 50mm f/1.8G, measuring a noticeable 1.3% vs 0.3% barrel for the D.Compared to the 50mm f/1.4G:The 50mm f/1.8G performs similarly optically, maybe slightly better in the center, slightly worse in the corners, but similar overall, so image quality difference is a wash


 The 50mm f/1.4G is targeted more towards professionals with better manual focus feel and also twice as long of a focus throw so focus might be more precise on the 1.4G, but slightly slower too

 The 1.4G has 9 curved aperture blades instead of 7, and the distortion is slightly worse on the 1.4G

 The 50mm f/1.4G also has half an f/stop advantage.This lens displaces the 50mm f/1.8D most, the buyers of the 50mm f/1.4G will likely still buy that lens, but this is a huge step up in image quality from the 50mm f/1.8D, and is half as much as the 1.4G to boot


 It will be a huge seller like the 35mm f/1.8.Eric

$review_text.: This is a great little camera at this price point
I don't understand all the negative comments about it

The picture quality in 2D is as to be expected with a low end, point and shoot and the 3D photos are awesome


I bought the W3 for a 3D project I'm working on and so far it is has created high quality 3D images
(The quality of a 3D image is not to be compared to the quality of a 2D image.)This camera isn't going to replace any other camera you may own, use it as a 3D creation tool and you'll be fine
If you are expecting high end DSLR quality photos you need to look elsewhere.I would have given the W3 5 stars if it wasn't for three minor issues I have with it.1) Battery Life - Buy at least 1 extra battery if you are going to be away from your charger.2) No remote option - I wish it had the option to use a remote with it

I'm using the W3 on a tripod and for maximum stability and picture quality I'd like to use a remote for this project.3) Doesn't save pictures as a .jpeg - The W3 saves its picture files as .mpo files
It is easy to convert the .mpo file into two .jpeg files, a left and right image


But it is just more to add to my work load.

$REVIEW.: If you have an older vehicle without bluetooth, and a spare cup-holder this might work for you. Charges alright by USB (car-charger included.) Pairs easily. There is also an AUX connection but you will have to buy your own cord. Passable as a speaker-phone. If you're hoping to play your tunes don't expect to rattle any windows. Not very much volume.If this is what you really want, no major problems with it. To be honest about it, I just think you could find a better solution at a better price.

$review_text.: I filled the backpack with a camera body, 4 lenses, and a flash

 There was still room for a small lens.Pros:Comfortable, good layout, a lot of versatility.Cons:On the first day of carrying it the seam started to pull out at the top of the straps then later at the top of the second pocket

 This was on the first day of a 10 day vacation so I had to be extra careful the rest of the trip to make sure it would not come completely undone.

$review_text.: The set up was a breeze and so far no problems.  I say so far because I intend to use this in a new desk which hasn't arrived yet.  The CPU will be hidden away and I'm wondering if I will have to have the sensor out on the desk top or not.  I hope not but if so, it's small and the cord that plugs it into the USB port is a decent length so it wouldn't be a big issue. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  Worth every penny.

$REVIEW.: The first thing I want to say is that the difference in quality you get out of this cam is very evident depending on what IM program you use.  I used Yahoo for a while with family and we were all about ready to toss the thing in the garbage.  However, since Logitech recommends MSN messenger we thought we'd give it a shot.  Huge difference.  The images were more clear, the sound was better and there were fewer "freezes".However, it was still hardly outstanding and you must be prepared to spend quite a bit of time with your family and friends tweaking the distance of the cam from their face, the sound levels, the volume on their speakers, etc.  And if they change any of that the next time you videoconference you'll need to start over.  This thing is NOT plug and play for most people.Face tracking is utterly useless.  I don't know what miracle people are using to get it to work but for me all it does is make the cam jump all over the place.  If you're impossibly frustrated with it try switching to MSN Messenger, go through the sound setup, see if that does the trick, if not then move the cam closer to your face and then turn down the volume on your speakers.

$review_text.: As others have said don't read the specs and think you're going to stuff a big bank of hard drives in here.  I set up a HTPC with an ATX board, full size video card, SSD main drive and second 1TB drive.  I can add a couple more drives but with a basic setup it's tight in there.  It's just the way it is for horizontal chassis's.  But the look is fantastic.  You can cover lights and the front is plain which is what I wanted.  Looks great in a rack with other AV gear.  I had to Dremmel down a corner of one of the fans to have access to mobo SATA ports.  I could have removed the fan but it's a main one for HDD cooling.  If you're a bit of a tinkerer you'll be ok but you won't be able to max it out.  5 stars on looks, 3 on fit, 4 average.

$review_text.: I just made the jump from crop sensor (APSC) camera to a full frame.  I wanted a 1.4X teleconverter to recover some of the loss of effective lens length that comes from making that jump.Since the two lenses I wanted to use with this TC the most are Sigma lenses (the 70-200 f2.8 EX DG OS HSM and the 150-500 f5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM), I first purchased the Sigma 1.4X EX APO DG teleconverter.  I had that TC for two days, and found the loss of sharpness to be unacceptable.  Since I'd bought that from Amazon, I was able to return it.On one of my flickr groups, I came across a few stunning images taken with the same 150-500 lens as I have, and this Kenko 1.4x TX.  I decided to give it a try, and so I bought it (again, from Amazon).So far, I've taken about 400 pictures with this TC, using not only my two Sigma lenses, but also my Canon 70-300 f4-5.6L.  And a couple hundred more using my wife's 60D.  So far, I'm very impressed at how well it works.  I'm sure that there probably IS some loss of IQ, but it's very small.  Much much less than the Sigma TC, and certainly not enough to tell until you start looking at 100% crops.  I got a picture of one of my beagles with my big Sigma lens and this TC, and it's probably the sharpest picture I've taken to date with that lens.  And while the Sigma TC didn't work on the Canon 70-300L lens, this Kenko didn't have any problems at all.Autofocus works OK with this TC, both on my 5Kmkiii and on my wife's 60D.  It does focus a little slower than without the TC, and sometimes it hunts a bit in low light...but you knew that going in!  My camera correctly adds an f-stop, and correctly reports the total effective FL (lens length X 1.4) in the exif data.Bottom line, I'm happy with this purchase. If I lost this TC, I'd buy another one.

The case is attached to my backpack so it bumps into things on a regular basis but my headphones are still in flawless condition and work perfectly.Only complaint that i have which is stopping this from being a 5-star item is the clip/lanyard that attach the case. It is a little longer than i would like to be, which makes the case swing back and forth more than i would like. Wish the length was adjustable or just shorter.

 I really haven't been watching much TV - the only shows that interest me have been more easily watched in higher resolution on a computer (laptop) monitor, but this changes things.Out of the box, the high definition channels look just phenomenal


 I saw "Cars" in HD and it blew away the lowly DVD my daughter has

 The Red Sox look terrific

 Unfortunately at the time I needed a spare charger, it was on indeterminate multi-week backorder.At that time, I went with theiGo Universal Wall (AC) and Auto (DC) Chargerwith iGo'sKindle Power Tip

 That is working well.The (cheaper)iGo Universal Wall (AC) Chargerwill also work with the same Kindle Power Tip.Both of these are larger and less elegant than Amazon's Kindle charger
 Now that the Amazon charger is available for immediate ship, these alternatives probably make less sense for normal use
 However if you have multiple devices and only want to carry a single charger, the iGo chargers could still be useful.

$review_text.: I have numerous camera tripods already, but this is the one I will use for casual outings

 I have a carbon fiber tripod that is lighter and even more sturdy, but it cost well in excess of a hundred dollars

This tripod comes very close to matching the carbon fiber unit

I knocked off one star because of the effort to crank the extension rod on which the camera mounts


Maybe there is a defect with the one I have, but it requires so much force that I worry about the handle breaking someday
And when I crank it to the down position, it almost falls down on its own


I know there is a tightening nut to secure the height, but it is definitely loose or disengaged

It is only the upward cranking force that is an issue

I may consider adding some lubricant to the gear, but I am hesitant to do that just yet
I read the other reviews and nobody mentioned this issue, so maybe it is just this unit I have that is problematic.Otherwise, this is a very good tripod


It has two bubble levels, one of which is a circular bubble to adjust the extension legs

The other is a conventional level built into the camera mounting base


It checks the level in the vertical tilt direction and when combined with the circular bubble level, you should get a level photo every time if you take the time
But the camera base level is not so convenient to see.The tripod camera mount has a quick release base so you can pop the camera on or off the tripod quickly

 All three feet have pivots to adapt to the surface of the floor or ground

There are lock nuts for every possible setting, so nothing is going to slip if you take the time to engage them


 There is a hook on other center shaft to add a weight for further stability if you are inclined to carry a weight around with you


I'm not one of those people
 And there is a carry handle that I've never seen on a tripod
The legs are made of tubular aluminum for light weight, but still very sturdy construction
Overall, I think this tripod will pass the long term endurance test in the field
I have several other cheap tripods that all broke, usually some plastic piece and especially the crank handles
There are plastic pieces on this tripod just like any other tripod, but they appear to be fairly strong, especially compared to the cheap tripods


Anyway, I am about to take a trip to China and the Philippines, so I'll find out soon how it works in a real life situation.

$REVIEW.: Got this over the xmas period and installed it fairly easily. Cleared a large area and dusted the table and laid down a magazine to use to hang over the table edge, this allowed me to better fiddle with the install.  Used a hair dryer to speed up the drying as well.  Install took 30 minutes. The mic(s) holes are too small in my opinion.  I ended up razor blade cutting a little off 2 edges as to make sure the mic holes were not covered.  --&#62; minor difficulty to be honest.  In the 3 months that it was on, not even the cut pieces I personally cut ever peeled PERIOD.  I am impressed.  Its thick-enough and has handled everyday sliding and bookbag in/outs etc.I broke my Air and in the process of getting it replaced, I needed to remove the back skin (did not install the front display skin) it literally took 2 sets of hands slowly peeling back the skin to remove.  I am still impressed, it didn't leave any residue.  Emailed Skinomi and they got back to me within 24 hours (Vanessa), went through the straight forward warranty claim, and by the time I had asked for a tracking number, it was out for delivery already.  --&#62; works for me!On the Air the skin comes to the edge, but not over it (aluminium backing) so if it were to drop just so, a plastic, TPU, or wood or other rear case that wraps up & over the coner edges would potentially protect a little bit more....however, I have gone through 4 rear cases for ipad2&3 and all ending up cracking / ruining the plastic cases AND denting the rounded corner(s) so to me this urethane stuff works just as well.  Add a Apple Smartcover and that how I'm rolling :)

The inside is a beautiful deeper pink color that feels divine. The case is very easy to slip the kindle into and it has a kind of grip area on the bottom that keeps my Fire held firmly. It is easy to grab, carry, and handle - no slipping. This is my first sleeve for a Kindle and I find, for the Fire, it is exactly perfect. While I enjoy the amazon case for working out where I am putting this on the elliptical shelf the sleeve works loads better. It seems to protect well, does not attract dust overmuch, and in general is a real pleasure to have. Bravo!

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this thing. Even though I can make recordings on my point and shoot digital camera, it drains battery quickly and I find myself reaching for my Flip Mino instead. The battery seems to stay charged forever, and it is so easy to use I can hand it off to grandma or any "non-gadety" person and just say "press the red button to record." Really, it's that simple!There are few buttons on the actual device and they are intuitive: a big red button for record, a plus/minus button, left/right arrow, a trash icon, and the standard triangular play button. The device has an internal rechargeable battery that holds a charge; I keep this in my purse for soccer games and such and I can go a week or two between charging and it's ready to go. There's a clever flip-out usb built in so no need to worry about toting around/having a cord handy for charging or downloading videos. The video quality is actually better than a bigger standard camcorder we have, which really impressed me because the Mino is so small I figured something would have to be a trade off for that (happy to say that I've yet to find the downside).I really love the ease of use. This would be a great gift for someone who is frustrated with technology: they can take videos all day long without needing a giant user manual to do so...you just may need to help them with the post processing, but that pretty much goes for any computer related media.

$REVIEW.: I'm sure that it runs well when not defective, but 1 of the modules was defective. I understand these things happen, but their customer support was horrible.My email seemed to be thrown around to different agents. Each agent also seem to not even read the history with the previous rep. I didn't realize this until about the third email that the signature was different each time. I believe one of the last emails was from one of the original reps. None of them seem to be proactive, nor were they in any way trying to help me out. I felt like I was just reading the back of a cereal box. Just information that I can read on their website. I had to email them several times just to get information out of them.I decided not to take the risk and get another defective part. They wanted to test it to ensure that it was defective. I understand that, but to get a simple, yes this is the right product for your machine, these are the steps you need to take (basic information I do not know about), took several days to find out. I wasn't willing to waste more time with their ill-trained employees. Thankfully the seller that I got it from (a 3rd party thankfully not them), no questions ask gave me a refund.I ended up buying another set that was actually $20 cheaper. Runs fine with no problems.My advice is if you do buy this from Crucial&#8230;do a full memory test before anything else. If you have to contact them. Write everything on the product and your computer. Tell them in explicit details (as you would to a 2 year old) that you want it exchanged&#8230;that is if you want to deal with that. You may not even have such bad luck as me and you'll get a good part. In that case enjoy. No such luck with me and this company. Oh well. I hope someone finds this helpful

$review_text.: The Belkin Fuse Folio case allows you to adjust the viewing angles for optimal viewing and or typing.  It works well in that regard, but has an issue accessing the power and volume buttons.To insert the Galaxy Tab into the Fuse, you slide it into a sleeve, then fold a flap over and in to the sleeve.  Think of an envelope.  It works well at keeping the Galaxy Tab secure and gives you easy access to most ports, including the charging port.  The problem is that because the material surrounding the cutout for the power and volume buttons is too loose, the buttons are recessed underneath the cutout.  It makes it difficult to use those buttons.The exterior fabric is a grippy material that works well for a good grip, but I personally don't like how it looks.  A long elastic band keeps the cover shut when not in use.The Belkin Fuse folio case is a nice case overall, but the problems with button access keeps me from recommending it.

 However, I hoped to use it in my car with the optional cradle unit + remote via the line out jack


 While it does work, I am unable to run the unit on the cars power due to it going into PC Connected mode when I plug the cradle's USB cord into my USB to Car power adaptor

 I am forced to run its batteries down and then wait for it to completely charge before it can be used again

 If the batteries are not completely worn down to the point where the unit won't turn on it will not charge in my car
 I have to plug it into my PC to charge.If you plan on just using this as a standalone unit it is excellent
 Only when used with the optional cradle + remote package does it seem to fail my expectations.

$REVIEW.: As lots of high tech devices converge to a pocket-able size, many other high tech devices can use this, not just cameras.Neoprene is a really nice material for cases - it cushions and protects, but also stretches just a bit so you can get a snug fit.  It's also waterproof (although the seams aren't)This case had a very nice burgundy color neoprene with ballistic nylon trim.  The nylon is where I would think the case would wear most, so hopefully it will stay looking good.Good zippers.  Two pulls, they only go around halfway - I suppose this is so you can unzip without the device falling out.The neoprene is a good quality with none of that rubber smell I hate.I was a little disappointed that there was no clip, Carabiner or other attachment for it.  Fortunately I have a pile of little carabiners so I'll use that.  I guess I'm thinking something that would pass for a belt loop would be nice, but then it wouldn't look as clean and simple.The microfiber screen cleaner was a nice touch.The case was a great fit for our Pentax Optio but I also found my smart phone (HTC Touch Pro II) was a decent fit as was my Sony Bloggie camcorder.Likes- Microfiber cloth for cleaning- Ballistic nylon- NeopreneDislikes- Would prefer a pattern to help hide stains, wear.

$review_text.: I bought this for my friend's birthday and let me tell you this is quite the PDA. To start, it is powerful. While it is not up to today's top of the line standards, it DOES suffice for any writing, note taking, or even gaming you may do with this device.The screen is one of the best out there, sporting a big LCD screen with extravigant colors.Also, the thing is as light as a feather, easily the lightest PDA ever!The thumb pad in the center is good for all types of gaming and other controlling you may need to do!You can hook this baby straight to a computer to transfer data, connect to the internet (internet is also available via wireless blue tooth), and much more!The Toshiba e310 charges within minutes and it lasts long! And all of this is on the latest Pocket PC Operating system and all for a regularly low price on Amazon.com! Go get this PDA now!

$REVIEW.: For the few bucks I spent on this I am surprised at how well it worked, especially for night driving.  I wasn't looking for a crisp high quality HD camera, just one that would be good enough to show fault in a vehicle accident.  The sound recording wasn't bad either.  The interface could be better but only in that an extra button or two would be nice.  The menu is ok.  I love the cyclical recording.  All I am concerned about with this camera is capturing the last negative moment - the accident or incident.  With a large card, 8GB or more, this is doable.  Not a bad purchase but to have but it does leave a little to be desired in quality and I'll recommend it only for customers to see if a mobile/dash cam is right for them and if so stick with it or consider upgrading but either way, you haven't spent a whole lot of money such as with a $300+ GoPro camera kit.

$REVIEW.: I liked the idea of a slim case for my Tab since I really don't want to add bulk when I specifically bought a thin tablet! This one turned out to be too tight and the closing latch at the top was way to snug for comfort -- was afraid would scratch the table. I got the rooCASE slim-fit case that is very similar to this and strangely enough I noticed that for some reason it looked classier -- I didn't know why at first until I notice a subtle difference on the front cover. The MoKo has a folding crease on the front cover in addition to the back cover that is not on the rooCASE, and believe it or not it makes quite a difference. Don't know why MoKo and the other case makers have the crease at the front for the slim-fit cases (may be it helps with the different viewing angles) but I ended up returning this one and keeping the rooCASE.

$REVIEW.: I bough this TV for my den, and after doing research on all the 42 inch TVS, I decided on the Vizio, as it seemed to be the best value, without compromising anything. I can connect to the internet, stream from Amazon Prime(Netflix too), go on Facebook, Twitter, and several others. You cannot do google searches - there are limited applications, but it's plenty. Also, my son was able to get this TV up and running completely in about 15 minutes(he's 15). My ONLY negative, which doesn't bother me, is that it takes a bit of time for it to come on once you turn it on. Not a big deal but it's a bit longer than I'm used to from other TVs. All in all, I'd say this TV is an EXCELLENT TV and a GREAT value!! I even saw them give away the same exact one on ELLEN the other day!!

$REVIEW.: First: This product is awesome! You should buy one and give it a try
Understand that it is not perfect, but odds are in your favor that you (or the gift recipient) will be thrilled.Detail: I gave one to my mother and another to my in-laws last Xmas (2000) so that I could share pix of the grandkids across the country

I have enjoyed a full year of nearly weekly "best gift i've ever gotten" email/phone messages from both sets of parents


They all rave about it and show it off to everyone who comes to visit, most of whom are simply amazed (and not just by the cute grandkids :-)The Good:- One frame worked perfectly out of the box
The second one was a bit "finicky" to start but seemed to have straightened itself out after a day or two of uploads
Both have operated perfectly ever since.- The Ceiva website has been improved significantly since last year

Yes, some things are still clumsy, but everything works.- Both sets of parents tell us that they feel "connected" to what is going on out here, even though they are 3000 miles away.The Bad:- Email tech support is nonexistent
It *IS* as bad as people here have said
With luck, however, you should never have to use it
I have not had to try Ceiva phone support.- I was "lucky" enough to get in on their 7-year (aka


"lifetime") subscription plan for another ($) last year
It looks like they no longer offer that plan (as of 12/2001)

It also looks like they have raised their yearly subscription rate to ($) (from ($))
As much as that (...), I hope that it keeps them in business - losing my "connection" would be a terrible thing.- The black backing of one frame has started to buckle and look generally chintzy, however it still looks great from the front
I also hate the cheap-feeling buttons on the back, but you hardly ever need them.- Image quality is best directly in front, gets progressively worse as you move toward the side
Unfortunate, but ok.- Both frames exhibited the known "hidden picture" bug (thumbnail image loaded, but not showing on the frame)
This problem seems to have been resolved now.Tips/Thoughts:- If you plan to give one as a gift, I *DO* strongly suggest that you take it out of the box, register it (on the website), upload a bunch of pix (using your phone number) as a test (including a Happy/Merry/et.al
message on one pict!), then wrap it back up

That way it is "preloaded" out of the box and ready to go when plugged in (images are stored)
All you have to do is change the phone number on the website later and give the receipient the website username/pwd in the attached card.- Uploads are fairly painless over DSL


Dialup might be significantly more painful for a big batch of images, and even managing the frame contents as you are constantly reloading thumbnail images (one of the clumsy parts of the site design).- I keep passwords to both frames so that I can manage the images from home

The folks never have to go to Ceiva.com.- The in-laws leave it on all the time as a nightlight in their living room.In short, this is a great, well "targeted" (as someone below said) product

It does exactly what it needs to, and does it well from the "users" perspective
However, from the "managers" perspective (person uploading images) it's somewhat more painful, but still fine.The biggest issue is with SUPPORT, or lack therof
Ceiva *desperately* needs to fix this or risk aggravating their new (and old) customers.In my opinion, this product is one of the first truly integrated and exciting "information appliances" we've seen show up on the market


I hope Ceiva stays around long enough to get credit for an ingenious product that works
Enjoy!

The case is also small, good for me, small easy to carry or strap to belt, or snap on my back-pack w/ the carabiner. There is enough room for an extra memory card, but probably not enough for extra batteries. Fine w/ me, I don't snap enough pics to wear out the battery. If you like small and compact, easy to carry this is for you, if you like carrying a large sack of stuff like a pack mule, this will not work for you.

$review_text.: Update:My old review I have left intact at the bottom for your reference. I was having stability issues with Blue Iris, as it was crashing every day or two on my custom built high end PC. A fellow poster read my review and commented that my Antivirus was most likely the culprit. Being that I'm an IT Professional, I felt that I already checked this, as I turned off most un-needed features from my Antivirus. Well, I finally heeded his advice and checked again and sure enough, Avast had several behavior monitors running in the background that processed things such as network traffic. As soon as I turned off these hidden and un-needed features... Blue Iris has been 100% stable.If you are having stability issues, please look at your antivirus and what all it is monitoring.Old Review:Since I've installed this, I've applied every update than has been put on and yet the software typically crashes every day to day in a half of use and has to be restarted. No, the issue is NOT with the computer... I am an IT professional and am running this on a brand new high end machine with a fresh clean copy of Windows 7 professional 64 bit.I hope they fix the reliability of the software, as when it works it is absolutely amazing.

$review_text.: I bought this to replace a Denon 3311ci receiver that I'd been using as a pre/pro.I wanted simple, as opposed to bells and whistles that don't get used, but pay for anyway. Kind of like cable tv, and why I dumped it.Anyway, been extremely happy with the sound and performance. I thought out of the box the speakers sounded better than through the Denon. I'm using the same Anthem PVA7 amp. Can't comment on the Emotiva room correction as I haven't got to that yet, moving this coming month so will get to that later. No hdmi handshaking issues, and source switching is a little slow but not a dealbreaker. Like the on-screen display for volume and the menus are plain but useable.Sound and sight are both very good in my opinion. I think one of the advantages is the simplicity of it; keeping the unit simple means less to go wrong. And as I mentioned at the start, I don't like to pay for things that I don't use. This unit does what it was intended to, and well. I haven't needed to use tech support or warranty but will apprise if that need comes up.If you're in the market for a good pre/pro I don't see how you can go wrong. I realize it's not a Krell but it's not priced like one either.Cheers!

$REVIEW.: This mouse is incredible.I have trackpads, ball mice, the Evolent mouse, and a few other ergonomic mice. My favorite currently for use with my RSI is the OrthoMouse. It's a nice combination of the control of a regular mouse and an ergonomic mouse that doesn't pronate your hand as unnaturally. It's still not perfect and over long use periods hurts my hand. So I gave this a try.It holds like a pen and feels really, really relaxing. Many ergonomic mice relieve pain, but at the cost of control and precision. I do a lot of After Effects and graphic work and need control. This mouse feels like it would be great for that and I would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately it has an Achilles heel that makes it completely unusable.The scroll wheel is between the two mouse buttons on the top side of the mouse and it's completely unreachable and unusable without awkwardly un-griping the mouse and moving your hand back. If they put the scroll wheel in front of the two buttons or borrowed from the design of the OrthoMouse and added scroll up and scroll down buttons above and below the thumb rest this mouse would be so perfect. They could also add a scroll wheel horizontally just in front of the thumb rest like another manufacturer and that would be great as well.I really hope they revise this design because this has massive potential, but should be avoided for right now.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this camera in a kit with just about all the available accessories. Then, to further the deal, i ended up getting the pricey underwater casing that complements this camera. In a few simple words, amazing. This camera has shattered all of my expectations and then some. I face little to no problem with red eye upon taking hundreds of pictures. I went to the Milwaukee Domes and Botanical gardens and managed to obtain professional grade photo close ups on hundreds of flowers and pictures. With a 1gb sd card (only about thirty bucks outside a kit) you can take about 800 pictures on the highest resolution or about 8 minutes of video. The video is top notch, providing high quality sound and video that is good enough for putting on the television screen. This means if you feel like investing in say a 4 gb sd card, you can have upwards of 24 minutes of video, which is a pretty much all you would need for video recording (you'd be surprises how long 24 minutes is when you are playing it back on your computer)The battery life is amazing. Upon taking it to the gardens, the domes, Noah's Ark (to test underwater), a nearby park, a few other test runs one takes when they get a new toy, i finally managed to wear out the batteries that came with it. After that, I started using rechargeable batteries that came with my kit. I charged them once about three months ago, and I am still using the camera on there first charge after two months of camera use.The LCD screen seems a bit fragile, seeing as it is not completely attached to the camera from all sides (for its swivel feature). I have really only had a use for the swivel feature once with all my shooting, but it is nice to have and I wouldn't have it any other way.The one or two disadvantages is no internal memory, so if you forget to put an sd card in the camera, it doesn't function at all. Also, it isn't a small camera. Which means investing in a good case is a smart idea, especially if you got all the accessories and want to use most of them. (The one that came with the kit is lacking)With respect to the attachments one may think about getting with this camera, the filters are nice. there is a uv filter, pl filter, and another filter. The HD and wide angle lenses are lacking in practical use for the computer. They don't seem to help very much unless your intent on getting a full landscape picture that doesn't already turn out nice without. The other problem is that the flash produces a very pronounce shadow over the corner, meaning you have to turn the flash off if you are ever using any of the filters or lenses. (in other words, they can only be used in well lit areas). The stand that came with the kit is just some small short thing with bendy legs, not really useful for portraits, but pretty useful for trips if you want something to take a steady shot or if you want to be in your shot. The underwater camera case is nice, and unlike the filters and lenses, it comes with a flash blocker that keeps the flash from casting a shadow (unfortunately you can't use this for the filters and stuff). The casing is pricey, but if you consider they fact you can take very high quality underwater picts without having to buy expensive disposables and movies too, its worth it.Back to the actual camera, it has a large degree of modes, functions and speeds. For less experienced people, you can use the 5 some modes for auto set features. These include an in camera stitching functions for extreme wide angle views. What is does it takes a picture, then places the edge of the picture next to the screen of the current camera  view. This allows you to line up your shot and not make any mistakes with the stitch while taking the adjacent pictures. For those who don't know what a stitch is, a stitch is taking two picture side by side, then using a program to match them together, thus giving one continual shot. For more advanced users, you can manipulate hundreds of functions from how rapidly it takes photos to how long it get the image of the photo. You can also manipulate lighting, flashes, resolution, and a 100 other things in another five settings that range in what they specifically target (one mode concentrates on shutter speed, another concentrates on something else. You can also take sepia, black and white, and even underwater picture settings(a setting designed to decrease the blueness of water while using the casing). Also, the close up feature is very good, which allows the picture to adjust with every picture distance to give the optimum clear picture for close ups. (I use this extensively).Long story short (although it already is pretty long), this camera is definitely a great camera that anyone could find a great deal of uses for. I use it for everything and it has never given me any trouble. I have had it for four months and have not once come up with any major complaint. It still works fine and does not give me any problems. I come up with some of the most professional looking pictures one could expect in a high quality photo journal and its a camera that is not very expensive for what you get.

$REVIEW.: I've used Belkin computer accessories for years, so when I ordered the Belkin Chambray Standing Case for my Kindle Fire HD, I expected a quality product, and I wasn't disappointed
It's an impressive-looking case, with most of the features that I look for in a tablet case
(I wondered where the word "Chambray" came from, so I looked it up
It refers to a cotton plain weave fabric similar to gingham, which was invented by a Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste Chambray a long time ago.)After the appearance of the case, the next thing I look at is how the Kindle Fire HD is held in the case
In this case, the four elastic clips attach the tablet very securely

The front cover closes flat, and there's an elastic bungee to hold the cover closed
The folding mechanism is well designed and allows the Kindle Fire HD to be propped up in the landscape orientation at angles from about 45 degrees to almost vertical

It's a very effective design that keeps the tablet from slipping, even if it's bumped.For hand-holding, the front cover folds easily against the back, and if you want a little added feeling of security, you can slide your hand under the bungee.If you're looking for an economical, impressive-looking case for the Kindle Fire HD, you owe it to yourself to consider the Belkin Chambray Case.

$REVIEW.: I tried to connect this with a male Iphone cable end - NOT a docking device - so I could use my Android phone to play music in my car.  I previously had an Iphone cable connected to my cd radio in the car so I could plug in my Iphone and play music through my car stereo.  When I plugged the female end of the DockBoss into the male Iphone cable, the music from my Android wouldn't play through the speakers - so there is some kind of conversion problem.  So just make sure if you buy this, you are connecting to an Iphone DOCKING station.  Otherwise, this looks well-made and sturdy.
$SUMMARY.: Doesn't work when connecting to Male Iphone CABLE END

$REVIEW.: We ordered this right before our honeymoon; we took it snorkeling, kayaking, ATV-ing, and to the beach.  Some of our favorite photos from the trip came from this camera, not our DSLR.  Outdoor pics are clear, with crisp colors.  Indoors it's not quite as useful; lots of noise, slow focusing.  Can't do everything well, but it does quite a few things great.

$review_text.: Ok, to start I was looking at remotes in the $50 dollars each range, figuring you pretty much had to pay at least that to get something decent


Boy was I wrong, these less than $15 remotes do the job perfectly!I saw 3 reviews on Amazon that were pretty good, so I decided to head to Target to buy one first to test it out


When I got home I was able to plug in the DirecTV code so that the remote mimicked all of those keys under "SAT/CBL" ...

Then I decided that since the buttons I use for the TV are limited, I would just use the "learn" function for those specific buttons (i.e

Power, Input (for switching between TV, game systems, DVD, etc), and the scroll buttons (which you program left and right separately.) Worked like a charm! I suppose I could have searched a few of the included codes, but I figured "learning" 4 buttons was easier and quicker than trying 10 different codes


I programmed these under "TV" mode.Next I wanted to try my surround sound w/ dvd, which for some reason no other remotes ever had the code for


Since all I had to do was use the "learn" option again, that too works like a charm under "AUDIO" and it learned each button I need and use.I even taught the remote to learn my shelf stereo buttons AND my ceiling fan remote buttons (had to use the remaining "DVD" & "VCR" modes for these since they were unused, but who cares!) So now ONE remote controls 5 devices and replaced 5 remotes ......


it doesn't get much better than that =).I immediately went back to target and bought their last 2 remotes for 2 other rooms, and then I ordered the last 2 remotes I needed from Amazon since I bought the last ones Target had, haha.PROS (5):~ Cheap! Only $12-15 each (as opposed to $50, or in some ridiculous cases $150 each)~ Super Easy to program! Each remote took all of 5 minutes to set up all devices in that room.~ "Learning" functions: (every device or remote can be programmed even without its code)~ Repetition: All 5 rooms in my house now use the exact same remote, so it becomes very familiar to use~ If it ever breaks or gets lost, they are cheap to replace and reprogram.CONS (2):~ No backlit Keys: (so you have to use light from the TV or turn a light on to see the buttons at night)~ No combined remote programming for individual buttons: (in other words, some more expensive remotes allow programming of the volume buttons in the same device mode as the separate programming for the channel buttons, power button, etc

This would have been nice because you don't have to hit AUDIO to work the volume, then SAT/CBL to change the channel, then DVD to hit play, etc

With this remote you have to click each device button before performing that device's function) - (the only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)Honestly, for  $15 per remote (and $60 for all 5 rooms of my house) I think I can deal with the cons just fine


THIS REMOTE CAN LEARN ANY OTHER REMOTE'S SIGNAL! Control anything else that has a remote!UPDATE:I would like to reverse my comment about the AUDIO programming itself ....

I was, in fact, able to make the remote "learn" my surround sound volume in all device modes
This is nice, because now no matter what mode the remote it in "DVD/SAT/CABLE/TV" etc the volume works the same surround sound device across the board


EVEN BETTER!!!**Note: PS3`s use Bluetooth, which is a separate signal than most devices, so Bluetooth devices like the PS3 cannot be learned by this remote.Hope that helps!

$REVIEW.: For the money these are a great buy. The buds are super comfortable and stick in my ear wonderfully. They dont move around and they came with three sets of rubber tips to fit just like you want. They deliver very good sound and a pretty heavy bass when considering what they cost. They have a sturdy feel and I have paid more for earbuds that felt cheap and fell apart with just a few uses. I do not believe this will be the case with these.I got the glowing ones and they stick out in my gym bag when digging them out of my bag in a dark car. In regular light though they just appear white, which I like. The zipper works well and definitely works to keep them from tangling up. I like being able to customize the fit and they can be zipped up high keeping them close to my body or zipped down for a more relaxed fit that allows the wires to move more. Overall the cord is longer than I expected and should work with most any wear style.I am happy with the purchase and the ingenious design of them.
$SUMMARY.: Very Nice Buds!

$review_text.: I needed something that I could use to play mp3 without getting a whole new stereo


My factory stereo did not have the input for an mp3 player

This does the trick


For the price, you cannot beat it
The only thing that I do not like is the fact you cannot fast forward through the song if you do not like the beginning of a song
When you turn off the car, it will turn off itself
When you turn the car back on, the last song you played will start over
I got this for an mp3 player I have but I do not use my mp3 player in my car anymore

I just put my songs on a flash drive and use that now

It got to my house quick too
You can twist the adjustable shaft to make it fit into the lighter socket better for yourself too

The remote control has to be near for this to work as well but I only use that to change eq
I reccomend you buy this if you are sick of the radio and do not have a tape deck or any other input for an mp3 player

I would have spent much more for something like this


Go ahead and try it
I am happy with it.

$review_text.: I purchased this headset to use with Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Windows speech recognition. I've been using it for over a month with great success. Although I'm glad it comes with a USB adapter, I don't use it with any of my computers since it works great with all of the built-in jacks I've tried. I've transported a number of times and it's quite nice that faults up into a very small bundle not much larger than a mouse. This fold ability sometimes leads to a sloppy fit and some slipping, but once I get it positioned properly I can go for hours without adjusting it. It would be nice if the headset came with a small bag like my Logitech Bluetooth mouse. The size of the headset as well as the left-hand boom are adjustable enough but I imagine it would work for most people. My head is larger than average and I find it quite comfortable. It is incredibly light weight which is important if you intend to wear it for extended periods of time. The cord runs about 9 feet which is good since it allows for the option of limited movement and seating within a few feet. The in cord volume control and mute switch are handy, although I don't use them that frequently since I find it more convenient to disable my speech recognition via voice. I feel that this product is of sufficient quality that I should be able to get many years of use out of it and I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: This is a superior GPS system


 It's got Tom Tom traffic that lets you view live real time traffic information

 You can also check the latest fuel prices
 Google searches for shops and businesses in a given area are available


 There's  five day weather forecasts and even safety camera alerts to let you know where speeding and red light cameras are

 The machine only took a minute or two to set up and configure

 I happened on to a screen that told the number of satellites transmitting to the machine and I'm the type that finds details like that interesting
 That same screen shows latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes


 The user guide was much more detailed and helpful than some other Tom Tom products I have seen
 I especially liked the section called "Making Your First Trip"


 I enjoyed the touch and tap screen and the zooming features
The display is a little hard to read in the sunlight especially if for some reason you want to use it outside of the car
 All in all though if you need a new GPS this is a good system.

$review_text.: This is the third fan I bought from Noctua.I continue to be impressed by the workmanship of this Austrian fan producer. The fan is silent, yet produces a massive air flow of up to 92.3m3/h at 1300rpm and 19.8dB(A), which is barely audible from 1 yard away. You can also use two different extension cables to reduce the RPMs, airflow, and make the fan inaudible. Also, the fans come with great flexible rubber attachments for reducing vibrations, as well as classical screws. I usually use the rubbers, as they have the added benefit of quick installation. This particular fan ended up in a push/pull configuration for water cooling an I7 860 with a Corsair H50, and it works great.Throughout the last 20 years, I must have purchased around 20 different computer fans. I was never really satisfied until I found Noctua. If you're tired of funny noises coming from under your desk and want maximum cooling for overclocking your computer or a long life for your expensive hardware, get one of these: Simply terrific, strong and silent fans.

$review_text.: This is one of the class devices in the LED/LCD genre. The picture has stunning clarity and immense size. It's impressive even when it's off. And the screen is so thin (front to back) it's amazing. In terms of picture quality, despite the edge lit (rather than &#34;full array&#34; or &#34;back lit&#34;), the blacks are inky black and I see no light escaping at the edges. It's really good. I see no banding in images with shades of black. Color seems spot on. It's a great set.I also like that I can plug a thumb drive or hard drive with pictures or a videos into one of the USB ports in the back and watch a home video rather easily. The port should have been on the side however. Once I wall mount this, it will be harder to do such things. The two remotes seem to be largely redundant and unnecessary.There are some issues, however. The menus are elaborate and will take some getting used to. The images are so large and detailed that some movies tend to look amateurishly taped on a home camcorder. Slight movements in the camera are obvious on the screen, and this screen is unforgiving when there is bad focus in the original material. It seems that many sources are just not up to satisfying this monster's ability to resolve details. I also have a Panasonic plasma and the picture on the plasma just seems richer. But plasmas are going away and LED/LCD sets like this one do overcome bright rooms far better.I was torn between UHD and &#34;really large,&#34; and I concluded that UHD standards have not quite been decided upon and that I don't want to get a UHD set too early. Sets with H.265 and HDMI 2.0 are not yet available, for instance, and I don't know when they will be. So I went large. Having done that, I really do think that, even at this size, the performance of the set outperforms the readily-available sources.I don't think anyone will regret getting this set, unless it's just too big for their living room.

$review_text.: I bought this pen and notebook for my 17 year old son who has ADHD


 He has trouble focusing sometimes and has difficulty taking notes


 He thinks this pen is the best thing since sliced bread

 He's able to jot down a few notes in the special book using the livescribe pen
Then he listens to what went on the in the class when he gets home from school while reviewing his notes


 He then fine tunes his notes enabling him to better grasp what was taught in class.How does it work?  You have to use the special pen and notebook in conjuction with each other
You push record on the bottom of the page using the pen and then start to write

 It records everything that's said in the room and what you write on the paper

 You can listen to the pen on it's own but when you download it to your computer, the page that you wrote is downloaded (exactly the way it looks on the paper) right into the computer and then you can listen through the computer

We highly recommend this pen and book.

(Two had the left ear cut out, and two had the right ear cut out)  This happens after some time between one week and 9 months, but it will happen.  I think it's officially time to give up on these.  It's too bad, because the sound is fine (except the cord does transmit a lot of sound from brushing against things).

$review_text.: I ordered this before I took a trip to New Zealand and never regretted the purchase, until now. Granted, it is well-made and very comfortable if you like to hang your camera around your neck. However, when you mount your camera on a tripod, the strap becomes a nuisance. First of all, I find my self flipping it constantly to free it from the view of the lens or sensors in front of the camera. Secondly, if you are in the wind, the wide pad on the strap can catch the wind and shake the tripod assembly. I found myself wanting to remove the strap, or tuck it somewhere so the wind wouldn't catch it. I also don't like the strap ends hanging about. I've tried to adjust the length, but the loose ends still bother me. I have ordered another strap that is designed as a harness and lets the camera hang from the hip (Black Color Carry Speed Cs-1 MK II Sling Strap Rapid for Dslr). It also enables you to remove the camera from the strap if you want. We'll see if that solves some of the issues I've had with the Crumpler.

$review_text.: The product is quite adequate and functions well.  Don't believe their suggestion to buy a 256MB SD card however, unless you are satisfied with 2 or 3 state coverage.  I got the 1.0GB SD card and it gives me detail access to over 2/3 of the lower 48 states.  I found a quirk while being instructed to enter a south bound highway from the east.  It instructed me to go over the highway and make a "hard Left" (an illegal turn), rather than make the right onto the cloverleaf entrance.  Be careful. --The internal antenna works quite well but the placement, in my vehicle, required the use of an external antenna.  DO NOT BUY the Magellan External Antenna.  When the weather gets even slightly warm, the antenna sets off a continues false alarm on my Cobra Radar Detector.  Technical Support has been absolutely useless.  After 6 tries, I've given up and bought a Gilsson antenna that works much better, has no problems and costs less.  Magellan (Thales Navigation) either does not understand English or chooses to deliberately misunderstand the problem.  They will also not offer any refund on their antenna with the design problem. --In general, I am quite satisfied with the RoadMate 300, but don't expect any intelligent Technical Support.

$review_text.: I use the DM-50 on my Canon HV40 and am very pleased with it. The forward (full) shotgun mode is impressive, as well as the other settings. I bought a Mini Windjammer windscreen for it which helps eliminate wind noise.  I found a sound test for the DM-50 on Youtube.com where the tester recorded audio (with video) setting the mic in each of the three settings. That test sold me on the DM-50. I use a pair of full-ear headphones to monitor while shooting which is highly recommended.

$review_text.: Batch #303xxxx still has the left AF point issue. No green tint though, at least to my eyes. Good that I've bought this warranty that came with it, this should cover shipping to Nikon for calibration.Update: turned out that Squaretrade warranty doesn't cover items that were defective from the start, so that goes back to Amazon.Update: I've got a replacement from Amazon (very fast by the way) and the camera still has the same left focus point issues. Serial # is 3036xxx, so its basically the same batch as the one I've tried before. Though I've only tried 2 bodies, I have a feeling that all of these D800s are the same, including the D800Es. The reason why not everyone notices it is because its not that bad in real-life and you can see it clearly only under controlled conditions and with a fast lens wide opened.That being said, I'm keeping the camera. It's great otherwise, and I'm hoping to get it fixed some time in future when I send it out for sensor cleaning. I still got that Squaretrade warranty thing that should cover it. Nevertheless, the 3-star rating stays, because Nikon needs to pay more attention to their quality control, and that's the only way I can help it happen.Update: I have noticed oil particles on my sensor and had the camera shipped to Nikon for cleaning and calibration. Good thing I bought that additional Squaretrade warranty, because Nikon's warranty doesn't cover sensor cleaning. Anyway, my camera was calibrated, and now all autofocus points work perfectly.

It turns out because I had HDMI connected, I had to press the TVout button a few times until setting was for HDMI.Here's what I know:- It plays rmvb, avi, mkv.- It has 5 output settings: 2 HDMIs (1920x1080, 1280x720), 2 unknowns (probably Components, have not tested), and 1 AV (for old TVs).- It works with USB-powered external drives: WD Elements 750G and 650G.  Also works with 16GB SD card.- The remote is not the best I have seen but it works. If you lost the remote, you could still play files using the buttons on the device, just can't rewind/fast forward, ... By the way, the Fast Forward (2x, 4x, 8x) function is FAST!

$REVIEW.: I originally bought this for video because I was young and naive and thought that &#34;Ball Head&#34; meant smooth panning. It doesn't have a pan handle. It is a great photography tripod, though. It has a tough aluminum build, but the latches to extend the legs are getting dangerously close to snapping due to a lot of use. One great feature for video it has, however, is that you can transform it into a rig of sorts. It has levels which help you get a nice even shot, and it comes with a nice carrying case.

$REVIEW.: When I bought my first Camera I made sure to do my homework. I got the Sony P100. When it got stolen I replaced it with the P150 and eventually P200. I have used many other cameras though, since I do photography as a side job, and NONE compare to these 3 cameras. To begin with picture clarity is perfect in any mode. It also has many more available functions than the "more modern" cameras. Unless Sony starts making these again, I doubt I will buy their products anymore. The newer ones offer less functions and the picture quality doesn't even compare.I'm currently on the market for another one of these. I just decide if I prefer the P150 or P200.

$REVIEW.: Bought this for our vacation


Reviews were pretty good, but the bad ones were pretty bad! So I wasn't sure what to expect

The picture quality is pretty good, not professional quality-naturally-but good enough
When the flash has to charge it's a pain, missed some things I wanted pictures of because of it

The zoom's ok, very touch! (if you slightly bump the camera while taking a zoomed picture, it'll come out blurry)

The main thing I was worried about was the underwater/waterproof feature


The reviews on those have been the worst
We ended up not going to the water park like we had originally intended so I decided to wait until we got back home to try that feature...but my son dropped the camera into the ocean! Well, he dropped himself and the camera in


Luckily enough, it still worked fine! The pictures came out great, and the camera still turned on and off

I was impressed!

I saw that one of the knocks against it was it wouldn't stay put on a slick dashboard and indeed, I did have that problem with one similar to this I bought several years ago, Like all of these removable bases, the material on the underside does not always stick but that can be easily fixed.  All one has to do is get a tube of Silicone (clear?) caulk and evenly spread it on the under surface.  That makes it stay put on even the slickest dashboard surfaces. Once the base is fixed, this is a very easy to use and nicely portable item and I recommend it highly.

It worked immediately, right out of the box; I plugged it into my iMac's USB port, and it showed up on the desktop in a few seconds. Even formatted as it is for Windows, it would have worked fine for a data backup (music and photos), but I wanted to see if it would format correctly to use as a bootup disk for a Mac System backup drive. I was able to use Mac's Disk Utility program, and reformatted the drive in just a few minutes. The drive is working just fine, and the price is fantastic; I have just ordered another one.Update 8/1/2012: I just saw that Amazon raised the price by $10... this was a great item at $44.99, but $54.99 is still pretty good...Update 2/26/201: I recently got yet another one of these, a 500 GB version this time (Bought from Office Max only because I had some in-store rewards to use up), and again, I stand by everything in my original review.

$review_text.: Its nice to see a product like this that was put together with some actual engineering and forethought. Screen covers fit perfectly; big enough to cover what they need to and not so big that they reach over the bevel of the edge and try to lift off (like some others do). The microfiber cloth included is high enough quality to actually assist in cleaning your screen, and not leave MORE particles than it brushes off (like some others do). The dust grabbing stickers are a nice touch as well. Another nice touch; actual helpful advice in the instructions. The idea of installing it in the bathroom after running a hot shower really helped cut down on all the floaties in the air that always ruin these things. Nice packaging; all around a quality product.

$REVIEW.: This is a tough review. Many of the other reviews have touched on issues that may, or may not apply, and pretty much follow the lead of the internet photo pundits in content. They are legit issues, but not that important from my current perspective.OK, here it is... First, I'll answer the concerns about the halflife of the crop sensor camera in general. It's a non issue, as I see it. Nikon is committed to crop sensor cameras for at least a generation. Canon is in the same boat with their crop sensor cameras. Witness the latest Rebel XTi. It boosts Canon APS sensors to over 10 MP, includes new chip set, and makes the thought of a continued series of APS sensor cameras with new tech features a no brainer. Sure, Canon will be marketing full frame sensor bodies. Sure, I will buy at least one in time. Then again, my APS sized crop sensor cameras will always be the choice for certain jobs, and will keep all of my current and future "S" lenses employed for decades.I own some L lenses, and some full frame non L lenses, but my S lenses are the key to making APS sensor bodies excell. I already own two APS bodies, and if the new Rebel XTi is an indicator, I will own more in the future. Buying S lenses is not a sideshow, nor a dead end. It is just different.If you desire a full frame camera in your future, choose lenses wisely. Buy what you need for the APS sensor bodies, and buy the rest to suit both bodies. If you never buy a full frame sensor body, no big deal, as the APS cameras will keep you very happy for years to come.Meanwhile, I'll buy the next gen full frame Canon DSLR because I'm addicted to camera tech, but in the meantime, I won't starve my desire to fill out my APS body lens choices, as I know they will be around for many years to come.OK, back to the lens at hand. It's a fine lens by any standard. People who bashed it's build quality might have been led astray by internet influence, but I can't imagine any complaints coming from people who used the lens over time. It is a very well built lens, with very smooth control surfaces. It's not made of metal (the lens mount is), but it is a supurb quality lens. It is light. It is solid in construction. It is smooth. It's optical quality is nothing less than outstanding, and it is a pleasure to operate.Did I mention that it has IS? That is what places it above anything else on the market today. The 17-55 S IS is finely tuned glass. It is built well, and competition simply doesn't exist at this point in time. Sorry, but it's true. Where is the Sigma, Tamron or Tokina lens that can best the optics, focus speed, smooth controls, and IS of this lens? Hmmm... They don't exist.This lens isn't cheap, but it is the perfect addition to an APS sensor body as a standard zoom. Did I mention that it is f/2.8 from one end to the other? You can't beat this lens with a stick. Buy it.This lens, along with the 10-22 S USM make a powerful package for a Rebel owner, or a 10,20,30D owner. I added a 50 f/1.4 USM, a 100 f/2.8 macro lens, and the 70-200 mm IS L f/2.8 zoom to round out the package. Notice that only two lenses are "S" lenses, and the rest can be used on any Canon body. The S lenses were key though, as they let my 30D take awesome ultra wide angle shots to mild telephoto, while the full frame lenses allow it to get extreme on the far end with high quality results.Full frame might be in your Canon future, but APS is here now, and here to stay. You can buy a few S lenses today, use them for years to come, and buy more L lenses as they are retooled to include the IS feature. Other than the S 10-22 USM, I wouldn't buy a non IS L (or near L) lens at this point in time. I suspect that they will all be gone within a few years, and replaced by a better, all IS lineup.One last thing.. Several people have complained about dust problems with this lens. So far, I have not had any dust problems, and even though dust on the elements will not likely degrade the image, it is irritating to see. If my lens develops dust issues, I will post an update right away.
$SUMMARY.: Very fine lens. My choice for daily walkaround use.

$review_text.: Excellent camera, very proud to be a canon owner. I bought the body only, it came quick, and does what a camera does, I use it for video and photos, Its a step up from my T3i, a little over priced by about sixty dollars for just a camera body,  but an overall solid camera, The movie mode on this camera is spectacular, and I havent scratched the surface yet, get a good storage card, so you wont have to worry about the card not keeping up with the transfer of data from the camera. I will be purchasing this again, I want a second body, for other angles, does what higher end cameras do, so stop waiting, get you one!

$REVIEW.: The good news: linked with a 1/8" cord (not included), this sounds great. I tried it with my laptop music files and they came across as punchier, if a bit muffled. This JAM XT speaker is well-made and much more durable than others (I have one mono and one stereo pair of another brand which by comparison look and feel much less sturdy) which are expandable like mushroom shapes and so are portable, but both are flimsier in construction and not splash- or drop-proof as is this. The JAM XT suits the beach or the sand, perhaps, for its package. But the rubber door protecting the charge plug (you can't hear the speaker as it's USB charging, oddly) and input plug seems to be very fragile, and may not hold up for long to repeated use.The speaker is ingeniously packaged itself in a plastic 'jam' jar with lid and fits into the container so the charging cord (very short, less than 8") rests on top. A clever set up, and a carabiner allows the device to be worn or strapped, enhancing portability for an awkward shape.The bad news: I cannot get this to play in Bluetooth for two of my devices. It paired with 1) a Windows 7 laptop which kept saying a driver from Bluetooth needed to be installed, but it never does, and remains in "troubleshooting limbo." I visited the Bluetooth site, followed directions for the driver installation, but no luck as repeated attempts failed. So, I tried it with 2) a Mac laptop. That recognized the device in a few seconds, but again, it's paired without connecting wirelessly. That is it does not play sounds even if the device is shown on Apple to be paired. Last resort with 3) Android phone. Finally, it did play sounds from that third device.So, it's not always wireless as intended. With a wire, it's satisfying, so it's a disappointment that despite its size, rugged design, and promising sound output, it cannot be used by me as designed to be wireless for either laptop. If anyone has a solution, kindly share; I checked the tiny manual and have repeated over and over the attempt to get my Windows 7 laptop or an Apple one to not only recognize but to play a sound without a wire. (If this problem has a fix, and it works for me, I will revise.)

$REVIEW.: When I was offered this drive for testing, the first thing that struck me was the 'NAS' designation

 Since I had only the bare drive and my NAS enclosures were already committed, my tests of the drive followed a more conventional pattern


 Before we get to that, let's explore the NAS term

 This refers primarily to the firmware on the drive as well as the disk controller itself


 It's tuned for quieter operation and lower vibration, perhaps making the difference on whether it's acceptable to unobtrusively run the NAS inside an office


The relatively large cache, as well as the 6GB transfer rate, mean that a burst of data can be sent to the drive quickly, allowing the NAS to proceed to the next drive inside the array
The self-maintenance aspects of the firmware also are designed to keep the system running around the clock.My Mac Pro had a spare slot, so my tests were focused on the drive's use as an internal backup

 External backup is critically important, but Apple's Time Machine software can give you a quick and easy way to fix momentary losses
 Once the drive was installed, I could see that it rotates at 5900 RPM rather than the more typical 5400 RPM of so-called 'Green' drives
 This is too slow for a main system drive (which should be 7200 RPM or greater), but is a noted improvement over 5400.No drive goes into my system without a complete surface test

 Such a test not only checks the disk for surface integrity, but also gives some good clues about thermal performance under load as well as sustained speed
 Tests on my 3TB drive completed in just over 5 hours, which is quite good
 Testing the drive for speed (with an appropriate diagnostic application) gave me pretty consistent numbers above 130MB/sec


 This is below the Seagate-quoted spec, but specs are idealized

 The speeds I reached were actually quite good for a low-speed disk--just below the 150 MB/sec of a RAID-0 pair of 5400 RPM drives in my system


 This drive is more than adequate for the backup application I had in mind
 I also believe this would be an excellent performer inside a NAS array or any other sort of RAID structure.

$REVIEW.: The same thickness as a pack of smokes, and slightly wider and taller, this compact battery packs a decent wallop.  It's not perfect, but it's close.There are two built-in cables (red) - for convenience. While these are handy, they have issues - that's why only four stars. They provide less amperage than the built-in USB port. Even more annoying, the Lightning cable won't stay in the battery. I would up bending the corner of the battery back a little so it would grab better.As I mentioned, there's a built-in USB port. For some reason, this charges faster - so it gets more amperage.  If you provide your own USB cable you can charge your devices about 2x faster.There's no power button - the device automatically starts charging whatever device you attach. To see the current battery charge, tap the pack. I found that it took a decent rap with my knuckles. There are four blue LED's that indicate the current charge level, each representing 25%.  Four lights=100% - pretty simple.It's a convenient and compact design with a couple of minor issues. 8400 mAh for the price is a pretty good deal.

$REVIEW.: I was reading all the negative reviews and bought this anyway.  I think maybe this company has updated this product and I have the newer version  It fits perfectly on my iPad 3.  Snapped right on nice and snug.  When you hold the iPad by the edge it does not come off.  I like that it locks in my leather smart cover magnet perfectly and matches well.  The magnet is strong on the apple smart cover but I have found it does moe around and come off, so this iblason locking inn the magnet is a nice feature.  The space around the dock connector is more than large enough for the charging connector AND both camera connectors.  Before I got this I had had ghost armor applied which was a real waste of money.  Finally ripped the ghost armor off the screen as it was coming off around the edges and I wasn't going to waste more money getting it reapplied. But left it on the back even though it was bubbling.  This case seems to fit right over the ghost armor on the back no problem, so I guess the ghost armor may at least protect the back of this case slides a little.  I read lots of the reviews of this product about cracking.  The material mine is made of seems quite flexible and forgiving.  Will have to see if it cracks.  For right now I love it.  I really like my leather smart cover even though apple has it way over priced.  But now with this case I can use the smart cover but also protect the back.  And the gray color matches my blue smart cover very well...  Please remember, this is just a back protector.  One reviewer was very mad that it did not come with the smart cover.  But it clearly says the smart cover is not included.  One closing thought.  If iblason wanted to improve this product they would add a magnetic strip that would hold the smart cover open.  Only downfall, although not really a major one.  Great back cover for the price.  I'm quite pleased.Update November.  Yup. Just like others said.  It cracked right at he corner.  Started with a little crack.  Then a whole piece of the corner fell off.  I'm going to try and call company and see if they will replace.

$REVIEW.: Or do you just have better uses for your time?  In either case this little gadget can  save you a lot of time, trouble, and headaches (literally, from banging your head while crawling around underneath your desk) by securing the ends of disconnected cables and wires on top of your desk where they belong rather than letting them slip down behind.  So long as the wire end connector is at least a quarter inch around, there is no danger of it pulling through.  (Thinner end connectors can be secured by pinching them between the loops a little bit higher in the slots.)  Even a coaxial cable with connector can be secured by running it through the hole in the side of the loops.Defects?  Well, as other reviewers have noted, it is a little light.  Hook up a bunch of heavier wires and cables, and you risk having it pulled down behind your desk by the sheer weight of the wires themselves.  If you expect to be using it in that way, you may prefer the heavier, more expensive model:Quirky Metal Cordies Desktop Cable Management for power cords and charging accessory cables.

 I eventually sold that laptop and bought a new laptop that came with a newer, different style adaptor

 The newer adaptor totally lost its plastic sheath and the inside wires were exposed and it looked a mess
 I eventually purposefully sought out the  style that my old laptop used to use, because I had it for years without it fraying
 I found this one and I have now had it for longer than I had that adaptor that frayed, and it is still in perfect condition

 However, it comes out of its socket far too easily
 Sometimes just moving the laptop a little bit makes it pop out.

$REVIEW.: I bought the "older" version of these (not the "newer version is available" which cost $10 more.  Although the picture shows the buds as having the "Logitech" they are the new model with the "UE" logo.  $16.00.Base reproduction is far superior to most "cheap" earbuds and miles and miles better than the crappy headphones apple sends you.  The inserts that came on the headphones fit me perfectly, but they come with multiple other sizes larger and smaller.  I found myself listening to songs I had tired of b/c I forgot how good they sounded.  I also owned a pair of Shure SE215's which cost about $85 more.  I'd put these right in the middle of those and your standard cheaper buds...which I guess means I'd rate these as worth about $50 worth of sound.  Sound isolation (that's what it is...not "active" noise reduction like Bose's headphones) is very good...I was able to lower the volume limiter on my ipod by two notches in comparison to the cheaper JVC buds I had been using.The plastic carry case is nice, but cheap, and the plastic hinge is going to break sooner rather than later.  That's ok b/c I store them in a case with my ipod, but if you count on the case it doesn't look long for this worldIn summary, the review is for the headphones, and at $16.00 you will be amazingly happy with your purchase regardless of what kind of music you listen to.

I was thinking of an iPod Nano 7th generation, but I figured that I don't need all the goodies for an extra $50
Buy this if your only sole purpose is for music

Get an iPod Touch if you wanna play games, read some news, view weather, etc

Also I've uploaded pictures of the front, side, and back with some notes if you want to look at it on the top of the pagePros:- The red color is gorgeous

P.S
The FRONT of the MP3 is shiny and the BACK is matte red
Which is good since matte is hard to scratch.- Ease of use: Listening to music, transferring songs to MP3, and the radio.- The stock headphones that came with this are pretty good! I'm not an audiophile- Battery life is excellent I've played it for 2 hours now and I'm only down to 3/4 battery


Better than iPod (expected)- They have a 'hold' button so I can use it and not accidently press other buttons while I'm jogging and it's in my pants.Cons:- At this price? Nothing.

$REVIEW.: First, I couldn't mount the hard drive AND the fan in the drive bay. The brass nuts are lodged in hexagonal holes so they are held fast but the nut spun around making it impossible to tighten or unscrew. I had to use channel lock pliers turning and pulling at same time to get the screw out. No way to secure a screw through the hard drive cage onto the hard drive adapter unless, maybe, if you drilled another hole. I doubt it though. I gave up with mounting the drive onto or with the fan armature and returned it to the original bay with its 'Cool Blue Color Hard Disk Drive Cooler'. I put the computer back together and turned it on only to notice only one fan spinning. The airflow is undetectable. I'm going back to my 'Evercool SB-F3 &#34;Fox-3&#34; System Blower Fan'. That puts out some air, but I need to mount it upside down because the fan makes noise.

$REVIEW.: I used this case three or four days a week for a little over two months and then the metal hook on the side that holds the shoulder strap snapped in two.  Thankfully, I had just finished going down stairs when it failed so the computer only dropped 2 feet....  So, while it is a great bag while it lasts, it is absolutely not worth the money.  My original five star review is below.*****************As lots of people have pointed out this is a nicely put together case. The handle is comfortable, the zippers and stitching feel solid and it has a great clean look.One thing that others have not mentioned is that it is very light. If you are already carting around a 17 or 18 inch display you may not think the ounces or pounds in your case will matter but I was very pleasantly surprised at the difference this one made.The padding for the PC is good but not great. The compartment to hold the computer has a good nicely padded divider so you can adjust down the size to snugly fit a 17 inch display (like a big MacBook) and the edges of the case feel sturdy even given the light weight. One possible concern is that the large exposed surface is only padded by the thickness of the case's plush cloth. It feels adequate for every day use but if you are used to the "bubble wrap" or "egg carton" padding of a Timbuk2 messenger bag this seems a little thin.

$review_text.: I own a 56 inch Samsung DLP (have for some time now) and love the thing. So when it was time to get a flat screen for my bedroom (the old CRT just had to go), I went right to Samsung. My needs were 32 inches, 2 or more HDMI inputs, at least one analog composite input, at least one analog component input and a QAM tuner. I looked at a few models from other vendors (the usual suspects, Sony, Toshiba, Hitachi, etc., excluding Visio, not a chance that junk enters my home) and for the most part they were very similar in the features they offered. This model was a little better than some of the others in the same price/size range and it had some extra cool features (ability to display images from camera) and given my past experience with Samsung, I purchased this model.I mounted the TV to the wall (using a Cheetah) and cannot be more pleased. The QAM tuner found all of the cable channels that were available (although it would have been nice to just have it hunt for digital channels, I had to go back after the hunt and manually remove the analog junk). The other inputs worked as expected. The remote control is not bad but it lacks a button to turn Closed Captions on/off (you need to navigate the menus to turn on/off, what a hassle). Picture quality is great, and the sound is what you expect for built in speakers (not great, but sufficient)All of that said, I give this baby two thumbs up...

$review_text.: The other reviews here are very good and detailed. I purchased this unit based on them.  No need to rehash what they have said.  I got the unit on a Friday.  Loaded the programs onto my Intel dual Mac running Windows XP PRO.  Learning curve delayed me until Tuesday.  I now have 600mb of data stored on the removable sd card.  The maps-both street and topo are great.  This unit works great!  It is as advertised.  It is small and rugged.  Just what you need for off roading of any kind.

$review_text.: I waited a while before writing a review because of other reviews and seemed too good to be ture. One day our TV stopped working and the green light in the very corner was now red. So I knew lamp or something was broken. After a quick google search I found out it was the lamp. I called the local TV repair place and the guy told me it was $185 for the lamp and $75 to come and switch them out. I googled a how to video and replaced it myself in less than two minutes.I can't express how easy it was pop the old lamp out and the new one in. I'm not really good at doing things like this and always worry I'm going to break something and between us, don't tell my husband, he isn't good stuff like this either. I was really worried that I had the wrong item because of the vast price different. But after reading all the other reviews I took a change. I felt like the smartest girl in the world for saving so much money and doing it by myself. Posted my story on fb share with other how much money they can save if something like this happens to them and to brag a little about smart I was. haha. Clearly I'm really pleased with my purchase, next day delivery which was great because we have two little girls and I can't take too many days without Dora and Spongebob's help.

$review_text.: The Gigabyte GTX 770 is a fantastic GPU that will crush just about any game you throw at it. The Windforce triple fan system keeps the card really cool, generally below 70C even in the most demanding games, and stays extremely quiet because three fans share the workload instead of two, which results in lower RPM for each fan and less noise. Gigabyte as a brand is top notch, I've never had any serious issues with their products and anything small I have contacted them about was dealt with promptly.Before the price drop of the GTX 770 and 780 I would have said the GTX 760 carried the best performance per dollar ratio for GPUs. Recently the 770 has dropped from $400 to $330 while the 760 has stayed the same at about $260, which gives the 770 a significant performance boost for the minimal price difference of $70. The card generally only has a 10-15% percent performance gap with the 780 but costs $190 less, that's insane. It can also easily play 1440p at high framerates, unlike the 760. For these reasons, the 770 has reached a perfect middle ground of high performance at a (relatively) low cost.One thing to note is that this card is basically a tweaked and overclocked 680. This means that the headroom to overclock is rather slim. If you are looking to go crazy with the overclocks you may want to look elsewhere, I got mine to +78 coreclock to 1300MHz and ran a tad hot at about 76c.
$review_summary.: The GTX 770 is the best bang for your buck

It's more for a fashion statement than actual protection of your computer. It has zero padding inside, and I mean zero. It's just faux fur and linen lining.

$review_text.: I have this remote for my Nikon D80.  It's handy and very quick.  To put your camera in infrared mode, press and hold the Continuous Mode button on your camera, and then slowly turn the thumb wheel on the back of the camera.  As you do this, the icon for your shooting mode will flip through single, multi, timer, etc. When the icon looks like this remote, let off the Continuous Mode button and now you're ready to shoot.You can take pictures up to 16 feet away, but there are some considerations:- If you're using a large, bulky zoom lens, the infrared remote will need to be held at the right angle to still reach the sensor.- The sensor on my D80 (and probably most Nikon cameras) is on the upper left-hand side of the camera (if you're facing the lens, this is your right-hand side).  You will need to have the remote on that side and pointed in the direction of the sensor, just like you would for a television remote control.This remote is easy to use, and thankfully if you aren't manually setting your focus, it really does focus the lens for you before you shoot.  Very useful.

$REVIEW.: I already own the Onkyo TX-SR606 Home Theater receiver so I was thrilled to be able to review this one.  Audio buffs will already know how impressive the TX-SR606 is but how does the HT-RC160 rate?  Well to me this is a better receiver.  I was certainly more impressed with the video switching.  I have always had an issue with the TX-SR606 because it seems to have stability problems when switching video but there are no problems with the HT-RC160.  The sound on both is very similar and this is compatible with all the modern formats such as DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD. The beautiful thing about Onyko is that they make true receivers and they don't make glitzy gimmicky ones.  Yes this is a home theater receiver so it needs more buttons than a standard receiver/amplifier but Onyko still stay true to the foundation of all quality home audio.  An audio buff friend of mine once said to me 'a good receiver should only need a volume control'.  Of course this one needs more than that because it is designed for home theater but it isn't over the top.Connecting this receiver up wasn't a difficult task for me because the connections are similar to the TX-SR606 but I would say you should put some time aside.  Similar to another reviewer, I found that this receiver will run any speakers.  I have different make speakers in each area but this receiver matched everything up.  As far as video, you wire everything to run through the HDMI output.  So connect all your gadgets into the necessary inputs and this will switch it.  This receiver has 5 HDMI inputs which is more than enough for any modern equipment such as a Blu-Ray player, X-Box 360, Playstation 3 etc.  The only thing you really have to do is match up everything up once it is fully connected which you can do via the on-screen set up.Overall I love this receiver, the sound quality is excellent and the video switching is flawless.  I can't fault it in any area and if you want to go with a company who build true audio then you can't go wrong with Onyko.*UPDATE*I researched the stability issue I got with the TX-SR606 and it turns out it was a problem with the HDMI switching.  This is caused by some very low voltage surface mounted capacitors which dry up.  There are 5 of them which are 100uf 4v.  Replacing these with higher rated capacitors (100uf 16v)  will solve the issue.  You don't have to use surface mounted capacitors, you can just use standard capacitors.  If you have soldering experience and some knowledge of electronics then it is a semi-easy job but if not then your local electronics repair shop should be able to do this.  The bad news is my HT-RC160 went the same way so I had to replace them on this one too.  I am not changing my rating for this item but Onyko you have a serious issue here.

But, in order to get deep black colors you have to shell out a lot more money. So for the price, I think this is the best TV in the market today. i would recommend it to anyone. Amazon was awesome. The guys came in, unwrapped the TV and installed it. Very good service. If I were you, I would not give a second thought to this TV.

 Follow the on-screen instructions on Almond's touch screen.That was it and presto my 2 to 3 bars are now a solid 5 on my office on the 2nd floor extending the router on the 1st


 It can't be easier than this.Read the reviews and knew this ahead of time;We will have a new firmware available in late September that will address the &#34;Network Name - Almond&#34; drawback you mentioned

It will give you the flexibility to make the repeater network name (SSID) the same as the main router's network (SSID).So when you're setting this up, remove the &#34;- Almond&#34; from the  &#34;Network Name - Almond&#34; and you will not have to change any of your other network settings

$review_text.: For $8 this thing is a no brainer.  The only reason it doesn't deserve 5 stars is the little tab that lets you turn it into a stand doesn't seem like it would last for a long time without starting to bend outward and get in the way eventually.  Because of that I don't see myself using it in stand mode very often.  But if like me you don't really care about that and really just want a slim protector without extra junk, this is spot on.  Last point that doesn't merit a star drop, no pen came with it and the loop design for it is obvious in the pics so anyone buying this already knows it isn't hidden away, I plan to just snip off that bit to make the case slimmer.

$review_text.: I bought 4 people this cable and I have request to get more of them for friends of those people. The cable feels very durable and not cheaply made like the other ones on amazon that are $6.00 or less. Yesterday, I hooked up my uncles new 3D TV and 3D blu ray last night and it worked without a hitch. The movie looked amazing. The one and only blu ray he had was Thor 3D, and it displayed at 1920x1080@24p. I also used the same cable to connect my PS3 to his TV, which is a Samsung 7000, to play Uncharted 3 in 3D, and though not the quality of the Thor 3D, it still looked awesome and graphics and text were very sharp. We were at Best Buy to get the Thor 3D movie, and we bypassed HDMI cables that were $30 to $250. It's absolutely absurd to spend more than $15 for an HDMI cable. We had to pick up a Digital Optical Cable that night (their receiver doesn't have any HDMI inputs/outputs) and the lady there was trying to tell me that the $40 Optical cables were better than the $15 cables. I told her "I think as long as the signal flows, and has a decent build it should all work the same".. she didn't say anything. Back to the HDMI cable, every time I recommend this cable, I am the one buying it for people. I'm going to switch out all my $1.72 HDMI cables with these cables. When you think about it, $10 is still insanely cheap for an HDMI cable that supports 3D and is the newest version available. And for it's high quality build its worth spending $30 on 3 cables. Thank You Mediabridge and thank you Amazon for your Amazon Prime services! I have saved more money for myself and for my friends and family by being a member.

Contacted P.C.Universe by e-mail with a very NICE inquiry as to the price and was ignored.  Nothing-zip-nada from them.I have purchased a great deal of products through Amazon, and this is the first time this has happened.Have always heard horror stories about internet purchases, but have always been lucky.  Amazon has always been great to deal with and I certainly will continue to use their service, but "let the buyer beware".  Eight bucks is no big deal, but what if it was $500 on the price of a new plasma tv.  Hope P>C> Universe got coffee and donuts for their staff, because they won't ever get any more of my business.

$review_text.: I will admit I was skeptical about this product.  Most things at this price with moving parts usually leave something to be desired, right?  Not this.  My iPad Mini case (Griffin Survivor) came with it's own stand, but it doesn't stand vertically, and just isn't comfortable to travel with.  This is a GREAT alternative.First of all the construction is great.  It is made of durable yet light weight plastic.  it is adjustable for a wide variety of viewing angles, from 90 degrees to about 30 degrees, depending on your preference.  The legs that serve as the base can be positioned wide or narrow, and your tablet will fit by itself or with the case on, no problem.  I tested it with the Griffin Survivor as well as the Otterbox Defender, both are find.Finally, all the contact surfaces come with a skid proof rubber layer, so you don't have to worry about it sliding around.Overall a great product useful for a variety of purposes.

$REVIEW.: I needed a heavier duty tripod for my larger video camera.  This is very sturdy.I really like the fact that I can tilt the camera and the tripod holds it where I stop.  My previous tripod made me tighten down a wing nut to keep it at the new position.  I have not used other high end video tripods so can't compare to other tripods.It does feel a little stiff with I pan.  Since I want to pan slowly this isn't a big deal to me.It came with two camera plates.I got a bonus extra lightweight tripod.
$SUMMARY.: Nice sturdy tripod for video

$REVIEW.: Obviously with all these positive reviews you know this is a good product.  I bought it for gaming in the hopes that all those opinions were valid and that this chip lived up to the hype.  Well, it does.  Completely.  In fact, if such a thing is possible, it outperforms the hype.  If it lasts as well as it performs then it will be in a category all its own.  If you want a gaming computer and a processor that does that expertly, this is the chip for you.
$SUMMARY.: Just wanted to add to the 5 star reviews, cause it deserves it.

$review_text.: We have several different brands of laptops here at work:  Acer, HP, an old Sony, and an old Gateway, this portable speaker attached to every one of them; (update:  it also fits just fine on my Dell at home).From a female's perspective, I found this speaker to be cute, as far as speakers go - it just looks nice, period.  But besides being cute, it's also designed well - inside the clip section there is rubber cushioning so it won't scratch your computer.The sound is fairly good, but don't expect Bose-quality.  It's easy to install - just plug in the USB cord - each computer found the hardware immediately whether it was XP, Vista or Windows 7 - I tried on all 3 OS's.The USB connection is on the back, along with a 3.5mm jack for an MP3 player (you would have to play this while running through the computer).If you don't want to clip it on your PC, it also has rubber feet on the bottom of the clip so you can just sit it beside your computer if you wish to do that instead.It also comes with a drawstring carry case, in addition to the USB cord.
$SUMMARY.: Good speaker, fits all laptops I tried, kind of cute too!

$review_text.: I have never owned an Apple product


However, my wife owns an iPad 4 that her work reimbursed
This is my first Android tablet, but I've played around with many
This is the first Android tablet that has been able to convince me to buy

I also own a Galaxy Nexus smartphone and two 5" Samsung Galaxy Players (for kids,) as well as the original Kindle Fire that my 3 year old uses.What convinced me to buy?o Thin and lighto Decent battery lifeo Higher resolution screen w/16:10 ratioo Waterproofo IR blastero Elegant designo Sony claim to upgrade Android OSDoes the tablet live up to my expectations?Thin and Light: Extremely impressive! This tablet is so thin and light for a 10" tablet

After using iPad 4 with protective case, this brings a smile to my face when I pick it up


If thin and light is a top concern for you, this is the one
Even my kids love holding this...so much so that my 8 year old thinks it's hers!Decent Battery Life: The battery life of the Tablet Z varies widely

When frugal to moderate, it can easily achieve the claimed battery life of around 8-10 hours

The way I use it with Wifi on,I typically get around 8 hours use

The screen brightness has the biggest impact
When full bright, it will drain the battery very quickly, 4-6 hours depending on what you are doing

With full bright, the AC charger can't even keep up during use

Your battery will keep draining

Even bringing down brightness to about 80% makes a big difference


Around that point, the battery starts to charge back up when plugged in and using the tablet

At 50%-65% seems to be a good balance between brightness and reaching the upper levels of battery life claim.Higher Resolution Screen: The reason I didn't bite on tablets such as the Note 10 is because of the resolution
It isn't bad, but not great
The Tablet Z is sharp, but compared to my wife's iPad 4, it's noticeably behind

If you don't compare to the iPad 4, it is really very good


The 16:10 ratio offers closer to a 1080P experience once softbars are in play

For this reason, I appreciate the 16:10 (1920x1200) resolution

Like any other large tablet, it is harder to type with both thumbs in landscape mode

However, portrait mode is better for typing

Color saturation is not overdone and yet renders colors well.*UPDATE 14 AUG 2013* I bought a great little app from the Google Play Store called "Thumb Keyboard" and it makes typing in landscape much much better by offering a split keyboard
It works perfectly with this extra wide tablet

It even helps typing in portrait mode become a better experience

I love that I can add custom mapped buttons on the top row for items like the comma and apostrophe


I am typing this update from the Xperia Tablet Z

Of course, this app can be used on any tablet or phone.Waterproof: We all like a little novelty
The waterproof claims are good

I have the freedom to use this tablet in places I wouldn't dare with other devices

I've used it in the tub, shower, pool, and even wash it in the sink


What you need to know, though, is that if you completely submerse the tablet, it is not functional due to the fact water does conduct electricity

The screen gets confused and does crazy things as if one were touching it all over the place randomly

The good news is, if watching a movie in the tub and it gets splashed, it can take a fair amount of splashing without acting like it is completely submersed

To keep it waterproof, the power, headphone and SD ports have covers on them


Especially power, can be a bit annoying taking on and off all the time

The flap can get in the way while plugging in the power cord
Even with a tiny "latch" to hold the cover when off, it does not hold tightly and gets jarred off easily

I'm used to it and willing to live with this minor inconvenience for the waterproof ability.IR Blaster: If you love TV and want a universal remote, this tablet works well

You can customize the layout, although it isn't always the easiest experience

 Bottom line, it works
I've always been interested in the Logitech Harmony remotes and with this, I no longer care to spend money on those remotes

Considering how expensive some of those are, this could be a nice justification in and of itself

The TV guide-like functionality does require an app download
I've used it and it is neat


It works
I set up my Samsung TVs and Bluray players with little fuss
It just worked.Elegant Design: This is subjective, but I think it is very nice looking compared to Samsung tablets


It's simple and elegant
I don't mind at all showing it off.OS Upgrade: I am currently on Android 4.1.2
It came with 4.1.1

I'm still waiting on 4.2, which is supposed to allow multiple user accounts
As of August 5, 2013, I heard 4.2 is around the corner with 4.3 being pushed out even later

While not here yet, I do appreciate knowing I can eventually get those upgrades.Other Notes:o I wish this had a dedicated button/switch to lock screen rotation like the iPad 4
As is, it takes 2 taps just to get to the menu
Other key settings that people want to change on the fly are also two taps away just to see the options

I'd rather it be only one tap away

Since Sony lightly skinned the Android OS, I'd like to see this change


This includes screen brightness, WiFi on/off, and Airplane Mode.o Camera picture quality is so-so

It's there

It needs very good lighting to take decent pictures

There is no LED light.o Video is the same as camera notes.o Sound quality was highly touted by Sony

In reality, speaker does get good loudness, but quality isn't anything impressive


In fact, when loud, it kind of hurts the ears

Compared to iPad 4, the Sony sound lacks much full body and depth and richness
iPad 4 wins hands down
I also own a couple of very high end headphones from Audez'e and HiFiMan and the sound with those headphones plugged in  is better


It's not as good as my Cowon player, but it's good.o Price/Value: Honestly, I'd say it isn't worth the high price unless you must have thin and light and waterproof features


These are the areas it stands out compared to other 10" inch tablets and where the others are lacking


I was willing to pay for the thin and light, and am happy with the purchase for that reason alone.Conclusion:Mainly because it could be better in the value department, and because of a few other nitpicky points, I give the Sony Xperia Z Tablet 4 Stars

The Sony and iPad each have their appealing points
The choice comes down to which OS environment you want, and which features mean the most to you.

I tried to reset it multiple times and reinstalled firmware, but just didn't want to work. Both operating systems recognized that it was connected, but no sound.

$review_text.: I was wary about ordering a cheap collapsible light reflector but was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the Neewer 43" reflector. It unzips to show a white bounce and includes a gold and silver one. This one is large enough for creating enough bounce while it collapses into a smaller 8 inch ring with it's nifty carrying bag. It's a bit tricky to get it to collapse the few times but if you're gentle and patient it gets easier and easier. I think it's a good pick up for the price.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this lens in September '07 after I spent a week in FL and I was tired of changing between my 17-70 & 70-300
 During those changes, I often missed good shots
 I considered the Tamron 28-250 VC
 However, I wanted the extra mm at the wide angle end


 Also, I realized there was not a large difference between 200mm & 250mm at the telephoto end.The first test was a trip to Turks & Caicos where the lens worked beautifully

 However, after a few months, I noticed extreme vignetting in photos at the telephoto end


 Also, I noticed my images were not as sharp.I read about the potential trade-offs when I purchased the lens
 However, I figured something must be wrong with it.I sent the lens back to Sigma and they fixed the vignetting and the sharpness has improved


 I'm pleased with the lens and I higly recommend it as a travel lens.I have a Tamron 28-75 F/2.8 that produces sharper images

 Yet, I enjoy the convenience this lens gives me
 For everyday and travel photos, it is a great buy.-Roger

$review_text.: This tv is guite amazing for how cheap it is.  Especially with free truck delivery service I'm not sure why anyone would purchase a TV from anywhere else but Amazon.  I bought this TV because the previous Samsung TV (42") was too small for my Living Room which is fairly big at 12x 22 square feet with raised ceilings.  So I decided that the 50" would be just perfect and it turns out the size is just right. Yes, this TV is only 720p but it has such clear images that you cant help be amazed.  When watching tv using a bluray dvd player or my apple tv the images come out amazingly crisp. In fact the only time you will notice a little bluriness is when your real close to the tv and it is not on an hdtv channel. So if you have cable make sure you choose the HDTV option or else your seriously missing out.  the only other problem with the image is that sometimes I see a red glare in the tv that looks a lot like a laser light moving around from inside the tv. But this only happens once in a while and quickly goes away. Also, be aware that this is a plasma tv so make sure to no leave you gaming system or or any other channel that has still images. I have notices that images have temporarily burnt through but I think samsung has some kind of technology on this system that helps to quickly remove the images from the TV in a matter of minutes. But dont worry as of today I still do not have any permannt burnt images to my TV (and I have accidentally left a lot of things on that I should have). Perhaps the greatest thing I love about this TV is that I was questioning whether or not I should buy this plasma over an LCD.  Recently I have also bought an LCD that was 1080 from LG and I honeslty do not feel that it comes out as colorful and it has a limited viewing angle.  On this TV you can view it from any angle, but on my LG 42" LCD it looks fantastic (yes, and crisper than this tv) but it if I am not staring directly at it it fades white depending how far off I view the tv from the angle.  So for a living room, I would suggest the Plasma.  For a bedroom I would suggest the LCD (which is breathtaking in its own right for different reasons).This tv has many optional components such as hooking up your videogames systems to the HDMI port which makes videogames really come to life.  Even my intel wireless display seems look better on this tv even though I am using a brand new computer that I purchased from amazon as well.  It also has a vga output for all of you who cannot connect thier computer with hdmi or intel wireless so that you can watch televison programing through the internet (internet tv is a million times better; in fact I am thinking about getting rid of my cable bill!)  So basically I am really happy about the purchase.  I do have two of the same tv in different sizes and an LCD tv by LG so it made it easier for me to compare. I hope this will help you guys out with making your decision!  If you want to know more about the LG LCD 42" please be sure to check back later as I plan to write a review for this product as well.

Make sure you have the right woofer specsor you're gonna cook your woofer this subwoofer speaker cable supports high current (literally) throughput.Cons: NONE (Not necessarily a con, but it is quite thick, you may have to trim some excess wire to fit connection(s)I definitely recommend this product to all who need high quality subwoofer cable for systems under 1000Wbut if you're going big you'd be better off with lower gauge higher current supporting thicker wire cable instead.

$review_text.: Battery works well with my Canon SD4500. It lasts longer than the original. I haven't timed anything, but I'd say it lasts about twice as long, or nearly. This is very nice, since the original battery didn't last long at all. It's also not great, since lasting longer than the original battery is no great feat.I keep the original battery fully charged and in the camera case as back-up. This works out pretty well, and almost makes up for the fact that Canon somehow managed to create a battery that barely lives up to it's appointed task.UPDATE: In less than a year, maybe 8 months, the battery started to hold very little charge and would only last for maybe 50 photos or 20-30 minutes of video recording. But at it's current price ($8) I'd say it's still worth it. You could get a couple for backups. I had bought it for around $20 I think, and I can't say it was worth it.

$review_text.: It's bright, does what it's intended to do, and doesn't overheat. This extends a good 40 ft for lighting. The filters don't do much. The clear/off white filter does very little to add softness; the pink is almost completely unnoticeable; however, the sepia isn't half bad.Besides the filters, only other complaint is the battery life indicator ...it's not a battery life indicator. Basically it tells you what level brightness you have your light turned up to. With brand new batteries, light turned up all the way, the indicator will show one red light. I don't know if maybe this means an hr lifespan at this light level? When dimmed down to about a quarter of it's brightness, all four red lights will light up. - Same batteries, right after full brightness test. Half dimmed, 2 red lights.For the price and brightness, you can't beat it. Filters and battery life indicator aside, good product with a fairly firm build. Bottom parts seem to be made of a cheap plastic, but screws hold very tight and the parts are short enough that I don't think they're in danger of breaking unless you really try. I've tested it in multiple positions and it's held up great thus far.

 Since there is no optical drive, I recommend downloading Open Office to work on your Office docs
 Firefox is also the faster browser on this machine than IE.The pros --Good keyboard except for the right shift key as noted by others
 Once you get used to it, it's acceptable.-XP operating system makes it easy to use.-Lots of USB ports.-Good internet connectivity.-Screen is very bright.-Excellent portability, I no longer lug around a 15" laptop when this can do the job.-Fast enough with the Intel Atom

 The Celeron is slower with lower battery life.-Seems well built and thought out.-Great battery life but not quite 7 hours as ad says.-Doesn't scrimp on ports, ram, hard disk


With other companies, these are expensive extras.-Instructions divulge honesty about laptop batteries - first time a pc company said not to buy batteries if you are not going to use them since they do not store well


 I liked that.Cons and these are minor:- Not sure why the hard drive is partitioned in two.- Price bumps up against low end Vista laptops but this is a speciality item.Overall, I love it.

$REVIEW.: I was skeptical when ordering this product.  I had never before heard of TP-Link.  Because this router is available for less than $70, I had real reservations on just how well it would do in a real working environment.I was pleasantly surprised to find out from a performance standpoint, there was not much difference from the "big names."  After EASY set-up, I began using the router in my small insurance agency.  I didn't tell my Office Manager I had changed routers.  I waited for her reaction.  She never even noticed the difference between the TP-Link N600 and our previous Netgear WNDR4500 which, incidentally, was double the price.The wireless performance of the N600 router turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Even though the router is less than half the cost of some of the "big name" routers, there is no lacking of performance whatsoever.  You may not like the look of a router with its external antennas, but there is no doubt the router utilizes the design effectively.  The speed is outstanding and the range is exceptional.All in all, TP-Link N600 comes equipped with ALMOST every major function you could want from a router.  It is MISSING a 'Guest Network' feature which allows you to have separate security and access restrictions for guests accessing your network.  Other than that, I believe this router can certainly compete with the "big names."Adding to my satisfaction, the TP-Link N600 comes complete with a 2-year limited warranty.The TP-Link N600 is a very impressive dual-band router that performs like the "big names" but costs about half the price.  It doesn't have the most attractive interface, but it isn't lacking many features.  Those looking for a best buy for the money, the TP-Link N600 is really hard to beat.

$REVIEW.: When my older HP Pavilion laptop with 17" screen starting giving me trouble, I started looking for its replacement.  (It no longer recognized DVDs, quit communicating with the printer, and just really started to make me angry. Too many nights working on it trying to get it to do the basics.)  Granted the HP was maxed out with the most awesome of bling factor, TV tuner card, 2 remotes, lightscribe, everything you could ever need in a laptop or a desktop for that matter.  So when I started to look, I knew what I used and what was really important to me.  Since I work on a 15" screen at work, I knew I wanted a really big monitor, yet did not want a desktop. Portability was very important, but weight was not. Though I do sit on the couch with my computer alot, it was still not as heavy as my lap dog who weighs 65 lbs!  I can say that the computer doesn't run hot at all, even when sitting on my lap.  The fan is also surprisingly quiet.  Keep in mind the battery life is short.  Thankfully, I have alot of outlets around!I wasn't really sure about Windows 7, seeing as I was upgrading from Windows XP.  However, I really like it, especially the new functions in Windows Media Center.  This software is user friendly and has a bunch of neat features for everyone.One of the reviewers complained about fingerprints.  This computer does show fingerprints. Its an issue, but almost all laptops have it. But, I have to say that I absolutely love the feel of the keys compared to all the other laptops (4) that I own.  The size of the keys are very well sized.  I have small hands, but I believe these keys would accomodate most people.  Plus, they are silky smooth to touch.One of the more important features for me was technology similar to Lightscribe.  Toshiba uses Labelflash which is similar.  This allow you to create DVDs and CDs with labels that are actually printed on the disc itself, not on a paper label.  Although I have yet to actually burn one,  software seems relatively easy to use.  Labelflash discs aren't readily available at my local Wal-Mart, so keep that in mind before you start working on a project.All in all,  I am very highly pleased with this computer, especially at its very reasonable price.  It is doing the most important things on my checklist and more and more!  BTW, some reviewers commented that finding a case was hard.  Please note that I found a nice case on [...] for a very reasonable price, with no tax and free shipping.  I got a case for my computer and Flip Ultra HD for about $50.00.  Bargain!
$review_summary.: Wonderful, big computer with alot of nice features!

$review_text.: This camera worked well after six months, but in the past week, after the camera opened, it stayed open and beeped, saying "Lens error, restart camera."  Google this term and the Canon 1100IS and you'll see many people with the same problem.A shame since I've bought numerous Canon cameras over the years and have found them to work flawlessly.  There's even a class-action suit over this to get them to acknowledge the problem with the 1100IS.  Google that and you'll find info on that too.UPDATE:  I've read accounts of owners who send Canon the camera in for servicing within the warranty period and for their troubles are told that it's their fault instead of a production flaw.  I sent in mine prepared for the worst, but they ended up fixing it!  So in my case, they honored the warranty. I'd give the product 3 stars now, but Amazon doesn't let you change the original rating.

I have been installing my own car stereos for years. I was shopping for a In-dash DVD player with HD Radio and discovered this deal on amazon.com  One of the best feature is the HD radio, Finally I can listen to music without annoying commercials and stupid discussions played on normal FM. The sound quality is great and the deck looks beautiful not to mention the best deal here on amazon. There's a few flaws this unit has. One is the small size of the clock display, I wish that it would be bigger. Another flaw is when in aux mode you are stuck with a gray screen with the time and "av1" displayed in the corner. It has an RCA video input but useless without the RCA audio input, this limit the expandability of unit like adding a game console but you can't hear it.

$review_text.: Let me say up front that I am usually a fan of Belkin products
I have found the majority of their products to be, by and large, a good value


This one is not
The case has a rather unfinished feel to it and the construction is stiff and flimsy feeling


The plastic corners cover the parts of the Ipad 3 as they are supposed to
The rest of my $600 device is basically left exposed and ready to sustain major damage if it falls while open (granted that it could happen with many other open cases) to the sides left exposed
The fold over and around options are hampered by the overall awkward build for the case
The seams don't match up precisely and repeatedly as they should, and the fastener never seems to be in the right place without fiddling with it
So - overall, a 5 or a 6 because it has a nice look from across the room and the magnetic closers work


NOW - a word on a really crappy return policy move brought to you by Belkin and Amazon - I have owned this case for three days and wish to return it because it is not up to my standards and if I had purchased at a brick and mortar store, my money would be returned to me IN FULL - NO QUESTIONS ASKED


But Amazon and Belikin wish to charge me $9.32 less than the price I paid (31 bucks) because the "cause of the return was not their fault."  Really? How about the "cause of the return" is because I am dissatisfied with the product and am wholly DISSATISFIED with the product's description and assertion of its quality

So - two stars off for that and I will leave one star there

Good luck, fellow Amazonians, and caveat emptor on this whole mess of a transaction - with so many choices available, pass on this one


 Maybe the REAL LESSON is to shop for these in person and bite the bullet and buy it locally when you find one that looks and works great - in your hands right in front of you!

$REVIEW.: Recently, I took 28 hours to back up 600GB via a USB interface.  Never again.  I specifically chose this Anker device because I have already purchasedAnker Uspeed USB 3.0 PCI-E Express Card with 4 USB 3.0 Ports and 5V 4-Pin Power Connector for Desktops [VL805 Chipset]andAnker USB 3.0 & eSATA Hard Drive Enclosure for 2.5-Inch SATA 9.5mm & 12.5mm HDD and SSD, which are both top notch products.This unit does not disappoint.  It is incredibly small, with a dual power and data plug for the external drive.  The USB3 cable is included.  The power supply is a plug-brick (not a surprise,  it is in the 4th picture) and I like it more than the cord-brick-cord type power supply most dongles like this use.  Did I mention FAST?  I have two PCs with eSATA plugs, but I always worry because if you look at them cross-eyed, they will unplug from the PC.As another reviewer mentioned, I first plug in the hard drive, then the power, wait for the drive to rev up to speed (at least the mechanical ones), and then plug in the USB3 cable to the PC.  I don't know if this is necessary, but it 'seemed like the proper way' (A Dune quote for you fans).

$REVIEW.: OK I admit it, I am leery of Linksys wireless routers.  I have had four routers in my life (the E4200 being the fifth) and only the Linksys router gave me headaches.  I vowed to never get another Linksys in my life, but I like Cisco so this was a dilemna and so far I am have been happy with it.DesignThis is a very slick device.  I love the low profile that lets it hide on top of the cabinet it is on.  A nice looking piece of hardware.SetupI have never had an easier set up on any wireless router.  I installed the software onto my MacBook (mac friendly) and it self-discovered and prompted for the rest of the set up.  Very nice setup, although a little long from beginning to end (7 minutes or so.)  I loved that it prompted to personalize the SSID and password right up front.  Software was slick and straight forward.  Once set up I had all 7 wireless devices in the house on-line in about 20 minutes. Even my wireless printer worked instantly. - Five stars on Set-upFunctionalityI have only had the device installed for a weekend now, but I spent that time backing up my hard drive to a wireless SAN, watching streaming netflix and uploading a new website.  No hiccups at all.  About the only thing I did have an issue with is trying to set it up with my Ooma.  I needed to rebooted the router and modem after removing the Ooma.  No blame here, the Ooma doesn't seem to want to play nicely with any router or cable modem.I really like the ability to have a guest network.  It is easily turned off and on so I can easily provide a connection to visitors, but turn it off and totally deny the Brazilian students next door (actually it is password protected so it is not wide open, but less secure.)SpeedI may not be the best to judge speed.  I am not the type to watch the throughput numbers, but I can say that netflix streamed Mars Attacks wirelessly to my Wii without any issues. I have no issues with the speed at all.ConclusionI am very happy with the router.  Who knows, two years down the line, I may be able to let my prejudice against Linksys go.  If things continue to go well, or if they take a turn for the worse, I will update this review.

$review_text.: Over several months, I'd started to notice an increase in multiple, intermittent, short DSL outages. I bought this modem at about 1/3rd the price of the DSL carrier's replacement modem so I could check to see whether I had a problem with the signal coming onto the property or with the old modem.  I've had no interruptions since installing this modem.Installation was fairly straightforward and simple.  The hardest part was retrieving my password from the DSL carrier, as their original modem retrieved that information automatically during setup, and I had never had a need to log on.  Once that was accomplished, I simply provided the login information to this modem and was up and running with via cable to my desktop.The only real wrinkle I had was that my router didn't automatically pick up the DSL account password from the modem once I connected the router.  I manually supplied the log-in information to my router, the rest of the setup was a breeze.One tidbit I picked up during this process is that possibly my old modem was OK and that the power supply was overheating and failing intermittently before cooling and start to work again.However, for less than $30 for a brand new modem that works, I'm totally happy.

$REVIEW.: I got my S50 for Christmas.  It's a fun product, but still has some kinks to be worked out.  The first night I tried to schedule recording of music channels.  It didn't work and so I called Sirius customer support.  The first person I spoke to there said that you couldn't schedule recording of music channels.  Turns out that is not true, and after talking to a supervisor, I got the right combination of settings to get music to record.  (Among other things you have to be on a specific version of firmware).  Now I've managed to successfully record several hours of Christmas music, dance music, classical music.**UPDATED 1/2006*After testing the S50 for 30 days I decided to return it.  The recorded sound quality from the satellite radio was very disappointing, and based on my research this is an artifact of the compression that Sirius uses. The FM modulator sounds like all FM modulators, a little tinny.  The direct line out jack has much better sound, but still not fantastic.The program to manage your music collection is acceptable, but not great.  The memory (512M) available for your own MP3 collection is really small given how big the unit is.  It doesn't come close to standing up to an IPOD, Creative Zen or Iriver MP3 player.If you're using this primarily for music, there are better options.  You can buy a 20G MP3 player + an XM Roady2 + Timetrax and (a) save $100-200, (b) get better sound quality (c) have 40X as much memory for your own MP3's.If you're interested in timeshifting Howard Stern or other Sirius-only programming, this may be a good solution for you.Some other notes:If you have an S50 and cannot find the home docking station, go out to radio shack and buy an AC-to-DC Portable Power Supply (P/N 22-505) for $26.99.  I've been using my S50 with that and it works just great on my home stereo.

$REVIEW.: Can't write anything bad about this product:- Great quality- The broad neck-part of the strap takes away weight- Sticks better on your shoulder than the standard oneThe reason why I didn't buy this product again for my second SLR but a thinner (and cheaper) version: It takes more place in your bag and can be annoying when storing the SLR. The standard one easily folds in any bag compartment, but this thing is definitely "there". It is like a thick, broad, foam-ish thing is attached to your camera. Also when you walk around with your cam in your hand you always have like a big foam-plate swinging around - can be a little bit annoying.

$REVIEW.: This is good at cooling my HP Pavilion DV6 15.6 computer which was always running very hot if left on a flat hard surface. I like the tilt-level and that it's made from aluminum.  Moving the thin profile fans is literally a snap -- I choose the two fan model, although there is a version that includes 3 fans. Two fan seems perfect for 15&#34; computer or smaller -- probably need three fans for 17&#34; computers.  Not certain this base would handle a 17&#34; laptop.  It's perfect for a 15&#34; for sure.  I especially like the USB connector cable which has a pass-thru design, so you don't really give up a USB port -- you can just piggy back onto it. The fans are quiet but don't expect gale force winds -- the air movement is plenty to do the job.  For the price, performance and design I'd give it a high recommendation -- Well done Cooler Master - Well done !

$review_text.: (I have the 1.5TB ST31500341AS, firmware CC1H)I really loved this drive up until about 6PM last night. I use it to hold my media, and I've never had any issues with performance - I can wirelessly stream HD video from this HDD in my office PC to my home theater PC without any hiccups.And then last night, as I was working (and not using that drive for anything intensive, I might add), I started getting terrifying messages from my HDD monitor software AND from Windows - the reallocated sector count was suddenly through the roof, and this drive was ready to die.I checked the logs on my hard drive monitoring software, and between 6:00PM and 7:00PM, the "health" of the reallocated sector count had nose-dived from 100% to 12%. About 24 hours later, it's at 2%...Apparently I'm not the only one with the issue - after doing some browsing and troubleshooting, I found that this was a common enough problem with this model, and Seagate gave me an RMA number without even being asked (their recovery software popped up with a "Warranty Code" after it told me it couldn't solve the problem).That was disappointing, and I'm still not sure how it happened so quickly. The drive's under 1 year old, and there wasn't any physical reason for its reliability to suddenly tank (no jarring of the desktop tower, drive temperature wasn't too bad, etc).So why am I still giving it 3 stars?1. S.M.A.R.T is a really nice feauture; there's nothing worse than instant hard drive death with no warning at all. At least I can still salvage anything valuable from this drive before it's completely broken.2. Seagate's customer support rep was fantastic. I asked her if it was possible to get a replacement drive BEFORE returning this one (so I don't have to juggle 1.5TB of data in the meantime), and she was able to give me a free "priority return", which essentially means that I'll get my replacement drive in the next 5 days, with a box and prepaid packing slip I can use to return the defective drive. Usually this costs $9.99, but she waived the fee since they couldn't guarantee 2-day delivery.My experience might not be typical, but so far it hasn't been that bad. Sure, it's been inconvenient, but compared to my last HDD failure in 2005, this was a cakewalk.

$REVIEW.: ProsGreat packaging.Easy to apply.Doesn't leave residue from the application liquidDries quick (took about 2 hours for the liquid application to dry out)StrongMinor scratches will "heal" by them self over time.Protects (Dropped my tablet on cement, made some dings on the screen protector but it eventually faded away)Awesome little squeegee thing to remove the liquid application from underneath the screen protectorCons:NoneI've applied many screen protectors on my gadgets and this is one of the best ones I've ever had the chance to work with

It took me on try to apply the screen protector using the liquid application water thing provide in the packaging


Just spray some on the device (powered off), spray some on your finger tips, peel away the screen protector from the film and just apply onto the screen


Move it around to get a perfect fit and remove any excess liquid underneath the screen protector and bubbles by using the squeegee provided
Let it sit for a few hours so it will dry underneath the screen protector and it's that simple.

$SUMMARY.: Perfect

$REVIEW.: I had a number of volumes to bind as a result of  my wife's genealogy studies.  After considerable thought we decided the comb binding would work well and that we would prefer to do it ourselves since we anticipated considerably more binding requirements in the future.  I ordered the Pulsar Plus 300 and received it quite promptly.  I looked it over and was pleased with the quality and features but I realized that the books my wife was making would be too large for this binder.  It is limited to 1 1/2&#34; combs.  Printed double sided her book was 350 pages on 24# paper and required a 2&#34; comb.  I therefore returned Pulsar 300 and ordered the Quasar 500 which accepts 2&#34; combs.  This is not a reflection on the quality of either machine - I just needed one with a larger capacity.The Pulsar 300 machine will work wonderfully well for those that don't need to use combs larger than 1 1/2 inches.I received the Quasar 500 quite promptly and immediately did a sample of some150 pages on 20# paper.  Punching took little effort for up to 15 pages or so.  Good clean punches were obtained with 20 pages as advertised but the effort was noticeably greater.  The books I bought this machine to bind are on 24# paper.  The 24# paper punches cleanly as indicated above for the 20# paper.I have now used combs up to 2&#34; with good results.  It just takes a little patience and attention to detail so you don't punch crookedly or miss getting a page on some of the prongs at the edge.  That being said the process is simple and yields a great result.  When you are punching, checking that the paper is parallel to the upper part of the open lid gives you a double check on alignment.Bottom line is that I like this binder.  The quality is good, it punches cleanly, and it is easy to spread the combs and fit the pages.The instructions are inadequate, however, operation is simple enough that you should be able to figure it out fairly quickly.  Just load the combs behind the steel prongs with the comb teeth toward you and facing up.  Then use the small spreading lever on the left to spread the comb.  As you load paper on the comb with the larger sizes such as the 1 1/2 and 2&#34; combs you may need to retract the spreading lever partially and pull up the comb teeth to make it easier to fit the paper.If you have reports, proposals, books and papers you need to organize and bind, the Quasar 500 is a great choice - particularly if you nee to bind books up to 2&#34; thick!  I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: This antenna works well as an outdoor antenna.  But (like every other design I've tested) it has no advantage over plain old rabbit ears when used indoors.  It did not improve signal loss, and did not even get as many channels as the rabbit ears until it was placed outside.

Then you can't close(has to fully open first) it leaving built in partially deployed and camera confused which flash to use.

$review_text.: Brought this for my HP DV2911 laptop to use in the office.  It is connected to an external scanner, printer, network cable, mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, and external hardisk.  Worked perfectly from day one just like my old IBM and Toshiba docking stations.  I now come to the office, take out my laptop and plug in one cable, hit the power button and I'm working.  A nice bonus feature is I can use both the external monitor and laptop monitor together when I need to compare or edit 2 documents.  Nice!The unit doesn't come with a power supply, but it is also about 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a full docking station.  I had to buy another power supply for home use.  Also, I don't know if this is fully compatible with non HP laptops, but if you have an HP laptop, this is great.

$review_text.: I listened to AM radio streams on my previous iPhone simply through the iPhone's speakers while it sat on my Apple charging block.  When I upgraded and needed to replace all my old charging accessories with lightning versions, I decided to find a small speaker dock.What I expected here from the pictures was a base not much bigger than the iPhone itself, not a lot bigger than a regular iPhone charging stand.  Measuring at more like 7" wide by 6" deep and about 2.5" tall, it's WAY bigger than that.  Definitely not the space saver I was hoping for.  The iPhone looks sort of ridiculous seated on it.  Not exactly the elegant solution one's looking for with an elegant looking phone, but not all that out of place among the matching bulky black office equipment (laptop, dock, monitor, peripherals) that surround it.Sound quality from the unit is fine, a much fuller experience than the phone's speakers (which aren't really designed for listening to radio or music), though the volume level with each tap of the button is more like jarring than a smooth flow.  One tap can go from 'not loud enough' to 'too loud'.  You can control the volume from the toggle on the unit, from the phone's volume keys, or from the volume level on the app itself.  The on-screen app volume slider seems to be the most forgiving, though even there I think it pops back to the next pre-defined "step" after you let go.If you have your phone in the dock and shut the JBL's power off, the program/song pauses automatically.  But when restarting the program again (which doesn't happen when hit the power button...you have to push Play on the screen after turning the dock on again), the volume comes out at a blaring loud preset regardless of the slider level on the screen.  Not good at the office, and I have yet to figure out a way to start the unit without having to quickly pop the volume down.Apple has a history of making beautiful, sensible products.  Somebody in the speaker dock industry seriously needs to learn from that and go forward because, so far, none of them are doing it right.  Not even close.

$review_text.: This is my review of non Red version, but it is the same. Red version is even better for those who like the color!There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! First, if you have not had any tablets before, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 7&#34;. It is ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7&#34; Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7&#34; form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8&#34;. In my opinion 8&#34; is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8&#34; a 5 star. I gave 7&#34; a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10&#34; also a 4 star because of some strange spec `limitations'.Samsung has introduced 7&#34;, 8&#34; and 10.1&#34; of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10&#34; lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10&#34; Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 2 model.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 oz. (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.9 oz. (309 grams) Android 4.210.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz. (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 7&#34; has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs only 300 gm. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.Galaxy Tab 2 is 345 grams, so Tab 3 is lighter by 45 grams.  Processors are similar 1.2 GHz dual core in Tab 3 Vs 1 GHz dual core in Tab 2. Resolutions are same with Tab 2 1024 x 600 pixels (~170 ppi pixel density). Tab 3 supports up to 64 GB whereas Tab2 is 32 GB. Not a big deal unless you have tons of video/photo/ebooks/music you want to carry with you all the time. I use a mixture of on device storage + Google Music + box for my data needs.  Battery is also same between Tab 2 and Tab 3 7&#34; versions - Non-removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery.Both have Bluetooth 3.0.  I cannot confirm still if Tab 3 7&#34; supports OTG.  I know for sure Tab 3 8&#34; supports as I tested it.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7&#34; does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. 7&#34; is equally capable as a 8in for `most' day to day apps. If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos 7&#34; is more than enough. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10&#34;, 12&#34; 13&#34;, 15, 17 and even some 19&#34; if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate.

$review_text.: I bought the transmitter & receiver so I could use a more expensive headset, not wireless, that also keeps out background noise


So I let these TaoTronics things charge for 5hrs.Putting the transmitter & receiver in sync mode did work and initially I thought it was worth it because the stuff was fine

Well it worked fine while I was watching tv until I got maybe 15 ft away behind two walls, in the bedroom bathroom

Audio was fine for about 30 seconds but then the signal is lost


Even when I get out of the bathroom the device does not automatically start the signal

After I turn off / turn on the devices they connect and audio starts....digital radio frequency is best for longer distances>> UPDATE &lt;&lt;I went back to my cellphone/bluetooth for a specific set of earbuds that blockout background noise and got frustrated with the audio delay
I tried putting the the transmitter hanging again, similar to before but this time it is not near in the center of the room it is closer to a wall on the center of one the extreme edges of my apartment

Maybe this is making the signal broadcast better because I do not have problems now

The audio of this bluetooth is not out of sync with the video..

when I used my phone for watching things on my computer via the vlc app I had to adjust the audio/video with audio hastened about .200Only complaint I have is I cannot adjust the volume.

$review_text.: This little DVD player works really well for my 2.5 year old on long car trips.Pro: works fine, satisfactory picture even at an angle, no bulky external battery, plays for 4 hours on battery, it can read CDs that my previous, more expensive portable DVD player could not read for some reasons.Cons: does not come with a plug for the car, does not have a menu button! (I turn it on/off to go back to menu or keep fast-forwarding), it's very slow to start. It doesn't work with the toddler headsets I have.I am satisfied with it just because it works fine and was a great value, the previous more expensive model I had kept stopping and I had to hit it for it to restart every few minutes, I don't remember the brand/model, so as long as my toddler can watch her cartoons uninterrupted while I'm driving, I'm satisfied.

 No need for the screen

 Take a few minutes and learn how to customize the button to fit your equipment and you will likely not need anything else


 Love that I can use my iPhone when needed but the remote is excellent all by itself


 I was able to get it setup to operate my PS3 (used primarily as a media player)

 So simply my 3 year old can turn on the PS3 and go to her movie folder and turn on an Elmo video
 My wife also loves it

 Her whole thing with technology is please keep it simply


 No training necessary she figured it out without any help

 This is also a learning remote

 Our DVR has a skip feature that was not not assigned to a key was the DVR was added in the setup process

 I was able to pull out the old remote and assign the skip feature to one of the special keys
 I am getting 2 more of these so we have the same remote on all devices in the house.

$review_text.: I couldn't get the WPS button to work, which confirms a suspicion that I have about problems with the WPS function on my router (couldn't get it to work with a different device a few months ago).  I was disappointed that I couldn't just use the two-button setup and frustrated that I was going to have to find a power outlet close to an open Ethernet cable (it seems to be either one or the other in my house, because all the power outlets are already taken).  But I was THRILLED to find that they have a wireless setup too.  I've used two similar wireless extenders before, but they both required wired Ethernet.So I used the wireless method and it took me about four minutes to set this up.  It found my network right away and all I had to do was enter my password.  It linked up and kicked me off the admin page (because it's network name changed as part of the setup).  Then I unplugged it and took it upstairs to put it in its new home.One nice feature that this device has is a signal strength indicator.  That's a first for me.  I got four bars out of five upstairs, which is perfect for my applications.  Now all my portable devices get great network connections upstairs.  I even have a good strong signal in the front and back yards now.Great product.  Simple setup.  Very well done.

$REVIEW.: These are very good sounding in-ear headphones for the price. The hype is justified. However, I can't rate these 5 stars because of two issues. The first is that the rubber material used for the cables keeps tugging on clothing and causes the plugs to be yanked out of my ears all the time. Lame. They could have used a better material. The second issue is that the rubber/silicone plugs just dont hang tight in my ears. This will be different from person to person. Since all three included sizes don't fit me quite right I have to take a star off. Your mileage may vary.
$SUMMARY.: Your results may vary - Good overall

I got it so I could toss it in my fitness backpack that I wear when mountain biking.

This case fits the bill for all of those purposes!

$review_text.: Pro:- Great sound. I am sure there are higher quality headphones made by Monster, but compared to other companies that make headphones in this price range (that I have tried) these are hands down the best- Rubber earplugs stay on! I have gone through pair after pair that kept loosing those damn little rubber plug thingys. It drives me insane. These ones stay on even though I am constantly pulling them in and out of my pocket- Great Cables that are thin and don't snag / stick to everything they tough. I have used others where I felt like if they even got close to something just seemed to stick and pull them out of my ears. These are thing, smooth and durable- Work for Phone Calls. I use mine on my Android phone everyday. They are not specifically designed for it, or call it out in the specs I have noticed. Microphone works great, better than others that spec they are phone capable.- Great Customer Service. They offered to replace my pair that I broke without a problem. And honestly, I broke them by running past something and they snagged. It wasn't a question of the cables being weak.Cons:- Phone calls are great as I said, only odd thing is every now and then on a random phone call, I get these occasional noises that cut through. It is random and doesn't happen often, but I would say it happens on 1 out of 50 calls, maybe 1 out of 100- Weight: I do have to say these do weigh a bit more in your ear. But, its still 100% comfortable. And because it is designed well, they don't fall out any more often than other brands I have tried.Overall:I highly recommend these headphones. I wouldn't let the con's I listed leave a bad taste in your mouth. For the price they are awesome and I love them. You will be very happy with these, and they will out last other pairs. With the added benefit saving extra cash in the long run because you don't have to buy new rubber pieces (like you do with other brands).

I really got the AppleTV so I can control what movies my child watches by ripping certain movies onto the AppleTV for her, then she can pick and choose on her own.The good thing about AppleTV is that it allows you to organize and watch your movies like you have video on demand
The bad thing is that there is no playlist support for movie organization, just one big long list.There are a few more bad thing about it that really stands out


It sits there hot even on standby
It is slow - takes forever to start any kind of HD download


The HD only supports maximum data rate of 5 Mbps H.264, better than DVD but not as good as OTA HD or Blu-ray

The SD trailers look terrible.It definitely deserves its "hobby" status.

$review_text.: While I am relatively new to RAVPower products, I'm learning quickly and what it is that I'm learning is that they make not only a wide variety of products, but everything that I've seen have been really GREAT, too.I love having as much power to my cell phone as possible--all the time
With my particular job, I am away from power outlets rather frequently, and my particular form of OCD gets me nervous if my phone battery gets below 80% (yeah, I know it doesn't make sense, but all I can say is I honestly get weirded out by that, and I know I shouldn't)
I used to have a smaller power pack that worked great, but was MUCH bigger and only about 4400mAh

With this smaller, and more powerful battery pack, its the best of both worlds


Portability AND a great deal of power--especially when I need it.As with my RAVPower wireless charging pad, the ease of use is ridiculously simple

It comes with a variety of charging ports which will fit a large number of devices, bluetooth sets, phones etc
but certainly not all of them
Thankfully, most cell phones (sans Apple) have converted to the micro USB charging port, and that's all I use

It also comes with two cords, one which charges the battery fast, and one at a nominal rate
Its simple to hook up and charge via the wall, and just as simple to plug into your phone and give it all the juice it needs.While I'm not exactly certain when the built-in flashlight will come in handy, I'm sure that one day it will


For the time being, however, I don't really use it much, if at all

I understand that others may use it regularly, which could also explain why it comes standard to begin with


Either way, its an interesting addition to the device.I think that's really all I have to say, other than not only am I impressed with its ease of use, convenience and power supply, but also how small it really is
5600mAh in something this small? I can carry it AND my phone in my pocket without hardly noticing it
Honestly, that is a great feature and one I found worthy of noting here.If you're looking, I say grab a RAVPower device and enjoy it while saving money at the same time

You'll be glad you did.

It has amazing macro and very functional night time prime


Made for crop frame body
If you are looking for a macro for objects then you are looking at the right lens


Gets extremely sharp around mid F values
Built tough
I would use it at Limit mode except for macro as it focuses faster


White balance you would need to adjust a little bit cause it's sharpness cuts in the way


Does not soften it out


Best camera mode manual

Please note the front elements stretches a lot during focus, so if you are too close you may actually hit the subject
It focuses very close from subject.

I used it with a WDTV Live to stream video, as well as with WD2Go apps on my ios devices


The included backup software was miserable and brought my systems to a crawl while it ran so had to uninstall.The activity light on the front of the unit died after about eight months, but the drive still functioned so I ignored it

The drive stopped being recognized on the network today - one year and two weeks after purchase - and cannot be restored

It is likely I can remove the hard drive to recover data but haven't tried yet.This is becoming commonplace - where hardware is being designed to last about the length of the warranty and not much more.I have a hard time looking at a warranty as an expiration date on the products I buy, but like many others this has become one of them.:'(

$REVIEW.: If you go into any Apple Store you'll see dozens of cases for the iPod Touch. But none of them cost less than $30. And over a short period of time, these cases crack in certain spots...rendering them useless. So I figured the key would be to find a very inexpensive case, and buy several of them. I absolutely LOVE this case. It's a 'snap-on' style, meaning the iPod Touch is sandwiched between two separate pieces. The risk, of course, is that these pieces don't 'snap together' as well as they should, so that was my first litmus test. But they fit just fine, and have ever since. Now, the color is red and there's nothing particularly 'sexy' about the design; it is what it is. But still, it's a good-looking product and it serves the purpose admirably.

$REVIEW.: OK, I'm not the biggest fan of screen protectors
They're hard to install, get bubbles, smudges, and, and, and..

But, I also really hate finger smudges when I'm trying to watch a movie


Since I had purchased other Anker products with great success and these screen protectors claimed to be smudge resistant, I decided to give them a try.And WOW, it worked

No smudges, well once in a while when eating chips


In the past, the only protectors that I had seen with any level of smudge protection were matte and this protector is crystal clear
Great for games and video.Now to the other bits


The kit comes with two protectors, a lint removal cloth, a nifty little tool to get any last little bits remaining,and a little tool to move any bubbles to the side

It took me a couple of attempts to get it on correctly, but when I finished, it looked like a factory item


Fit an form are spot on, with no trimming or fiddling to get the protector to fit.Bottom line, they work and with little or no finger smudges

Haven't dropped anything on the screen, but the protector is sturdy enough to keep keys, or any similar item from scratching the screen


And the second protector is a nice touch, if the original is scratched you already have a spare


If you're looking for a protector, this is the one to try.

I've managed to put my Nikon D3200 with the kit 18-55mm zoom, 55-200mm tele-zoom lens, and a 35mm prime lens, all with the lens hoods reversed. There are usable pockets on both ends to put extra batteries and chargers. There is another nice size pocket on the outside of the bag, just under the flip-over top cover. Inside of that pocket is a zip-up mesh pocket. Finally, there is zip pocket on the back side of the bag, and the pocket on the front flip-over cover that you can see in the picture. Both of these are not very deep, used for documents, covers, maybe filters, etc.I have no complaints about the quality of the materials, construction or workmanship, and it's good looking! This is not a professional camera bag, and I use it as a occasional photographer, to store my equipment, and carry in my car. This is a high value camera case. You would expect to pay more for something as good as this. I highly recommend this camera case!

$review_text.: Like every preceding Roxio Toast program, this one  captures your attention with its colorful graphics.  If only it were as successful in capturing audio files and video images!There is very little that Roxio does that can't be done by using the programs--Tunes, iDVD, iMovie, iPhoto, Disk Utility--included with purchase of a Mac computer.  Although Apple's programs and applications are comparatively accessible and user-friendly, Toast showcases them in a way that makes them seem more "instant," if not automatic.  Unfortunately the Toast "short-cuts" end up being more of a hassle than a time-saver, and I end up burning my CDs in iTunes and downloading external software for editing video (or simply turn the project over to a "dedicated" VHS to DVD conversion machine--which can often be purchased for twice the price of the Toast program).My biggest disappointment with Toast for the past several editions has been the Spin Doctor program, which is bundled in every edition apparently  unchanged from preceding editions. I've tried numerous times to record sound from my computer via Toast's included electronic "patch cord," alleged to link your computer's audio output with its audio input (especially critical now that Apple has eliminated the "Audio In" port from the new iMacs).  Just as often, I've given up on this undependable, erratic feature, and removed it from my machine (even though it refuses to be deleted from my machine's library).More seriously, the audio wave forms, which are so important for accurate, precise (and undetectable) editing aren't up to the task.  As colorful as the automatically extracted tracks from an LP are, they're never sufficiently precise to replace a good $20 dollar wave editing program.  If I wish to digitize an LP, delete or insert a 12-bar chorus of an improvised solo (without missing a beat), or set up a timed recording of an FM broadcast, I'm much more likely to realize quick and effective results by downloading a program like Sound Studio (or free software like Audacity).Toast has the cosmetics down.  If they would address functionality in the next edition, beginning with Spin Doctor, offering a USB interface (equal to iMic's or  Behringer's along with wave forms that can be easily read and precisely edited), the program could prove a pleasure to use--and a practical tool.  (Adding a timer can't be a big challenge, especially when it comes free with apps like "TuneIn.")

$review_text.: the shock mount is made of sturdy metal, the pop filter is made with two layers of cloth with an air space between them

 The filter support telescopes, you can adjust the length and the angle on each end
 All the parts are metal so you can crank down hard on the knobs and not break anything


 The elastic is stiff enough there is not much sag in any mounting direction


 The microphone attaches to a captive treaded ring nut

 The whole thing mounts with either standard American microphone stand threads or the smaller European type threads

 I tried kicking the stand with the microphone live and yes it reduces the noise greatly but of course not 100%

 I thought the price was a little to high but when you consider you get a quality pop filer that is a no-brainer to mount and adjust and remains "put in place" the price is reasonable.This is NOT a general propose generic shock mount

 It is designed for only a few Rode model microphones with threads on the bottom that fit the threaded ring nut.


$SUMMARY.: This is very well built, all metal.

$REVIEW.: I received these as a gift and have been very satisfied with them


 The sound is clean and clear and they just look cool

 I have had them for three years now and have had zero problems with them even moving them to and from college.The system does have a few quirks.-No power switch

 I thought this was odd, but for what ever reason Harmon/Kardon didn't design one on this set
 It does have a mute function
 Tap both volume buttons simultaneously and it prevents the annoying feedback you get when you unplug them from your computer

 I found this out on my own, which leads to my next gripe.-Poor instructions


 Most systems indicate left and right channels and explain functions and features


 I have noticed with other Harman products that while their instructions have excellent diagrams, they tend to lack much written instruction

 Which speaker is the left and which is the right?  And that mute function


 Not listed in the instructions.-Lastly, and this is just my observation, I think the subwoofer should have some kind of protection covering the vent port
 Has anyone ever dropped something in it?  Or wondered about debris getting inside?  I haven't had any problems with this, but it's just my observation and something I thought Harman should address.Overall, I have been very pleased with this set

 Again the sound is AWSOME!  But it does have a few quirks that could make or break a buyer's decision


 I do believe that anyone who buys these will be pleased.

$review_text.: I used this to hook a TV in an exercise room to the DirecTV receiver in our bedroom.  Our house has conduit running to all of the rooms so it was easy to run 2 CAT5e cables from our bedroom to the exercise room.  At first I ran 2 runs of approx. 70 feet and hooked it up, the picture was perfect but there was no sound.  I was able to cut around 10 feet off both runs and tried it again and it worked. (Perhaps with CAT6 cable it would work at 98 feet?)  So far it has worked great except it cuts out for a brief second whenever our air conditioner turns on.  I would buy it again.

 Only problem was that I could only connect in my sun-porch and half the time the signal was so low that I could not access the internet
 I ordered this unit that arrived promptly
 I used the install disk then connected the unit
 I instantly went from seeing 4 signals to 15

 I connected to the same neighbor and had almost full signal


 I was able to connect just as fast as if i were next to their router
 I can't wait to take this to the cottage and try to pick up the neighbor's signal


 They're much further away - I will post an update once I do
 As for the quality, it seems on the low end, but of course, for the price, it is just fine

$review_text.: This set was delivered 2 days ago.  The delivery company attached the stand and set up the tv and helped me get started.  Easy to program basic functions.  Lots of functions I have not had before so it will take a while to figure it all out.  Works great out of the box - looks great.  Vivid pictures on all channels but amazing on HD channels.  Picture is very crisp and the colors are amazing.  I have only had to adjust the picture aspect on the channels that are not 16:9 so that the pictures are not stretched, I have not had to adjust anything else.  I ordered the Samsung DVD-1090P upconvert DVD player and the two products communicate great with each other and the pictures are amazing.  The red touch-of-color is almost non-existent, but I didn't buy the tv for that.  Only improvement that I can see is to up the sound output a little bit.  The only other item I had to purchase was the HDMI cable 6 ft. HQ 1080P 1.3b to hook the Dvd player to the tv.  Great purchase, we are watching the US Open Golf in HD, wow.  We love it (would even be tempted to purchase a larger version, but this one is great.) Mine came with a cord to hook to the wall or tv stand to prevent tipping.

$REVIEW.: By Brendan PerryI've had this for some time now, and had no trouble at all using it to connect to a GPS receiver and my mouse - completely plug-and-play. However, the device does not seem to support A2DP, which means that while my stereo headset connects without a problem, I'm not able to pass audio to it. I'm planning on purchasing a slightly more expensive Broadcom-based model that fits about the same form factor (and expressly indicates that it supports A2DP).Note that it's also possible that the issue I'm experiencing is a software rather than a hardware issue, but given that I'm unable to install the necessary drivers for support of my device, I assume it's a hardware incompatibility.Edit 12/29/09: I received my new adapter and confirmed that the problems I was experiencing were hardware related - this device either does not support A2DP, or simply doesn't support audio devices at all. Audio devices you pair with your computer will appear as installed devices, but will not be available to Windows as playback devices, so you won't get any sound from them.

$REVIEW.: This might have such a reasonable price because the supplied grounded data cable ends in an exterior-type USB 2.0 connector instead of a 9-pin motherboard connector. So you may have to route it out the rear of the chassis to plug in to an exterior USB jack - which is what I did. The second visible power connector is for a 4-pin floppy disk jack, which is very convenient and eliminates the need for using the "5VDC" plug. The result is, the hub has power straight from the power supply without taxing your other USB connections.

$REVIEW.: I don't usually give products 5 stars, but this little guy exceeded my expectations. I run Windows XP Professional, and it took me far longer to get the package open than it did to install this thing and get it working! I plugged it in, and about 20 seconds later, I was downloading pictures from my digital camera. It reads quite fast, and can take high capacity type II flash cards - making this a good investment, as I believe that the majority of cameras/MP3 devices are going to begin to migrate to type compact flash type II storage, as it offers a lot more capacity and speed than SD or MMC storage types. It's working fine with my Viking 256 meg flash card.Pros:+ easy installation. It appears as another drive on your system, making it as simple as copying to and from a floppy.+ good speed.+ cool silver appearance - no ugly translucent junk.+ ability to take type I and type II cards means that you most likely won't be left out in the cold with future upgrades to your flash memory using devices.Cons:- could be a little smaller, with perhaps a keychain loop. - Perhaps in the next revision .

$REVIEW.: I have both this headset and the much cheaper Kinivo BTH220 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone and I must say that this one is the better set
Costing almost twice as much though, this is more than expected.A quick review:Comfort: Excellent
The main portion of the set has a nice weight and rests around the neck nicely, does not get in the way, does not fall off easily and the controls are pretty intuitive after  wearing it a while

The ear buds are likewise comfortable


You can turn your head every which way and you will not run out of cord.Audio: Great

Both the call and music audio sounds great

More rich than the Kinivo headset I have
Of course it is still no $300 studio headset, but it is still very nice.Build Quality: Excellent


This thing feels like it is made to be comfortable in every way and does not feel flimsy or cheap.Conclusion: If you would like a nice, quality headset with good audio quality and you can afford to pay a bit extra for it, this is the one to get
The Kinivo set is nice enough, but this set is just better


You do get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: My car is equipped with a Bluetooth stereo. Frankly, it has me spoiled. I was excited to try out the AYL Mini Touch BoomBox, but was also a little pessimistic.My first fear: How would sound?I have to say that the first time I turned on the Mini Touch, I was surprised. For such a small box it produces very consistent sound. The bass sounds like bass, the treble sounds like treble. Is it home stereo quality? No. But more than passable and compared to other speakers I&#8217;ve tried, excellent.My second fear: How would going between my car and the Mini Touch work?Turns out, it is effortless. I have never had to resync the Mini Touch to my phone. If I was playing a song in the car and then turn on the Mini Touch, that song starts playing again. And it works going the other way too.My last fear: Seriously? Touch controls? Just give me some buttons!Ok, this last fear may seem odd. Especially if you haven&#8217;t seen the Mini Touch. The controls are invisible until the unit is powered on. However, once it is on, the control areas are lit up red. The controls are very responsive. Just don&#8217;t try to use them with gloves on.Note: This unit was provided to me free of charge in exchange for an honest review of the product.

$REVIEW.: The backpack is quality made. I had it for many months now and it looks brand new. I am sure it will last many more.The one big problem I have with it is that the front compartment (the smallest one) has a zipper opening that only opens its very top so you cannot see much inside the actual compartment. You really cannot see anything in that compartment so you have to "feel" for the things you need. This is also the only one compartment with many different small pockets and such to put individual pencils or gadgets or whatnot, but what good are they if you CAN'T see anything inside. Even if you hold it in an angle in direct bright light it barely helps. This is obvious from the picture actually. The front compartment is very deep and yet only opens at its very top.I know this sounds like a minor issue but trust me it is not. I would have returned the item but I had to travel and had no time for it.

$REVIEW.: I recently moved from California to Ohio and made the drive in about 4 days. In the past for such long trips I used to visit the local AAA for a trip ticket, one of those handy driver tools of yesterday with your route highlighted throughout many pages of maps.The TomTom VIA is an amazing replacement for that and much more. I simply spoke my new address and the device located the destination, calculated the best route (with estimated time) and I was off.Along the way it helped me avoid city traffic by leading me along less crowded roads. At times I thought it wasn't working correctly because I seemed to be taking some obscure route - but I decided to trust it and see what happened. Each and every time it came through like a champ.Now that I've been in my new town here in Ohio for a little over a week, I've been using the TomTom VIA every day to help me get to know my way around. It's gotten me to stores and restaurants in the area and has proved indispensable.The features I love most:* Speak an address or place (like gas station) where you want to go. No more clumsy typing in exact addresses.* Better then a phonebook: It will locate specific stores, restaurants, parks, etc. in any given location. It also provides phone numbers of those places.* Hands-free phone conversations. You can set the TomTom VIA to auto-answer your mobile phone. The unit's speakers then broadcast the voice and its built-in mic lets you have a clear conversation.* Screen is large enough so that you can see what's coming up.* The voice is customizable and easy to understand - directions make sense and are clear and concise.

$REVIEW.: For what these are, they're well-made. As noted, they do not come with instructions; it's assumed that you know how to install them. If you've never done it before, it might not be obvious how to do it right: strip the wire about 1/4&#34;, push it through the bottom section of the jack, fan out the stripped wire and fold it over the rim of the bottom portion, making sure to spread it out evenly, and then screw the bottom into the pin section until it bottoms out. That will compress the wire into place.Obviously, these will not work with solid wire. They will work best with 14-16AWG stranded copper wire.Now, if you have good speakers, you probably have binding posts that will take banana plugs. Those are a better choice if you have the option. If you're looking for pin plugs, you probably have less-expensive speakers. Generally, on less-expensive speakers, you've got two closely-spaced clamp-type connectors. The problem there is, if you use these connectors, they're likely to touch each other behind the speaker... and thus short out, because the uninsulated metal bodies of these connectors carry the speaker line voltage. You can work around this by using electrical tape or heat-shrink tubing to insulate one or both connectors. Compared to competing pin-type connectors with insulated barrels, this is more work and less attractive.

$review_text.: I embraced Tivo about 5 years ago, but stopped using my Series2 box when I went HD with my 50" Plasma.  I began using a Comcast DVR box and for months just accepted that this was the best that I could do.  That time is now over.I going to tell you right now. You drop over 2 grand for a TV - drop the cash on the Tivo Series3.  It is an entirely new experience.  A Comcast DVR is technologically disgusting.  There is no interface.  No feel.  To boot you pay for both the DVR service AND rental on the box!!! The Tivo service is right in line as far as fees go, and if you buy 2 years, you get a 3rd year free right now!Buy this unit and do not look back.  Then tell your friends.  People truly do not know what they are missing.  I also recommend the Logitech Harmony 880 remote to tie all of you components together.  One remote, the best DVR, and HDTV - it does not get any better.

$REVIEW.: Purchased mine direct from Amazon, authentic Stroboframe. Nice little unit, solid cast steel with black oxide coating. Two small springs between the plates allow the mount to open and release your speedlight.Downside, there is a small bit of Pem hardware that protrudes from the base (for an on-camera type of bracket) making flush mounting impossible. The Solution was to grind it off since it's of no use to my application (lightstand). Pliars won't budge it and I didn't want to drill it out.It's a shame that this little piece costs as much as it does but at least it isn't going to fall apart anytime soon.EDIT 12/30/2011: I just received a second unit, this one via another vendor, not Adorama, and it was aluminum and plastic, not at all like the genuine Stroboframe unit I had received previously. I contacted Amazon and they took great care of me, giving a full refund, free return shipping and selling me another unit directly from Amazon. GOT TO LOVE AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

$REVIEW.: This is essentially a tiny 32GB hard drive with USB and wireless connection. The reason it stands out is because it can wirelessly connect. That's important because many devices such as phones, tablets and iPads don't have a USB port. With this little device you can store 32GB's worth of music, video or data and can access it with USB or wirelessly. The wireless part is with wifi and not bluetooth.To access it with USB, just stick it in the USB port. To access wirelessly you first have to download the app, which is as easy as pie.Overall, I found this device to be pretty nifty and useful when travelling or going places, you basically got an extra 32GB worth of music or videos and no internet needed. Highly recommended as inexpensive wireless storage!

$review_text.: I use this for my Pioneer AppRadio 2
 I wasn't going to pay for Pioneer's option which is some places were as much as $80


So I tried and MHL adapter and a micro USB cable but after a few months I started getting HDMI dropout
 So this was my next logical (and inexpensive) solution


 The best part is it has the 11 pin adapter on the micro USB cable so it works for Note II, III, Galaxy S3 and S4 (check against the list on Pioneer's website, anyone that says adapter you won't need it

) ONE cable to rule them all! No really, having one cable gives you a single point of failure, it's  cheaper and it's easier to just replace the cable if it ever starts acting up later on


 I will follow up in about 4 or 5 more months.

$SUMMARY.: Because $80 on cables for Pioneer's AppRadio 2 or 3 is too much

$review_text.: We bought this Sony Bravia NX810 to replace an older Hitachi 1080i HD-DVI projection TV, one which never failed to dominate and totally overpower any room in which we put it, because the cabinet was so huge.  Even moving it from one house to another required partial disassembly, and both pieces were mega-heavy.  Three factors went into our decision to shop for a new set:  We didn't want to move the old one again, save to load it onto a donation truck.  Second, although still functional, we were noticing some loss of contrast and fuzziness that no amount of convergence adjustment or cleaning could fix.Finally, Amazon's holiday 'Cyber-Week' discount pricing and combination bundle deals (3D accessory kit w/Alice 3D AND a 160GB 3D-capable PS3, both free) were way too good to pass up.So in my usual meticulous way I checked out all the offers of comparably-sized sets on Amazon, as well as reviews online, and I even made a trip to our local Costco to check out their display sets, so I could see for myself the difference between regular LCD, edge-lit LED LCD, plasma, and DLP televisions.  Of all of them, it seemed to me the Sony KDL-55NX810 blew the rest away, with only a few of the plasma models coming even close.  Between the Samsung and the Sony 3D set-ups there in the store, I felt the latter had the superior 3D effects and shutter glasses, plus overall the Sony looked to be the better quality.Unlike some folks who bought through Amazon, we had no problem with the Pilot freight shipping.  They arrived right within the scheduled time, unboxed the TV, attached it to its base and put it on the cabinet we already had set and ready for it.  I had done some prep work, and have a highly customized home theater set-up, so for testing I just took our older Sony blu-ray player and hooked it directly into the TV with an HDMI cable.  Having read here about some of the problems of dead sets on arrival or display issues, I'd decided it was only prudent to ensure proper functioning BEFORE the installers left.  There were no problems or issues in the TV itself; later I'd find some oddities with the HDMI connections which I now suspect were either cable and/or hand-shaking issues.Pros:- Beautiful, sharp, bright picture, with a high degree of customization possible for personal preference, room conditions, and even decent automatic adjustments based on what the TV thinks you're watching- 3D was even better than what I sampled in the store, although it does take a little getting used to.  Very nice with video games, and good with movies.  (We don't have DirecTV, so I can't comment on their 3D programming.)- Surprisingly wide viewing angles without any distortion or drop-off.- Integration with other Sony equipment is seamless, so much so that I sometimes have to check to remember whether I'm controlling the TV, or the PS3, or our older no-feature Sony blu-ray player.  The TV can even turn on/off and control the volume of our home theater receiver through the HDMI line.- No problem getting the TV to connect to our home wireless-N network, and the signal is strong enough to stream Netflix without interruption or quality down-stepping.  Nice feature about the NX810 is it has wireless and wired Ethernet built right in.- The provided Sony remote control is pretty nice and well laid out, but has no learning capabilities.  (I suspect my spouse is getting me a new universal remote for Christmas...).Cons:- Some HDMI set-up issues for us.  Our Denon receiver is supposed to be able to route full HDMI signals to the TV, and to support the latest HDMI standards (including 3D), but it doesn't -- TV says there's no signal.  So I connected all our equipment directly to the TV instead, and that helped, and I can get the receiver to work, but reliably only after I added an optical cable to serve as audio return -- which isn't supposed to be necessary either.  I've ordered a better/newer HDMI cable to see if this helps.  Meanwhile though, the TV does manage to control volume and power on/off for the receiver through the HDMI connection.  So I'm still puzzling this one out; if folks have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.- Didn't like the motion-flow default settings.  As other reviewers mentioned, while it might appeal to some, it tended to make TV shows and movies look weird and soap opera-ish.  No other way to describe it, just that it didn't seem natural.- As other reviewers have noted, the built-in speakers are rather weak, tinny, with little bass.  You can get better sound out of even a hundred dollar 2.1 computer speaker set.  Really Sony?  Why not include an inexpensive passive sub-woofer with the TV, and beef-up the built-in audio power and speakers just a little?  It's worth noting however that none of the thin-screen TVs I checked out had what I'd consider home-theater quality sound.- Internet video streaming does require a high-speed broadband connection.- There just aren't that many 3D movies out there yet, and a few of the high-demand ones are locked into ridiculously long exclusivity deals. (I'm looking at you Panasonic: Your reportedly year-long "Avatar" lock-in actually made me -less- likely to buy your product, not more, because I found the exclusion deal personally offensive, even though I really want to see that film in 3D again.)- The 3D glasses are somewhat on the heavy side, but this is the case with any shutter glasses.  When watching 3D movies, you might want to take breaks, at least until you get used to wearing them for extended periods.Recommendations:- Do have the location ready for when the installers arrive, that way you can have them set up the TV and you can really check to make sure the TV is working right.  Don't let them leave until you're certain you're satisfied with the TV.  Fact is though, no matter where you buy it, there can be problems during shipping and/or delivery.- Try to buy big-ticket items like this from stores and vendors with a no-hassle returns policy.  Amazon's is great, with 30 days to decide whether you like the TV or not, or to uncover product defects.- If you don't have an existing home theater audio set-up, I do recommend getting one of those powered TV speaker cabinet-stands they sell, or else a nice 2.1 Harmon-Kardin (or comparable) computer speaker set and hook those up to the TV, either through the audio out in the back or use the headphone jack.- If you have kids or rambunctious pets, absolutely do ensure the TV is either attached to the wall using a VESA-standard mount, or that the table-top mount is fastened/screwed to the supporting cabinet.  It's an important safety measure.- Check your HDMI cables.  Although older cables will usually work, there can be performance and feature issues with old or low speed ones.  It's essential to use a high speed cable between your 3D blu-ray player and the TV.  (Hint: Use the cable that comes with the 3D accessory kit for the 3D blu-ray to TV connection. It's guaranteed to work.)- Make sure to go through all the papers and fliers that come with the TV -- we discovered among them a number of unadvertised special promotion items, including several free PS3 3D games (free for download, enter a scratch-off code) and two bonus 3D blu-ray discs (Bolt (yay!) and Michael Jackson (meh)) just for registering our set online with Sony, plus subscription offers for Netflix, Hulu Plus, and more.Would we recommend this TV to a friend?  Yes, definitely.On edit, August 18 2011: Well, we've had the set for eight months now, and continue to be very happy with it. Nearly all of the audio problems I reported before were apparently HDMI cable-related, but here's the thing: I was always using the correctly rated cables. It's just that some work between one device and another, but move them to a different device and they don't. Or just never properly at all. Anyway, if you get audio cut-out problems or failure for devices to be recognized, my recommendation now is always "get another HDMI cable."

$review_text.: Kato built a terrific radio that is ruined by lack of squelch or scanning. Yes, it scans, to find active frequencies to store, but it does NOT scan when trying to monitor. Even if it did this, it still misses through its lack of squelch. I don't mind "white noise" but even living just 6 miles from LaGuardia and monitoring tower/arrival/departure, after a few minutes, the noise is unbearable, being more than twice as loud as communications when they happen. So, turn the volume down for reasonable level of white noise, and you can't hear what's being said! Turn the voices up to where you can actually hear what's being said, and when they are done (which is usually very quickly) you are almost tossed across the room by the painfully loud static again. I'm trashing this radio and trying the Uniden desk top scanner next. At least it has a squelch control... stay tuned!

$REVIEW.: Okay, this is a very nice device - the aluminum case is attractive, has a little bit of style, the tiny green LED lights sparkle like teeny stars

 The size is surprisingly compact considering that it contains a 64gb USB flash drive, and a rechargeable battery, and an SD card reader, and a Wireless-N router, but is the same size as my tiny travel router


 The use of a standard micro-USB to USB cord means that it is easily replaced if lost

 It can be charged from USB or from AC outlet, using included cable and adapter.SanDisk makes excellent flash drives (that's their main business), so it is expected that they would make a good memory storage device.However, there are a number of deficiencies in this device, all of which seem related to the firmware
 It is standard in the technology industry for marketing pressures to cause software to be released before it is ready (I say this from first hand experience), so some of the following seems to stem from that:* The USB transfer from the device to a laptop through a USB 2.0 port is nowheres as fast as other USB 2.0 devices

This is confirmed by a few other reviewers

This is odd for a SanDisk memory device, there is clearly some firmware glitch which needs to be fixed.* The Wireless access will not work if it is plugged into USB - so you cannot run it "powered", you have to run it from battery and then charge up the battery again
 If you are using it in a home situation, this just causes an additional task (plugging it in to be charged), when it would be more convenient to keep the USB plugged in to a laptop or PC when it is streaming.* There is no wireless access from Windows or from a browser

 The browser access is promised in the future by a firmware update (which would then cover Windows by default)


 This is a major gap in functionality, but at least it is under development.* The lack of support of video types that are not in the default Android standard, means that there is very little video functionality
 I have a video player app installed, but Media Drive does not know about it, nor does it include its own video player for common video file types

 This makes the video streaming functionality limited
 (This has been mentioned so often, that it is a FAQ question, but it is still a significant limitation

SanDisk could write or buy video player functionality to include in the app,  for "pocket change" relative to the total development budget of this product, but they have not done so.)Outside of the above issues, the wireless connection and Android app work fine, and it makes a decent 64gb USB flash drive (except for the speed issue mentioned above)

 I did not test the SD card reader, but some strange issues with that support are detailed in other reviews.Hopefully, future firmware updates will allow me to raise the grade from three stars.

The only negative is that on high it is about as loud as a regular room fan on low. To get the 10 degrees you will need it on high.  If you only need about 5C then you can run this on low where it is very quiet.The degree readings were performed using a video benchmarking tool (Furmark) and compared the cooling based on setting and case temperatures.  Temperatures were also monitored using a separate monitoring tool for fan speeds, core temps, case temps, and GPU temps.

I purchased this card hoping it would be faster than the 100x speed cards. The speed difference is barely noticeable considering the price difference. If you're shooting jpeg on a DX camera, I'm sure this would perform excellent. However, shooting RAW on a FX camera like the D800, there is some lag time when reviewing photos. Lexar is a brand you can trust though with recovering files. I've never had a problem to date.

$REVIEW.: I just bought the Kingston RAM to update my Dell laptop from 1GB to 2GB... The memory install was a snap, repowered my laptop and the computer now sees 2GB... My computer is much faster...Kingston has been around for a while so I recognized the name in a good memory provider. I went to Fry's and they had a new brand called Centon, while cheaper, I had not heard anything about the brand. The salesman says it is a new brand and they do not know if people are having problems so for a few more dollars I bought Kingston (a brand that I know about).Most, of the negative reviews, seem to be of the variety of being shipped the wrong memory and not the product performance and/or reliability. I bought this same RAM in a store and know that it is a 1GB DIMM...Update:I also updated the memory in an old Dell desktop from 1GB to 2GB with the PC3200 Kingston chip...In replacing the desktop and laptop I noticed that both machines were getting a lot hotter. The laptop felt much warmer and the desktop had this foul heat smell... I did some searching on Google and there were some issues with the vendors that Kingston is specifying and their chips do get hot... It seems that there is also a similar issue in Samsung memory as well (they used similar or the same vendors)...I decided to replace all of the Kingston chips with Corsair and the computers while warmer were not that hot and the smell went away on the Dell desktop.If I was creating a new review I would give it at most a two since there was a product defect (which can lead to frying parts or a fire hazard). I wanted to like this product; I know the name but this is a serious issue...

$REVIEW.: One of the few covers for the Lenovo Lynx. It fits well, protects the device well, and has the nice magnets that shut the tablet off when closed.My only complaint with the cover is that I wish the lower, left corner was cut out like the upper left corner. Why? Because the Lynx has the power in the upper left hand corner. Which is fine when you have the tablet in the case in the way that you can clearly tell it was designed for. But, I wish I could turn the tablet upside down in the case and have the Home button at the top. This way I could have the micro USB to USB dongle in, utilize a jump drive, and still be able to have the tablet resting in my lap or on the table utilzing the stand on the case.This is why the case gets 4 out of 5 stars. Doesn't seem like a big issue, but it really does become a problem if you want to utilize the micro USB while using the device.

Took it to an Apple store and they hooked it up to their in store WIFI network. I took it home and it is working fine. The second one had been damaged in initial set up and we could not get it to work. Caveat emptor. I will be returning it to the seller.

$REVIEW.: This Zalman represents a very interesting rethink of the mouse design. The user's right hand (The FPS-GUN is not ambidextrous) holds the the rear part of the mouse in a pistol grip. Instead of a barrel on top of the handle, the front part of the mouse extends forward from underneath the user's hand. The optical mouse sensor is located about 1/4 of the length from the front, which is roughly 4 inches away from the thumb where the optical sensors of traditional mice can be found.The whole design is so radically different from the traditional mouse that it unsurprisingly takes quite some getting-used-to. The differences here are not just in form but also in functionality. Some of them are beneficial; others not much so. Let me discuss the bad aspects first.By far the greatest downside in this design is the loss of precision resulting from the distance between the sensor and the user's palm. A traditional mouse sits directly beneath the palm and allows very precise control. The 4 inch distance makes it much much harder to do minute adjustments. Imagine that, instead of holding a pen the way you are used to, you are told to write with a very long pen with 4 inches of a tip from your fingers to the writing surface, and you will get the idea. Making matter worse is the change of orientations of the two primary mouse buttons. Instead of pressing downward onto the desk, your fingers are pulling pistol triggers. This pulling motion now easily shakes the cursor. As a result, I find checking small boxes on screen to be much harder than before.The scroll wheel presents a relatively minor problem. Scrolling is now done by the thumb. After awhile, I get used to it, except for the difficulty of clicking the wheel, which by default serves as the middle button. Eventually, I choose to remap the middle button function to other keys.Due to size of this mouse, a large mouse pad is a must. I found theWOW!PAD LFR48 11.5" x 12.5" Graphite Large Format Mouse Padto be a perfect match.On the positive side, the pistol grip is very easy on the wrist. Instead of side-way movements, the wrist bends in and out, which involves stronger muscles that are much less likely to get sour or worse. Ergonomics is therefore the greatest reason to recommend this mouse. As for its intended purpose of playing FPS (First Person Shooter), I find that the grip enhances immersiveness but the lost of precision can be problematic. This issue is particularly serious when the in-game weapon is something requiring careful aiming, e.g. a sniper rifle.Overall, the build quality is quite good. The price has come down close to bargain level. Given how innovative it is, I, as a technology enthusiast, want very much to like it. So far, I am still willing to endure its shortcomings and have not switched back to the very solidLogitech G500 Programmable Gaming Mouse, but I can imagine that, for some others at least, the G500 may be the better choice.

$REVIEW.: .I bought my WX-17 weather radio about a year ago.  I use it occasionally.First, to get the bad out of the way:I just found out the four AA batteries are terribly difficult to insert.  Instead of the four batteries laying side-by-side, they are arranged two-on-top-of-two.  Each battery position includes one spring-terminal.  The top two springs stick out and get in the way of putting batteries into the bottom two positions, and there's no wiggle room, so it's hard to avoid damaging the top springs when you're loading the bottom two positions.  Even excepting the 2-over-2 arrangement, the batteries fit into their positions very very tightly.The battery compartment incorporates a nice little ribbon which helps pull the batteries out and threatens to damage the top two springs upon battery removal, also.If you're planning on mostly using battery power, I would recommend the design of the battery compartment is a deal breaker.  It's too bad.The tuning knob moves the mechanical tuning-indicator needle.  But there are no creaking sounds when I tune, and it works very smoothly.  So if there is a cord connecting the knob to the needle, they did a good design.  Continuing the tradition from the 1940's technology, if you keep spinning the tuning knob after you get to the end of the dial, there's concern about messing up the tuning dial's calibration, and it also might stress the cord.  But after spinning the tuning knob at the end of the dial (like a gorilla), I have been unable to change the dial calibration.  In other words, it's nothing to worry about.My tuning needle is two degrees off vertical, but I got used to it.The handle and the telescoping antenna ask to be handled gently.  The handle is lightweight, and telescoping antennas have a way of painfully breaking in half.  To aggravate the situation, if you ever want to extend the handle to use it, the antenna has to be completely collapsed and docked to get out of the handle's way.  (After extending the handle, the antenna may be re-extended, and they live together fairly well.)  When not being used, the little handle nests out of the way.  Besides, the radio is so small and light, you won't be wanting to use the handle, anyway.With the radio switched to the Alert position, a tiny amount of weather-audio leaks out of the speaker.  But if you're more than a foot from the radio, you can't hear the leakage.When the AC goes out, the radio does not automatically switch to battery-power.  You have to unplug the AC adapter from the side of the radio to actuate the batteries.White plastic looks antiseptic.****The good is endless:I would recommend this radio, especially for 25 bucks and 25 cents, which ain't a lot in today's dollars.  Qualifies for free, snail-shipping.  I rated this radio 4-out-of-5 Amazonians.  The rating is relative and subjective, depending on what you're expecting from the product.For a little plastic radio, I feel it's built strong, with good components and quality controls.It's about the size of a basketball player's hand.  Squeezing the radio, I don't feel the plastic shell squish at all -- it's deceptively strong plastic.  The shell is completely tight, without any hint of coming apart.All sections of the telescoping antenna slide smoothly.There are Power and Low Battery indicator LEDs.  The battery indicator would be useful if the radio were left in the Alert position, slowly draining the batteries.  Of course, using the [included] AC adapter, the Low Battery light stays off.The rotary Volume control works smoothly, feels a little velvety.The On/Off button is a two-position slider-switch, separate from the Volume control.  If you menacingly try to push the On/Off slider into the radio (like a gorilla), it refuses to give inwards, as if it's supported from behind.For tuning the weather, the radio acts like it's crystal controlled (maybe it is) -- no tuning required, since the 7 weather-channels are selected with a 7-position switch, therefore you don't use the tuning knob for the weather.  Each of the 7 channels are "always on frequency;" all you have to do is select a channel and swivel the antenna.  It takes some minor force to move the 7 position switch, but it moves smoothly.  The 7 positions are close together, but the tightness of the switch's motion makes it easy to avoid overshooting the desired channel.There's another switch -- AM/FM/Weather/Alert.  If you don't put the switch into the Alert position, you won't wake up when there's a Warning.  And the alarm won't wake up your neighbors, either.NOAA says they "normally run tests each Wednesday between 10 a.m. and noon local time," so you can check your radio's Weather Alert function.  I haven't tried it yet, but I think when there's an alert, the radio's volume switches to Maximum (regardless of what the Volume control is set to), and then it lets those loud tones through.It would be bad if the loudspeaker were unable to cope with an extended, maximum-volume tone, multiple times.  Of course, the radio only costs 25 smackkers, so if those Alert tones finally blow up the loudspeaker, the radio won't cost much to replace.  Alternately, loudspeakers can be designed to survive; maybe this is one.  Best luck.The sound is noticeably better than an old transistor radio -- good for voice, good for weather, good for background music if you're tolerant.  Feeding the Speaker Output into external "computer speakers" does a world of good, and the jack is tight.  If the computer speakers are amplified, recommend a Radio Shack "Attenuated Dubbing Cord" to connect the radio to the speakers, so you don't blow up the speakers.  The audio coming out of the speaker jack is Mono, so the mono-dubbing-cord is just right.The FM receiver is very clean.  It doesn't have a problem with images, and it has good AFC action, so it's easy to tune, and the sensitivity is ok.  If you ever fought with an analog FM tuner, you'll be amazed how nice and smooth this one works -- digital tuner not required.  Lots of stars for [mono] FM quality.Since it takes many turns of the tuning knob to tune through an AM signal, the AM receiver must have Very Wide selectivity.  But I don't hear any distortion, and it sounds pleasingly good.---------12/13/13Ugh, we had a blackout for 18 hours.  I took out my WX-17 with a handful of AA batteries, in the cold, in the dark.  Well, not completely dark.  But wouldn't you know it -- when I was pushing the bottom layer of batteries into the compartment, the springs on the top layer got in the way and I tore one off.  I had to wad up a piece of aluminum foil to replace the spring and complete the connection.On the brighter side, the batteries were still good after playing for 16 hours, including lullabies at night, something to break the eery silence, etc.  I never did hear any acknowledgement on the radio that the ice storm had resulted in widespread blackouts.  And the utility did a very bad job of keeping their website updated with repair estimates (I was reading on my smartphone).

$review_text.: I got this reader for my HP Pavilion dv9000 series laptop to read images from my Canon EOS 40D, because I was unpatient waiting for large quantities to upload over USB interface. I was pleasantly surprised at the great increase in speed when uploading photos, but it's important to remember that while a maximum of 300mb/s is possible, it will only transfer as fast as the read speed rate on your CF card. Mine is an Extreme III, so 30mb/s is still much faster than USB, which hovers around 11mb/s. I also find it much more convenient to take the card from the camera and pop it in whereas with USB straight from the camera requires fussing around with wires. If you have an ExpressCard slot, it's worth your while to consider buying this reader.UPDATE: After using this reader for a couple of months, I notice that when transfering large quantities of photos, a small percentage tend to get corrupted, so don't clear your CF card until you're sure all your images went through. If any of your images become corrupted, import them specifically and you shouldn't have a problem the second time around. And I want to stress the fact that it's a very small percentage of files and have not marred this reader for me at all.

$review_text.: This headset offers fantastic sound quality, a mic that stays in place (and out of the way), and exceptional comfort.Comfort issues first:Unlike a couple of the other reviewers, I do not find its soft velveteen ear-cup linings irritating, or even unusually hot (and it was in the high 80s today inside my house). They do trap some heat, just because they cup your ears, but if you need more airflow you can adjust them a little larger than you need, and they do not pinch so tightly as to give you a headache. My ears (which are rather large) also fit fairly well inside them and are not in any way pinched or hampered. Comfort wise, these are definitely top notch for this style of headset. As another reviewer pointed out the mic does not stick out in front of your mouth, but this is intentional (and quite common nowadays), and in no way affects sound quality.To the sound:Voice quality is great. I wouldn't use it for studio recording, but for the voice chat and phone call market it seems intended for, it's great. It doesn't seem to cancel out background noise, but it does not advertise this feature, and unless you have a lot going on in the background, it should be inaudible to your teammates. As for incoming sound, it's a little above average for a standard stereo headset, which is to say it isn't as good as speakers, but everything is crisp and clear. It seems to have good bass response, and actually has a little more trouble with higher range notes (I first noticed this with  Symphonic Classical music's cymbal crashes, and didn't ever notice it in the Classic Rock I play while gaming, or in game or voice sounds themselves). If you want superb, game-changing sound, go for the surround sound version of this headset.Overall:I can't think of much bad to say about the headset. It's exactly what it purports itself to be, which is a comfortable gaming/voice chatting headset with standard stereo sound. Plantronics hit a home run with this one in my book, and in my experience, they always do. I should add that I haven't had the headset long yet, but as it was a self-chosen birthday gift, I spent most of the day testing it. ;)UPDATE 1/29/2011: I originally purchased this item in Spring/Summer of 2010. A year has nearly passed, and I thought I should update the review with a longer-term opinion. That is what follows:After a year of use for voice chat, video calls, and video gaming, I can't say I've found anything seriously wrong with this headset. I frequently wish the cord was just a little longer, or that it was wireless, as I use it with my desktop and it has to travel a significant distance behind the desk to get to my head. It is always comfortable, and only gets over-warm if the room I'm in is already fairly warm (Above 80 degrees Farenheit or so and I wouldn't wear it for prolonged periods). While I'd like an upgrade with simulated surround sound at some point, this headset still deserves five stars. It delivers great performance at a great price.

$REVIEW.: Okay I ordered this mouse because I love having the most up to date devices I can afford and get my hands to, besides having another reliable Logitech mouse already at home, when I read the description of this mouse I was blown away with curiosity and I had to see for myself.The DarkField technology implemented in this mouse really works as stated in the product description.The installation was a breeze as well, no need to install the software CD with it if you choose not to. (although it is recommended if you need to customize the buttons which by default already come pre-set therefore no need to install the aforementioned CD.)As soon as I plugged in the receiver into my computer and other computers I have at home, all the computer recognized the device within a matter of 10-15 seconds and soon I was on my way scrolling and literally flying through pages with this mouse. (I still didn't install the CD software mind you.)In conclusion if all you want is a good reliable mouse that will practically work in any surface and you don't have time or patience to deal with installing CDs and all you want is to plug and forget, get this mouse because it's medium sized (perfect for most individuals) and it can go perfect with laptops too since the size of it it's between a laptop mouse and a desktop mouse and it's light, comfortable and simply works great.I highly recommend this.~VT~

$REVIEW.: Paired with decent speakers, this does the job pretty well.  It seems to be a bit biased toward the top end (although I haven't hooked up a subwoofer to the included output yet), but it pumps out plenty of power and gives a lot of options for inputs.  The fan is almost comically loud though, so don't expect to use this to play music quietly unless you keep the amp in a separate room from the speakers.  Overall, it's a good cheap way to power a party, but don't expect to make it the centerpiece of your high-end living room sound system.

$review_text.: I bought a pair of these used, in excellent condition for $50, not here, just for disclosure, I used them as spare speakers in a workshop and this is what I think after listening to them for a while.Do I know what I'm talking about?  I build speakers as a hobby and my main setup consists of Snell XA90's and McIntosh amplifiers.  So I know what 'good' sounds like and how to make speakers that sound that way.So, as others have said they look nice, I can't disagree there but they are also fairly big, and for as big as they are you're not really getting much sound out of them.  So, how do they sound?High range: very harsh when pushed, lacks detail, very bright.  (If you listen to anything with violin/piano in it you may want to just click to another speaker now)Midrange: Rather hollow sounding in the upper midrange and weak in the lower midrange and also lacks detail, but it's still probably the strong point of the speaker.Bass: None.  It's simply not there, specs say 40Hz.  All lies.  I've tried several amps and checked the phase repeatedly thinking I had to have messed it up but no, it just isn't there, they'll do a very weak 60Hz as their lowest usable bass and even then the woofers have no x-max to move air with.  To really put it in perspective, I compared their bass to a pair of old 4&#34; Realistic bookshelf speakers (also sealed cabinet), and those even had far more bass than these.Intangibles/Comments: imaging is terrible, off axis response is laughable, any sound that's supposed to have 'weight' to it just doesn't, they sound very weak but aggressive at the same time due to the harsh treble.Cabinet: thin MDF.  No internal fill/damping.  No real crossover network, just caps on the mid and tweeter (which, for this speaker works to an extent, but it is very cheap and cone breakup from the midrange in the treble is probably part of why they sound so bad in the high range.)  Cheap spring clips.  No mounting options.  No speaker feet. Looks nice with the grills off though.Drivers: cheap.  very cheap.  very, very, laughably cheap.  Cloth surrounds (the cheapest).  Woofer has no x-max whatsoever.  Tiny magnets.  Tiny voice coils.Now, for a non-discerning listener who has a subwoofer to pair these with and just wants &#34;big speakers&#34; these are probably fine.  But if you actually plan on listening to your music/movies, please, buy something else.  The Micca MB42X is cheaper and sounds far better (check noaudiophile for a professional level review of those).  If you still want a 3 way design Genius makes a decent set of computer speakers that are better than these and they're even powered.  If you really want bass, get the Bic Venturi 6.5&#34; speakers.  If you want something that looks fancy the Jamo P404's (amazon has them for $150 at the moment, I bought those, at that price you're basically stealing them, they sound phenomenal and I'll review them after they've broken in a bit more; but if that deal ends then the HiVi D-1080-IV gets my vote, HiVi makes great drivers and very well designed speakers).  I've made finding/modding cheap speakers that aren't terrible a bit of an extra hobby, and these were anything but a diamond in the rough.
$review_summary.: Look nice, but the sound's a bit garbage.

$REVIEW.: This isn't a $300 tripod, but for $20 you are getting a good value.Pros+ 60 inch height+ Carrying handle+ Comes with carrying bag.+ Price+ LightweightThis unit comes already assembled in its carrying bag and is incredibly light and relatively compact (24&#34;). The carrying handle on the unit is convenient but being so light it doesn't matter where you grab it really. This is my first tripod and I didn't want to spend that much because I've already invested so much into my camera gear. With that being said I think it is designed well enough to support the weight of my camera confidently.Cons- Plastic construction- Weak leg supports- WobblyAt this price range you can only expect it to made of mostly plastic. The pan and tilt aren't perfect but should do fine if all you're using this for is shooting stills, its functions may not be suitable if you're using this for video and expect smooth operation. The leg supports are simply stamped aluminum meaning they can bend easily. The unit is incredibly wobbly when fully extended but that is why they add the hook towards the bottom. A heavy camera bag should solve the wobbly issue when hung from the hook and bring stability, or you could anchor the tripod to the ground with some thin rope if you're on uneven terrain.

$review_text.: This charger is a lifesaver. I have 2 now because of how great and fast it is.  If you have a lot of devices like me (Ipad 2 & 4, Iphone, Note 3, and Misc other USB devices) and need it charged quickly, this will do it for you.  I have not found any other usb charger on the market at this charging rate and at this quality for the price.  I can charge all 4 devices at almost max speed (~2.1amp) which is especially important for the new retina ipads that need a little longer charging time.  The cord length is perfect because not everyone can stay near a outlet.  This is a great product and it will not let you down (As with any anker product)Also, the Black color has a more matte black look and feel.  The white has a clear coat look and feel.  I have both and both are great either way.  I just feel that the black will not slip on any surface. So if you need the matte grip texture, get the black.

$review_text.: Needed a small pair of marine speakers for a jon boat I converted into a bass boat. Have these mounted in the front panel of a bench seat made of 1/2" plywood.  They were very easy to mount, the included speaker wiring was easy to attach.  Have them hooked up to the rear channel of a Dual 60 watt receiver and was very surprised at the quality of sound coming from them.  Definitely more bass than expected and the vocals were clear.  We're not going to be blasting it out on the water but it has some volume to it if we wanted to.  Would I install these in a car, more than likely no, but for what we'll be using them for they sound great.  Not very experienced with speaker installs, so I thought the mounting depth was the length of the speaker behind what it was being mounted to.  I thought it was going to be 1.5" back from the front base of the speaker, but it was more like 2.5 or 3 (from the very front where the screws pop out of the back, not from the plywood because obviously any different size plywood would either add or subtract from the length from the back side of the plywood.)  They still fit being a smaller speaker but if I ever replace them I'll have to investigate further. I used the cardboard holders the speakers came in as a template for the cutout.

$REVIEW.: Love, love this mouse!!In recent months, I've been working on my computer almost constantly - and I have tried about 6-8 mice to find one that really fits my hand and is easy to use for long periods.This is THE ONE!!I previously had been using the MX Revolution for several months - and before that the Logitech G7, the Logitech VX Nano cordless, a couple Microsoft mice, etc.The MX Revolution is a great mouse, too, but from the outset, it never fit my hand that great - I think you need like an abnormally long thumb or something for it to feel right. And the VX Nano is too small for continuous daily use (unless maybe if you have really small hands). But both these mice are just super high quality devices - the speed wheel and the smoothness of the buttons, etc. are fantastic. Lots of customization options (though I'm not a big user of these).But my hand's been aching of late using the MX Revolution, so I thought I'd take another look at the Logitech lineup to see if anything new to try.So now I've got the MX 1100 and it is a TOTAL WINNER. This one has the great speed wheel and the smooth buttons. I can't really comment on the customization options since I don't really use them - but they look easy to use and so on.But perhaps the most important thing is that it really fits my hand well. Since I have reasonably normal sized hands, I expect it would fit most people's hands well, too. The ergonomic improvement over the MX Revolution is instantly obvious the second you put your hand on it - the shape is just right and it simply feels more comfortableI also really like that this one runs on batteries. I found the MX Revolution recharging a real pain cause it was always dying when you needed it most. I ended up keeping 2 mice around at all times so I'd have something to use while the Revolution was recharging.Overall, this is a well designed, superstar product! It's a bit pricey, but well worth the money for most any computer user - whether you're a poweruser, a regular office worker, or anybody else who spends a few hours a day on a computer.
$review_summary.: Best mouse ever!!

$review_text.: I've has a Bose SoundDock 10 for two years. I use it primarily as a wireless Bluetooth speaker but have also used plugged in to my TV as a soundbar. Overall the sound is good, but not as good as the smaller, less expensive Bose bookshelf speakers. SoundDock has a great sound for music at high volumes, but bass and low notes are almost inaudible unless the volume is cranked up. Morever, it handles dialogue poorly and is not very good for watching TV or movies. The Bluetooth connection has been erratic and unreliable since I bought it. Pairing involves multiple attempts where I have to unplug the power to the speaker and hold down the pairing button before it will connect. The SoundDock does not juggle multiple paired devices well either, and I often have to pair my iPad, iPhone, and Kindle Fire over again if I switch among devices. Since I purchased the SoundDock, a number of less expensive alternatives like the Jawbone Jambox and the Creative C100 have come onto the market. A conventional speaker and a separate plug-in Bluetooth receiver might also be a good buy. I'm not sure that I would purchase a SoundDock again.

$review_text.: I have had these binoculars for about five months now.  I did a lot of shopping around and comparison before I plunked down my hard earned coin.  I tried various models and makes at three different optical shops and borrowed, borrowed and borrowed some more from friends and family (Birders all).  Of all the binoculars I tried and tested these were by far the best for the money.  I was trying to hold the cost down to below six hundred dollars and strongly feel I bought binoculars here that are way more worth what I paid for them.The clarity on these things in absolutely amazing.  This review is in reference to the 8.5x45 ones.  I had been using 10x... in the past but to be honest when it comes to the identification of birds in woodlands and meadows, it would be hard to beat these things.  Now don't take me wrong.  If you are doing water or sea birds and having to spot out at great distances, then you do need more power...I use a spotter scope for that.One of the best features on these bins is that I am able to start birding earlier and stay later because these thing really draw in the light and are great for use in shaded areas.  Also, I have smaller hands and these fit perfectly.  The focus wheel is smooth with absolutely NO play what so ever.  They are relatively light yet have a very strong "feel" to them.  I have used these in very wet conditions and they are indeed waterproof.  I like the way the lens caps are attached.  These are very comfortable binoculars to use and carry.There are indeed better binoculars out there but as far as I can tell and have found, for the price these would be very near impossible to beat.
$SUMMARY.: Difficult to find better at this price.  One of the best bins for under 600 I have ever used or tried

$review_text.: This is an amazing product and I give Lenovo and Display Link 5 Stars for their part, but before I start with the review I just don't understand why this product does not have more that 1 to 2 stars on it, I mean this is not a bad product and is actually better than my Targus Docking Station. First of this Thinkpad Dock has 7 USB 3.0 Ports and one is dedicated to charging a USB device (ex. iPad, iPod, iPhone, etc,), it also features 2 DVI ports (note, that one of the DVI ports is DVI-D, meaning, its DVI Digital and can not be used with a DVI to VGA converter as the other DVI port can), also it features a Gigabit Ethernet Port (thanks to USB 3.0 now internet speeds are faster than before), and finally there is a Headphone/Microphone jack in the front for audio purposes. For my testing I wanted to try to put the USB 3.0 to its limits (since my USB 2.0 to VGA connector was the worst product ever) so I ran 2 HD YouTube videos, while transferring a 8.25 GB Torrent, and the dock ran fine with no lag, crash, or errors. So far so good! Furthermore, I wanted to put this dock to its limits (as a test run) so I ran Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Mutiplayer and Combat Arms, and surprisingly it ran with not lag or problems! (Do note, that this is a business dock and this is not really designed for gaming so if you want to buy this for gaming purposes use this money to buy a video card.) Overall, this is a really nice dock and I would give it 3 extra stars if I could for: having a dedicated charging port (in this case for my iPod 4G), a dedicated on and off switch on the top for power saving and turning on the computer from sleep mode, and how the video (that is ran by Display Link) is superb, with no problems or BSOD (as one other reviewer stated). So get this product if you want a nice USB 3.0 Docking Station solution for your laptop! (Note my tests were done using a Lenovo Ideapad S405 laptop with an A6 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB HDD)

They are by far the best headphones I've ever owned for working out. They do not move out of place at all on a five mile run.Cons: The only con is that the headphones move out of place if you do bench press or any other weightlifting exercise where your head lays against something. I knew this before I bought them and its just a Con of having a design like this.I recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of headphones for working out or any other active activity. I chose these over the ear bud versions because I figured these would be better for running. People who only weight lift might like the ear bud version better but these are hard to beat.

$review_text.: It just keeps going and going.There may be more user-friendly routers out there for neophytes, but people that are specifically looking for the, "GL," version of this product are most likely not neophytes.  As you might suspect, the WRT54GL is a great platform if you want to try 3rd party firmware such as DD-WRT, Tomato or something else.  I tried both DD-WRT and Tomato on this router and both installed without a hitch.  To be perfectly honest, I don't need this router to act as an IP/Sec tunnel end-point nor have I any need to SSH into my router (what would I do once I SSH'ed there anyway?).  I am just using the stock firmware from Liksys, and it works fine, not needing any attention or reboots whatsoever for at least months at a time.Something to keep in mind is that tweakers think they can boost performance by hacking the power of the RF otuput higher using alternate firmware.  While it is possible, the radio in the WRT54GL will also put out more distortion and more power, so your signal to noise ratio won't improve much, if any, at the receiver.  It is best to stick with the default profile maximum 13 dBm output.  You'd be better off using better antennas with a directional pattern to provide effective gain.  You also can't make the radio receiver in the WRT54GL any more sensitive without a better antenna anyway.  At least the dual RP-TNC connectors on the WRT54GL make it easy to experiment with improving the antennas and/or amplifiers.There are newer sleeker looking products that may have more fun LEDs and curvy plastic cases to entertain you.  The WRT54GL is well made and will last years if you don't absuse it or expose it to harsh dusty or wet conditions.  The most likely weak spot in a conusmer grade product is the wall-wart power pack.  Cisco/Linksys have been going back and forth on what they supply for the power pack.  In the two WRT54GLs that I most recently bought from Amazon, the power packs have iron core trnasformers instead using capacitor based switching regulators.  The transformer based power packs will probably out-last power packs that use switching technology to lower the wall voltage to operate the router.I have several WRT54GLs and several of their older WRT54 Linux based predecessors and have found they perform well and will last at least several years in a home environment.  I haven't had any of the WRT54GLs fail, but I did have an older WRT54 die at almost the end of it its warranty.  Cisco replaced the bad unit, but it took two tries, with the first replacement being completely DOA.  The second replacement is still working after several years.This is a great product for home or a medium duty office enviornment.

$review_text.: It is plenty big enough to hold the power strip with all plugs filled and with space to also hold the extra cords and cables
 It has grippy rubber feet to keep it from slipping around and the lid has small tabs to keep it in place


 The only downside is the price
 Although it is plastic, it is not thin and cheap but it is still just a plastic box

 If you have $30, it will make the pile of cords and plugs behind the big TV or under the desk tidy enough to please the wife.

$review_text.: My first experience with this adapter was favorable. I was able to download the updated drivers and install it properly on my MacBook Pro. The speed was noticeably faster than the wifi I had previously been using at work and everything looked good.Unfortunately, I cannot give this adapter the five stars that I was initially inclined to give. I have to regularly remove the adapter from my laptop to go to meetings and every now and then, at random, removing the adapter causes the operating system to crash. This happens on average once a day. Until an updated driver solves that problem, the most I can give it is two stars.

$review_text.: This is a review for Fujifilm DVD-R disks.  I don't know how long they have been in my closet but it cannot have been more than a year or so.  I mention this because some DVD-R disks have been reviewed as using a dye that more easily degrades over time.  As to reliability, I am getting about 80% duds from a 25-pack of the Fujifilm disks.  I am using an older version of Nero for the burning software.  I have tried writing to two different DVD burners, neither of which have given me problems in the past.  After two coasters on each machine I wondered if I was trying to burn a file that was so corrupted that it would not write to the DVD.  I therefore wrote the file to a different hard drive - no problem there - and then tried to burn it to the DVD from that copy of the file.  Same problem.  I have decided to switch to a different brand and a different format, probably DVD+R which is reported to have better error checking and last longer for archiving.

$REVIEW.: A very easy replacement for a 5th gen ipod 30G HD.  I purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged.  It had the "sad ipod face" screen of death.  I could hear the HD trying to spin up, but not reading properly.  If you have that indication, all you need is this HD!The repair was easy.  Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in "backwards".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.  There are resources on the net for this...I just started up iTunes and plugged in the ipod.  After a few min. iTunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restored.Good luck!

The sound is excellent and they are very comfortable to wear and stay on snugly during exercise.  Funny - I liked them so much I actually bought another pair figuring that at some point my first pair would break from all of the use during exercise, but I'm happy to report I still have an unopened spare pair since my first pair still working perfectly (despite a few times tugging what I thought would be a bit too hard on the wires.).I definitely would recommend these to you fitness folks out there who like to listen to music during your workouts, but would also recommend them to anybody that prefers an "earhook" type of headphone.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this as a back up for one of my Foscam outdoor cameras.  Yesterday one of the power supply cords broke off.  Fortunately I had this back up.  I plugged it in and checked to see that it was working.  The green light on the outside of the unit glowed brightly!  Then within 20 minutes, I noticed the camera was not working.  I went out and checked to see what was wrong.  The green light was off.  I unplugged it and tried replugging it in.  It was then that I heard a rattle inside.  The fuse inside must have popped.  What a waste of money.

$REVIEW.: It is a large metal box that connects to the upper outlet with a rubber bumper over the lower outlet. Unlike many duplex surge protectors there is not way to fasten it to the center screw of the cover for the outlet. There is a metal tab that can be screwed to the top of the Tripp Lite surge protector and then lip over the plastic cover plate. Not a very strong attachment point and more likely to crack or break off the cover plate than to keep the surge protector in place.It is a good surge protector with isolation of the inbound and outbound current. It is a middle tier surge protector that is better than the cheap ones with only a MOV chip soldered to the receptacle which once the MOV chip blows with a surge will channel more current down the ground line which easily damages electronic equipment. The cheap MOV surge suppressors need to have at a minimum a light that lets you know when the MOV has blown. The Tripp Lite Isoblock2 has LED lights and if the red one is ever lit then it is time to dump it in the trash and buy a replacement unit as it will increase the chance of a surge damaging any attached equipment. For the highest level of protection equipment needs to be on an isolated ground as with equipment in hospitals where no failure is acceptable. This would certainly be wise to put into place for expensive home entertainment equipment and provides far greater protection at a lower cost than all the repackaged surge protectors sold by the home entertainment industry hucksters for this use.I am using this unit to provide some protection for a home furnace's control board from surges from our local utility, PG&E.; I would not use something like this for a computer or expensive television as it is only a simple and relatively crude device. The warranty reflects this as it provides prorated protection and mentions covering only up to the cost of the surge protector so don't buy this thinking that Tripp Lite will cover a damaged large screen TV or computer.For true protection a dual transformer line conditioner is needed to insure both full surge protection and that line voltages are kept within the limits needed for the attached electronic equipment. Only line conditioners like the ones from Oneac or special UPS devices that provide current from the battery which is in turn constantly being recharged will truly isolate the equipment from the line current coming into the building. Only these devices will insure that the minimum voltage needed is being supplied at all times to the attached equipment. Sags are more common than surges and can be equally damaging to electronic equipment and surge protectors like the Isoblok do nothing when this is occurring.In general it is more effective and cheaper to buy a $250 whole house surge protector and have a licensed electrician attach it in line with the power from the local utility than it is to buy a houseful of individual surge protectors which may or may not protect electronic equipment. A whole house protector also protects the electronics for today's wall ovens and dryers and other appliances which are very expensive to repair and cannot be protected with plug-in protectors like the Tripp Lite Isoblok2 or similar surge protection devices.

$review_text.: I purchased my iPad Air directly from Apple and then returned it without ever using it.  I was very disappointed to say the least when I learned the stereo speakers were on the bottom of the device.  What was the design team thinking?!!?  Obviously the iPad Air is a rushed product.  My review is not to bash the device.  Heck I love Apple.  I have an iMac, MacBook Pro, Classic iPod, Apple TV, and have owned an iPhone 3, 4 and currently own the iPhone 5.  The thing is I can not justify spending hundreds of $$$ on a product that should have been designed better.  Hopefully in 2014 the next iPad Air model will put the S T E R E O speakers on the FRONT of the device.UPDATE 12/4/2013: I just came back from The Apple Store to make it "official" that I have used an iPad Air.  Yes the iPad Air is thinner than previous iPad models and it may be faster.  Honestly I didn't see much of a difference in speed between the iPad Air and the iPad 4 while surfing the web.  That said I still see no reason to get an iPad Air if you already own an iPad 4.

$REVIEW.: There are a lot of confusing reviews for this, so I hope I can clear some things up with my recent purchase.I have the Gitzo 1581OT Ocean Traveler tripod and a Really Right Stuff BH-30 ballhead with lever release.First I will state that WITHOUT the RRS BH-30 ballhead the Gitzo Ocean Traveler with it's stock stainless steel ballhead will fit snuggly/easily/perfectly in this GC1201T bag.With the RRS BH-30 ballhead w/ lever release it's a little tricky to fit and zip up

After playing around for about 5 minutes in different ballhead positions, I found one where the bag can fully close without forcing it too much (just a little tug on the zipper)


Hopefully I will get around to uploading a picture of it to this gallery.Would I recommend this bag? Sure, on my other Gitzo 3 series mountaineer, I have the padded Gitzo shoulder strap on it which is more convenient for hiking on trails with (but it's so much more heavier!)


Also in how the traveler folds up, I do not think the Gitzo shoulder strap will work well as the legs have to flip/fold out (unless you plan to reattach the shoulder strap each time!), not to mention with it I do not think it will fit in this bag...so it was a trade off with one or the other
I could keep the tripod in it's not folding up position, and instead in the standard closed position and get a bigger bag (like the new Kata adjustable one) with the shoulder strap, but then it just defeats the whole purpose of a compact tripod design IMO.Yes the shoulder strap on this bag is not padded, but you can always improvise that and make your own out of fabrics, etc


I am about 5'10, and pretty much overweight at 230 pounds and detaching the velcro on the strap end you can extend the strap length like another poster mentioned


The strap does fit around me comfortably (with the exception of no pads on the strap).The extra pocket on the bag is a welcome to store a bubble level for the hotshoe, snacks, cellphone, and keys or just your standard Gitzo cleaning/repair kit


Most other tripod bags don't even have this outside pocket, so this is a +1 in my book.

It does a good job of protecting the Macbooks wrist pad which is prone to cracking on the front, but I have ordered the Moshi pad guard instead. Although the Moshi does not protect the keys from dust or spills it will protect the wrist pad from the cracking issue that all white Macbooks suffer. If you have this generation of Macbook I would urge you to get some protection for it, either this skin if you can tolerate it or the Moshi, as your precious Mac will eventually crack due to opening and closing.

 It is very soft inside and protects the Kindle! It is easier to place inside than the other ones I have purchased for our other Kindles (Neoprene Sleeve Case)

I feel it's more protected too! If you don't want to spend a lot of $$ on the hard covers and increase the weight by having a hard cover, this is the perfect solution

$review_text.: The pluses are Windows 8.1 loads fast, and operates fast


 The native search functions within the help page are pretty good.But the really, really, really frustrating thing is the full-page apps
 Since this is a desktop operating system, you should be able to toggle between operating in full-page to operating the app within a window in a traditional desktop

 Not being able to toggle betwene full-page mode and traditional windows mode greatly diminishes functionality compared to everything being a normal window (which, of course, can be expanded to full-screen mode anyway).I'm not sure what Microsoft was thinking with this

 When I use a browser, I often want to open other programs - i.e


using the browser to look up something about the app I am using
 If I use one of these full-page apps, I feel like I am crippled, and on Windows 8, there are MANY MANY apps that only operate in full-page mode.That said, I have NO PROBLEM with a Start Page instead of a Start Menu


 I have no problem with tiles vice icons, which is what most people complain about
 Maybe because I use a Trackball instead of a traditional mouse (Trackballs are ergonomically much more efficient than traditional mice), I find it quite pleasurable to use tile mode, and that it's just as easy as using the traditional icon and menu-based interface of older Windows versions.But having apps - especially system apps - that only operate in full-screen mode is NOT OK

 I don't know what they were thinking.But I give it three because it is FAST, it loads FAST, it makes efficient use of the CPU, to me it LOOKS VERY GOOD (at first I even preferred it to Windows 7, until I realized what a plague the full-page apps were).It looks like it also updates easilly, and refreshes quickly and easilly


 These are VERY BIG Pluses - but they are pluses easilly killed off by the problem of the full-page apps.So Microsoft - by someone who want's you to do well - PLEASE MAKE ALL APPS (but ESPECIALLY System and web-based/search apps) TOGGLEABLE BETWEEN FULL_PAGE AND TRADITIONAL Windows mode.I understand other decisions you've made, but this last one, for me, greatly hinders my ability to use this OS efficiently and enjoyably.



$SUMMARY.: The minus is the full-page apps that only operate in full-page mode, and that is a BIG minus. I'm OK with Start Page

$review_text.: I have now had this camera for six months
 I am SO glad I bought it

 Excellent pictures

 Easy to shoot

 I have never owned a slim camera like this, and find it constantly in my purse or pocket and getting taken out to use

 I even used it as a copier when my friend's daughter needed a copy of a handout and we didn't have a scanner
 We took the picture, popped the chip into the computer, and printed out a good quality copy.CONS: It's sometimes hard to get the adjustments right for the color in low light (they adjustments are there, but I'm not an expert on it)
 I wish the cover for the chip and battery was metal - it hasn't broken, but I'm sure it will be the first thing to go.I bought this camera after a lot of research and a very good picture by picture comparison by Pogue of the NY Times
 I am SO happy with it.

$REVIEW.: These Bose MIE2i's are great


 They are not perfect and even have a couple serious drawbacks

 But in my case, it's actually the drawbacks that make them the perfect IEM's for me!I have tried probably every type of IEM (In-Ear Monitor) that is out there

 Okay, I've tried a whole bunch of them - Klipsh, Shure, Denon, Altec Lansing, UE, to name a few
 The isolation and the sound quality of most medium to high-end IEM's ($100 - $300) is really good


 Great isolation and really high fidelity with audiophile quality
 I'm a huge fan of bass so I like hearing that thumping bass

 But I'm just one of those people that cannot tolerate IEM's

 After just about an hour of listening my ears begin to really become uncomfortable
 They begin to itch really bad like there is some bug making a nest in there

 Then they begin to hurt


 I also notice that if I ignore these sensations (as much as possible) and continue to use them for long periods of time, my ears go into overdrive creating wax


 It's like it's some sort of protective thing going on.So I had resigned myself to being able to only use over-ear or on-ear headphones


 The stock buds that come with most mp3 players and phones just don't stay in your ear well enough to be useful for much of anything


 But I still needed/wanted something to use for working out, bike riding, or just something to use at work when I didn't want to be walking around with a huge pair of Bose QC 15's on my head


 I recently just jumped on the iPhone4 bandwagon

 Once again I tried several sets in IEMs in the vain hope my ears could suddenly tolerate them

 No way

 So then I noticed that Bose had made their IEM's with dedicated Apple controls so I thought I'd give them a try and I was pleasantly surprised on a couple levels.The 'problem' with the Bose IEMs is that they have no isolation like most IEMs available today


 And as such the audio quality suffers
 You don't get that pounding bass that you 'feel' in your chest like you do with most normal IEMs

 This is too bad because you can tell that the audio quality is really quite good and if there was better isolation then the experience would be fantastic

 One minor caveat to this statement is that highs seem rather shrill to me
 I think that probably because of the lack of isolation, Bose boosts the levels in an attempt to compensate
 Unfortunately, most music today is so poorly recorded that clipping on the high end is rampant already so boosting these frequencies is a bad thing
 But this might also have something to do with my personal hearing which is very bad
 I suffer chronic tinnitus and hypersensitivity on certain frequencies from military service
 So take this with a grain of salt.But there's a couple major upsides to this lack of isolation
 First, they don't get uncomfortable at all
 These phones sit in my ears but do not completely block the canal and I do not get that itching or pain that I get from IEMs


 Also, the lack of isolation is good from the standpoint that you can use them in situations where you really do need to be aware of what's going on around you, like riding a bicycle in traffic or using them at work

 If a co-worker says something to you, you can hear it depending upon your volume of course


 This is good for me as I have to hear announcements on the paging system.The iPhone controller works fine


 It's kinda small and has no markings but it works fine
 The middle button is recessed slight from the top and bottom which makes discerning which button is which easy

 It's located up on the right side


 I guess they wanted it to blend in and not stand out, which is funny considering the obnoxious wire color scheme

 I just got back from the gym and when I walked past the full length mirror had to laugh at how much they stood out with the black and white twist color scheme

 Hopefully future models will offer either black OR white!  There is also a small plastic clip for attaching the cord to a shirt to help with stabilization

 There is no cord movement noise transmitted to the ear which is a plus.So the things that for many would make these a bad choice make them a perfect choice for someone like me with specific criteria.Other considerations:Construction:  They seem extremely well made


 The cord is a good thickness and seems very sturdy and should last with care


 The buds are the same way, very well made and look sturdy

 The package comes with a very nice zippered padded soft case that has some rigidity that is roomy and should provide good protection in normal conditions

 It would likely not do so in a harsh environment such as a backpack filled with heavy books and what not

 An update to this review is with this padded case

 The size is perfect


 You can roll up the headphones around your fingers and easily put them into the case

 Also, the case just happens to fit the iPhone 4 perfectly (without the headphones of course)

 I don't know if this was by design but it's great at the gym

 After I remove the headphones and plug them into the phone I put the iPhone into the case and zip it up
 This provides the iPhone with great protection from sweat and other bumps when working out
 Good job Bose!Style:  This area is a huge disappointment
 Bose usually makes pretty good looking stuff


 These are the exception


 They chose to go with a black and white cord color which just looks stupid
 I guess maybe they thought they were being clever and would appeal to those who want white or black only
 They totally missed the mark though


 In my opinion, this just looks stupid

 Also, the part of the bud that sticks out of your ear has a huge chrome Bose strip on it which I guess is supposed to make it scream, "Hey everyone, look at me, I'm wearing Bose!"  Again, they missed the mark


 Unless you're the type that needs to make sure everyone knows what brand of product you are wearing, this isn't for you


 I'm a 50-year-old guy so I don't care what I look like
 But if you have style considerations, you might want to look elsewhere unless Bling is your thing!Sound:  The sound is definitely pretty good

 Like I said, they lose a lot of bass because of the lack of seal but they still get the job done

 As with ALL Apple products, the sound quality of the source unit is suspect at best so it's not a huge deal anyway.Comfort:  Here is where these shine

 I can wear them for hours and forget they are there
 Then have these new stay-in arms that keep the buds stable and in your ear without causing discomfort

 This is probably the single biggest reason to buy these, at least for me


 This alone bumps these from 3 star to 4 star.Price/value:  As with all Bose products, they are overpriced
 You can get a lot of IEM for the price of these

 They are certainly not prohibitively priced and in my case because the do what the others did not or could not, they were worth the price.

$review_text.: First off.Let me say that I was a bit concerned after reading the other reviews. While they almost all said that it was hard to figure out, the ONLY trouble I had was fitting the rubber eye piece inside the eye piece frame. (it's a bit like putting a bike tire on a rim..you have to work your way around while holding it in place)The white material is  soft, flexible, and LOOKS like it will repel water (I have not tried it out yet). After the above assembly, the eye piece is an open hole, allowing you to see your subject clearly. (no looking through vinyl material like some others) The only vinyl material is around the eye piece, which allows you to see the various buttons, top of camera, and LCD view finder on your body.There is PLENTY of space for just about any type of tripod head (I use a ballhead). In fact, the only problem I can see is if you use your camera "off tripod", where the extra material might get in your way. Still. There is enough Velcro pieces on this where I'm sure you can tuck it all in and secure it just fine, while still leaving room for your hands. I would not use this off tripod because I would worry about rain running down the camera straps. But that's me.There are instructions included, but I didn't even see them (still in the handy carry bag) until I was re-packing the rain cover (shows you how easy it was to figure out). I might not have had the set up exactly like they said, but I can see there are several ways you can make this work depending on your set up (again, plenty of Velcro).They supply a total of three rubber eye pieces (in case you drop one). Not just the small rubber piece that you insert, but these are actual eye pieces that slide down over your body's viewer (you have to remove your makers eye piece to use it, so put it in your pocket or some place safe while you use the other)While I bought the SMALL size, It measured 17 inches from the back of the camera to the end of the tube your lens goes in. I also tried it with a couple other lenses, a shorter prime lens (35mm), and an 11-16mm zoom. The fit is fine so long as you tuck in the extra material before you Velcro everything down. Just use a bit of fore thought when tucking extra material in so you dont channel water back INTO your camera.I've posted some photos that I took of the set up, to show the various parts of this cover. (I had to use my point & shoot, so please excuse the quality)One piece of advice....put everything together at home a time or two before trying it in the field. When in the field, put it together in the car BEFORE going out in the rain. Just makes sence to me.There is no doubt that I would advise a friend to buy this, as I will do just that (every shooter I know lives in Oregon and Oregon is WET!)One reviewer said this is the same rain cover that has the 'Canon" logo on it. If this is the case, I can see no reason to pay the extra money for the logo only.

$REVIEW.: I just bought a tablet without bluetooth and needed a wired keyboard
 I originally bought a GMYLE...don't do it ..

keys sporadically work
 This keyboard is great and if you hook up a IO Gear or Belkin micro usb to usb hub you can use this keyboard, a mouse and charge your tablet all at once

 And, I'd also bought another portable keyboard before the GMYLE that had the spacebar over to the left too far


 The guide when getting a portable keyboard is to make sure the spacebar falls fully underneath the letter M so that when you are tying your thumb hits it with your right hand..
this one fits the bill.

$review_text.: On paper, this monitor sounds great but I recently picked one up and discovered that the USB 3.0 Hub is completely defective on the vast majority of versions out there. If you plug the USB cable into a USB 2.0 connector on your motherboard or use only USB 2.0 devices, then the problem does not appear, but as soon as you use a USB 3.0 connector and a USB 3.0 device, the Hub fails to function. In USB 3.0 mode, the monitor either does not recognize the device or cycles between connected/disconnected. There's nothing you can do to fix it as it is broken at the hardware level.My guess is most people who own the monitor either don't have USB 3.0 ports on their motherboard or own no USB 3.0 devices, but as I wanted to use this monitor for the next 5 years or so, this was unacceptable to me. And yes, I tried with different USB cables, USB 2.0 and 3.0 devices, and even a different computer. Problem was the same in all cases.Worse yet, Dell knows about the issue and has not issued a recall: [...]Dell recommends you contact them for a replacement but I am not performing an in-warranty replacement on a monitor that I've owned for less than a week. Furthermore, the Dell support forum is filled with people who sent back new U2713H models only to receive refurbished models with the same broken USB 3.0 hub. Other people were told they do not qualify for the replacement because they owned the monitor for more than a month even though the warranty on this monitor is 3 years.I quickly returned this monitor as it is defective and therefore should be recalled. Supposedly there is a "REV 02" that does not have this problem but this is unconfirmed and most suppliers, Amazon included, will not tell you the REV number that you are getting.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE: I can live with weird shadows through RGB connection. I was going to return the item, but luckily I tested one of my computers that has HDMI. It worked just the way it suppose to with expected picture quality. However, the reason why I came here and raised the stars all the way from 1 to 4 is because of how low the risk you're taking when purchasing from Amazon!!!!!!!!!! On thursday evening I ordered the TV return to Amazon and today, Monday morning the UPS guy came to pick it up. I was like wow. Amazon doesn't joke around with customer satisfaction, and I read it in many other reviews who purchased this TV. I've been shopping here for over a year and will now generally shop at Amazon, because I know I'm not going to be let down.I kept the TV.TV has a beautiful picture, no less than high end brand I saw at Fry's. I was going to buy Sony, because it's the "best". but I learned in one of their best TV's negative reviews that customer service didn't help when they were suppose to, the client was basically burned, paying twice as much for such TV. I don't believe in positive anecdotes, I read only the worst case scenarios when investing. So I decided to go for cheaper brand, little that I knew cheaper doesn't mean worse in today's world! It's actually better, wise investors know what I mean.You know how documentary videos look clean and actual movies look blurrier on old TV's? Now on this tv even most old movies look like documentary quality clean. I can't describe it with other words, you have to see this thing ^_^OLD REVIEW:I have just received this tv and still testing it. I'm only testing the VGA display since I purchased the panel for computer monitoring purpose only. The Colors are ok although should be much more vibrant. But Every image has a shadow next to it which almost doubles it and it's very visible and annoying. Any suggestions before I decide to return the item??? I appreciate your help.I went to youtube and checked out the 3d movies and I only saw blurry picture not 3D at all even through glasses.Plugged in the VGA port properly. Everything seems to be ok, except these annoying shadows :(

$REVIEW.: Good idea... Western Digital bacame mediocre quality over last decade. The drive worked for one month before it died in extrenal enclosure. If you think this was glitch and perhaps one piece then you think the same i initially tought. however thi is my third WD drive in different enclosure working contgnously. All three died over last months.Simply put WD does not offer any reliable drive that could be used for contignuous backups. I used to love WD dard drives as built number of PCs using them, but not anymore. Also they seem to heat up like old Maxtors. They become worse quality year after year.I am switching to Samsung and Hitachi for comparisons. I need full time incremental backups running on USB reliably for my Mac computers (Time Machine).I wish WD was really conducting their reliablity tests so MTBF is not a lie on paper for some who cannot verify it - consumers.

$REVIEW.: I needed a CMOS clock battery for an old IBM THinkPad 600E laptop that was forgetting time and date.  The battery is easy to get at under a bottom cover by removing one screw. I purchased a  single CR2025 3V lithium battery and tried soldering the wires (with connector) from the old battery to the new battery, but could not get solder to stick to the metal of the new CR2025 battery (the original wires were spot welded).  So I purchased this ready made battery with wires and connector. When starting to plug this new battery into the laptop, I noticed the red and black wires were reversed on the connector.  Fortunately I was able to carefully removed the contacts from the connector housing and correct the reversed polarity. (It takes sharp tweezers, a pin and magnifier to do this as the connector is quite small.) After fixing the reversed plus (red wire) and minus (black wire), the battery plugged into the IBM ThinkPad 600E laptop and worked fine. So I suggest that you compare the red and black wires of your old battery to this new battery to make sure it is correct before plugging it into your computer.

$review_text.: Rangefinder user perspective.Overall I'm very happy with this camerabag,  it works well and is comfortable in use, though I don't feel quite the excitement as some of the other reviewers, maybe because a compact bag is not really a new thing for most rangefinder users.The bag comes with two compartment dividers, the ones folded for a handgrip, clearly a nod to DSLR's  using the dividers my M9 sit snugly mounted with a 35mm, stuffing a 75lux next to it and maybe one more in the last space.My problem is that most pockets for "stuff" open in, there is a large pocket with some smaller pocket, once the bag is loaded with a camera and lenses it is hard to get the logical place for SD cards and batteries.There is also a flap-pocket inside on the ends of the case, again, hard to get to while the bag is loaded, so in practical use I find myself unloading the lens, then getting a battery and then putting the lens back in.ON each end outside there is a vertical pocket, but these are rather tight and I can not fit my light-meter into either of these pocket.  Maybe a elastic edge on the next review of this design.Interestingly, this is really a digital-bag, there is not really a place to stick a brick of film.  You could be quite comfortable though with a body+lens +1 spare lens + film.. which REALLY is a lot, personally I find I take the best pictures when not bringing too much to distract me.WISH FOR: single piece camera compartment padded insert, the pocket on the back big enough for my iPad. Access to those pockets on the end and a Velcro closed dedicated storage for SD cards.That said, Im keeping mine, I put a camera insert with two pockets from another old back in it and now I can stuff my iPad between the insert and the back of the bag. it travels nicely with the M9+35lux and 75lux, plus accessories, but there is a lot of spaces I can not really access which therefore becomes "wasted" pockets and features.  (I really don't like to pick on this bag, I like it and enjoy using it)CONCLUSION: Really, this is a VERY nice back,  I love the pine-something finish, the bag is finished to perfection and the "look and feel" is simply outstanding, but I feel it fails to live up to the generally legendary functionality of photographer inspired think-tank bags.

I have to turn off the blue-tooth option on my tablet and then turn it on again to get it to start back up
 I have fast cable wireless/wired internet and have no other problems with any of my other devices, so this one puzzles me

 When I do get it to work, it does work ------  for awhile
 Then, I have to start over turning it off and on again

 I have had other blue-tooth devices attached to my tablet and they continue to work uninterrupted, but for some reason, this little mini speaker is temperamental

 I will work with it to see what I can find out and then edit my comments later


 BTW, when it does work and I set the mini speaker in another room, it is loud


 However, distance will be an issue for me as this thing only works up to 30 feet and no more before it drops off.

$REVIEW.: I originally bought the Garmin 205 for my husband several years ago.  He loved it; so we bought the 305 a year later for our son who is a long distance runner.  With both of these Garmin units, we managed to get through a couple of years with minimal operational problems.  Then, this summer following a long evening training run, our son plugged his 305 into his laptop to upload his run...and the Garmin unit did a major screw-up on his laptop.  He's a college student and the university tech services department had his laptop for weeks trying to "undo" the damage that the Garmin did to his computer.  In the midst of the issues with the 305, my husband's 205 stopped working.  We sent the 205 in to Garmin and paid the $69 for repair (you actually just get a refurbished one back, not the one you sent in).  We also went ahead and ordered a new Garmin 210 for him to use until the 205 came back.  It arrived and he actually liked its more streamlined size and ease of use. However, 2 months from purchase and it went kaput also.  Fortunately, we did receive the refurbished 205 back before we had to send them the 210.Bottom-line:  When they're working okay, the Garmin watches are invaluable as a training aid.  My husband and son also compete in numerous marathons, halfs, and 10Ks so the units help them to stay on pace (plus they always like to check to see if the race distance is accurate).  Unfortunately, though, I think you have to be prepared to replace them fairly frequently.
$review_summary.: I'd give the Garmin watches 5 Stars for funtionality...but only 1-2 Stars for dependability

$review_text.: I owned the Harmony 880 for several years and disliked the offbeat, inconvenient button layout so much we only used it to turn the system on and off.  It was just an additional remote that cluttered up the table.The Harmony One is the beautiful princess sister of the ugly duckling 880.  I actually enjoyed setting it up, since it's a little like a puzzle to get everything perfect, such as programming the buttons and screens to get exactly what you want.  But once you do, it's a great remote.  I especially like the fact that the buttons light up, in a tasteful way, when you remove it from the cradle, so you can easily use it in a darkened room.I never had a problem with the battery of the 880, even after using it for three or four years.  I hope the same will be true with the Harmony One.

$REVIEW.: Most the people reviewing this mount didnt do their research.  Not all tv's have the same vesa pattern.  It would hold the weight of a 42 inch tv as long as the vesa pattern on the tv is within the specs of the mount.  It also mention its length, so those complaining it wont reach your studs should have read the product description.  I bought it for a 32&#34; in sceptre tv I wanted wall mounted in my work out room.  The sceptre ways about 25lbs,  I mounted it to 1 stud with two lag bolts and 4 heavy duty dry wall anchors that are rated to 265lbs each.  This mount inst going anywhere.  Also the bubble level on mine was actually accurate. It comes with some various hardware to mount the tv.  I didnt use any though.  Went to the hardware store and got some stronger hardware for about 2 bucks.  also since the mount is so small it doesnt block any ports my 32 inch sceptre.  The only negative i have is that one of the arms &#34;prongs?&#34;  that hang on the mount, was a little bent. I bent it back.  Cant complaing though,  I mean come on, it was $10.
$SUMMARY.: For 10 bucks it does the trick.

$REVIEW.: I frequently have to transfer large amounts of data (500MB+) between computers in the office and my home computer. Prior to buying this drive I burned CD's since that was the only way to get the data back and forth. After looking into USB flash drives I thought this would make my life a lot easier but I was wrong. Transferring large amounts of data is so slow that burning a CD is a lot faster. To give you an example, I just tried to copy 700MB (8,500 files in 150 folders) from my hard disc to the flash drive and it is taking about 1.5 hours to transfer all files. That makes it unusable for my purpose. By the way, I'm using it under Windows XP.According to Kingston's webpage they have (more expensive) flash drives with data-boost technology which are faster (e.g. DataTraveler II Plus). Maybe I should've done more research before buying.Update: Compressing all the files into one large zip-file (300MB) reduces the transfer time to roughly 5 minutes. So I guess the drive just doesn't like transfering many files (8500 files).

It took just a little time to get use to where the headphone buttons were but no real problem. Even though the surround sound is digital simulation it is sure good enough for a non expert like me. It also surprised me how quickly the headphones recharged. I have some hearing loss and found that these headphones actually help with clarity of high frequency sounds.  All in all I was very pleased with my RS170 and would highly advise giving them a try. The quality is every bit of what I had expected and more.

$review_text.: The Pyle Bluetooth headphones are inexpensive, sound good, and are lightweight. For people with a normal sized head, these headphones work great; if you have a big head the band is tight and presses hard on my head. They also interfere with glasses.Bluetooth is solid and quick to pair with an iPhone. Press and hold the Phone button on the side of the headphone, the LED will flash quickly showing it is in pairing mode, in the phone settings PHBT5 will show up, touch that device and pairing is complete. All the controls work from the right speaker - front and rear edge advance and move back the track, the top edge answers the phone. The volume controls are on top of the right speaker. The buttons are firm and feel really good. The microphone works surprisingly well. Sound on both ends was crystal clear.The speakers are covered with comfortable foam that has a velvet texture.There are a few things I don't like about these headphones. I will never understand why companies decide to use stupid charging plugs - this uses a minuscule jack that looks a like the Nokia N95 micro charging connector. The cable plugs into a USB port - you can use a computer, an AC adapter (like the one included with an iPhone), or a power bank battery pack. Just don't lose this cable. They could have made things really simple - just use a microUSB cable. I have a big head and the headband is way too tight. The headphones don't sit level on my ears.Considering the price, Bluetooth, and great speakerphone, I like these headphones.I was provided a review sample

$REVIEW.: Love the Cowon mp3 players and have always been gospel as the go-to player for audiophiles.  However, I found these days, when you're just listening to mp3 files at highest or near highest bit rate which is what most people listen to given they are readily found in itunes or Amazon, then this player is not really necessary.I thought I treat myself again to the best audio having taken a break from the audiophile world and its many blogs and reviews.  Seems like this is the best mp3 player offered from Cowon so I grabbed it regardless of the price.  I must say it feels quite a downgrade from the J3 which I also own, however, I do like the stealth/industrial look.  This does look like a player made for audiophiles as opposed to general listening public.  The android os while more practical takes a long time to boot up.  The touchscreen is extremely sluggish and no match for J3 touchscreen.  When comparing with my current player, the Sansa Clip, a very raw sounding player and respected player as well, there is almost no difference in terms of sound quality.  The use of Cowon's EQ would undoubtedly make it sound better than the Clip but I prefer my music no frills and the way it was meant to sound by the artist.Other than the Z2's outstanding battery life and friendlier menu, there is really no reason not to buy the Clip instead if you're just looking for sound quality.Again, this is testing with high quality mp3 files and results may be different if you listen to flac or large wav files.  I have tried the latter and comparison of latter with mp3 is like cd vs cassette tape.  I finally decided that I really don't want to spend time converting files or transferring large files to my player, and not to mention looking for these online which is almost impossible.  I decided to just go with the sensible approach of listening to high quality mp3 files.I would suggest a good set of headphones for anyone wanting to get the most mileage on their music.  And you need not spend the ridiculous amount of money on one either.  I own the Senn IE800 and I must say listening to high quality mp3s, it was only a tad clearer than the Panasonic RPHJE120D.  Price difference?  Try $800 vs $8!!!!  And the clarity on the IE800 is basically non-existent if you're listening music on the train or other noisy places.  Even while walking, the stomping noise you make will cancel out any gain from the IE800.This was a costly test, and in the end, the least expensive option wins out and just spending on the Clip ($50) + Panasonic RPHJE120D ($8) = total of ($58) will yield a great listening combo way ahead of everyone else.

$review_text.: I've had 3 different models of Bluetooth headphones over the last few years, but the ones that I can always count on to be reliable and sound decent are these S305's. They work with every bluetooth device I own, and have perfect sync on all of them. I've had these for 2-3 years.Positives:1. They are excellent on the Sony Playstation Vita. I don't use any other bluetooth headphones on the Vita because all of them I've tried have some issue with the system. (Though, with the Tenqa's, that issue is just that it lacks a equalizer to fix the too basey sound) I actually only use these on the Vita now, unless I really need to watch video on my phone.2. Standard Micro USB port. It's never an issue to charge these as I have Micro USB chargers everywhere.3. Completely reliable with my PC & Asus Bluetooth4. Completely solid with both my old Motorola Droid 2 and newer HTC Droid DNA phones5. They fit well and aren't too heavy.6. No irritating bright lights to distract me and others around me.7. Separate controls for all functions.8. Sound quality is fully adequate, with no need to screw around with an equalizer to make it sound right.Negatives1. Battery life. It's atrocious. I might get 3-4 hours out of them on a charge max.2. I don't use these when exercising because of all the horror stories out there about them getting wet.3. Band is a bit large for me, and I bump it on things when laying down with the headphones, and it can tend to knock my headphones slightly loose when that happens.

$review_text.: After a couple of years with the S5IS, I'm pretty happy.  Wide flexibility in a relatively small and light package.  Takes wonderfully sharp and balanced image-stabilized pictures at 80 or 100 ISO.  Has a zoom range that used to require 10 pounds of lenses.  Focuses quickly and dependably.  Takes truly decent videos with stereo sound.  Stores images on inexpensive SD cards.  Has a moveable, articulated LCD screen.  Runs "forever" on four rechargeable AA batteries if composition's done through the viewfinder - a feature that's becoming increasingly rare on non-DSLR cameras.Sure . . . . pictures start getting noisy fast at ISO 200 and above.  Changing settings beyond what's under the "function" button can be user-unfriendly.  Low-light performance and bokeh pale in comparison to even a basic current DSLR.  And finally, while comparable models from Olympus, Nikon, Sony, and others may be a bit better or worse, similar limits exist with pretty much any point-and-shoot camera.Accepting those limits, the S5 is a great newbie's camera that "even a caveman can use" in the Auto mode five minutes after loading some batteries and an SD card -- then play with later to learn about Aperture and Shutter priorities, exposure compensation, spot metering, ISO and bokeh.  Since I'm a good ways along that learning curve, my S5 serves as a DSLR companion that's now used when I want to travel light, just take some simple snapshots, or want to make a movie.  For those uses, it's a keeper and a definite 5-star performer within its limits.With the advent of the SX10, I think Canon's stopped production and sales of the S5.  But used ones are pretty widely available in the mid-$200 range.  Additionally, the earlier and not-too-different S3is has comparable performance and commonly sells used in the low to mid $100's.  As long as the camera's zoom lens functions (there are few other breakable moving parts), either could be a decent option for beginner or back-up.
$SUMMARY.: Great camera within its limits

$review_text.: I have been researching projectors for three months
 I settled on the w1070, but then I started comparing other projectors near this price range


 The reason I choose the Benq w1070 is that I can get a 100&#34; image at only 8'9&#34; back


 Secondly, lens shifting, and third, incredible online reviews

 I have researched way too much about projectors because I knew every complaint anyone has ever written about the W1070

 When I fired it up, I was stunned how good the picture looked


 I have a 55&#34; Panasonic Plasma and it looks like a 100&#34; plasma


 No rainbows, no noise, very even picture across the screen
 Colors were incredibly vibrant and images were sharp and very little fan noise


 I tweaked a few settings with the Wow video and the picture looked even better

 I am using an Elite 100H screen and the combination is awesome

 I haven't tried 3d yet, but I can't wait to check it out.

$review_text.: I'm using this light for photography, so I can't comment on the issues that people seem to be having with video.This light panel does a good job of providing a bit of fill light right where you need it
It's small enough to hide behind something, which makes it great for doing band photography in dark clubs

The light it gives off doesn't throw very far, but it's enough to give a soft glow to a subject, or at least provide a little assist for your autofocus.Construction seems a bit flimsy, but that's just first impressions


The hotshoe mount is plastic and flexes quite easily from side to side


The included plastic sheets slide into the unit via a nice cutout on the side, although they're fairly dark

The orange one makes the light more red than anything
I've gotten better results by using an actual CTO orange gel cut to size.All in all, it's a very handy little light that's small enough to slide into a camera bag and bust out where a flash would be overkill
A few things that I'd like to see would be a knob to control the intensity of the lights (rather than -/+ buttons) and the ability to mount it portrait-style

Other than that, solid unit that will benefit a lot of photographers who aren't quite ready to jump to strobist-style lighting, but still need a little extra light from time to time.

It fit easily into the case and the added hard screen protector really protects the iPod screen from the bumps and bruises it can be subjected to under normal everyday use.  The beltclip that comes with it is sturdy and works well, though I would have moved it more toward the bottom of the case.  It is too high on the case for me, but that is a matter of personal opinion.  The case has cutouts for all of the connectors on the iPod, including the hold button.  As far as style goes, this case just looks tough.  Some people may say that they feel this case doesn't have a very nice presentation, but I believe the case's looks fit with the level of protection it provides.  Overall, this is a great case and I would highly recommend it.

The Samsung met most of my criteria, however, I was not very pleased with the overall quality of sound from the speakers.  Granted in the past, I have had much more expensive audio systems and very good speakers.  I ended  up purchasing different front speakers and hooking up a powered subwoofer to the unit, definitely helped the sound.The thing I would really like to comment on is Amazon's excellent customer service.  I had a problem with the center speaker and asked if I could only return that speaker.  I was told I needed to return the entire unit which I really did not want to do.  So I contacted Samsung and was going to return only the center speaker.  Well before I could return the speaker, I received a new unit from Amazon and swopped the speakers and returned the other unit.  Thumbs up, great job happy customer.

$REVIEW.: I haven't tried all the features on this radio, but so far it's very good. Extremely solid with very clear sound and reception (mono - the radio only has one speaker). Very good battery life. About water resistance... I don't know about that. As a product designer there's a serious design flaw I can spot right away, and it's about water. Once you pick up the radio by it's handle, the battery compartment gets facing up. Frankly, the compartment will not keep water outside, even less if water is dripping from your hand in case of a shower to a facing up cheap battery compartment's cap. Inside the compartment there are a couple of holes that give direct access to the interior of the radio. Well... You do the math. The problem could have been prevented by using a simple water tight cap attached with screws. Lame. Anyway I'm still loving the device. I'll handle the water problem myself. It has a very readable green display and crank operation is very smooth. Solid antenna. Flashlight is bright indeed. I hope this helps.*** UPDATE ***I returned the FR1000 and purchased a FR500. The FR500 has all the attributes of the FR1000, but is solar (it works), has way better water protection and shortwave! Yeah I'm missing the two way radio thing, but is not such a big deal. The range is short anyway (~10 miles)I can always get a good receiver with the money saved in the FR500. Uff... now I'm in love indeed.

$REVIEW.: This headphone works great. It does exactly what I want it to do - provide nice clear audio. Either my husband or I tend to use this even when there are others in the room watching TV also. Blocks out surrounding noise, like talking children! Also, we don't have to turn on Closed Caption when watching because you hear exactly what you want to hear. I was very pleasantly surprised to hear things in the background of the movies - like birds, footsteps, etc. Things that are part of the audio, but you usually don't hear. Only problem - we only bought one, so we'll have to buy a second pair so both of us can use them at the same time. We have had this headphone for several months now. I like the volume control on the headphone and the battery power (rechargeable) lasts a long time - we've never had to return the headphone to the base while watching because of low battery. Just put it back to re-charge when you are not using them and they are always ready to go. I think the price is also very reasonable compared to other similar models - especially when you catch it on sale.
$SUMMARY.: Love these headphones!

$REVIEW.: This UPS is better than I expected in almost every way. It's completely silent when it's running, which means it can sit under my desk without annoying me. The 12 outlets are laid out beautifully, leaving plenty of room for small and larger plugs. The display backlight turns off after a bit, so no bright blue glow when the lights are off. The cord is plenty long and has a great angle plug which allows it to sit behind furniture. And the run time is more than adequate to allow me to save my unfinished work and turn off the computer when a power outage occurs (I got the 850VA unit). The software, which needs to be downloaded separately on the web site, is simple and seems to provide all the features I need. So far, all my computing equipment appears to run great while plugged into this unit, so in that regards I'm a very satisfied customer.My only real gripe comes from the so-called "EcoLogic" branding. The packaging prominently features the color green to emphasize this point. There's all kinds of purported "energy savings" claims printed on the box. And when I open the box to remove the UPS, I find... 2 enormous blocks of styrofoam? So much for "EcoLogic"...my Logitech keyboard came packaged solely in recycled cardboard, had all instruction manuals printed on the inside of the packaging, and left no trace of ecologically damning material behind when I was done with it.my Brother printer came packaged in fully recyclable materials and a large, re-usable canvas bag. No styrofoam in sight.Seems to me like you shouldn't be allowed to promote your product as being "green" and "ecologically friendly" when it comes wrapped in enormous styrofoam blocks. So one star deducted for marketing BS.

$review_text.: Purchased this radio to replace one I had dropped (one too many times) and finally broke. This radio has the best reception I have ever experienced.  I am able to get all stations clearly inside my large metal garage.  The display is very easy to read and the buttons are large so you can change the station without taking off your gloves. I carry it to where ever I am working, so the batteries and sturdy handle are very useful. Speaker is very clear and has nice volume control.

$REVIEW.: I was expecting an easy to use arm that would accomodate all of my reflectors, small as well as large ones. Unfortunately, the smallest reflector this arm will hold is 25" accross. The arm is also difficult to adjust and not as flexible as I would like. You have to exert allot of force to get it to a vertical position. However, the construction and quality is really good and for large reflectors it works well.

$review_text.: This is the best MP3 and audiobook player, and a whole lot more.But this 2GB is actually more expensive than the 4GB and nearly the same price as the 8GB so take a look there.Here is my review of my 16GB:This is the best audiobook player. I also have an Ipod 80GB Classic and had a Zen Vision M. It leaves both for dead.- superb sound quality.- excellent bookmark function- 256 bookmarks. It returns to the bookmark and continues to the follwing tracks (unlike Zen which just stops, as do many other players, and windows mobile players).- the touch screen is very nifty and the smart menus pop up nicely. Navigation quickly became intuitive.- the standard folder structure makes loading books and tracks very simple. I am over Itunes and do not miss it.- 16GB or 8GB or 4GB of internal memory, then an SD slot which means you can have as many SD cards as you want. bookmarks work on the current SD card no worries.- excellent for music albums.- the video function works well when I test it, although I am not interested in using it routinely.If you're looking for the best portable audiobook player, you've found it. But if you just want to listen to audiobooks on your computer get ViddyMP3 for free. Or if you want to tinker get Rockbox free software for various portable players. I think the D2 is great for music too as its sound is clearly superior to Ipod and Zen to even my untrained ear.It does not do playlists, but really who needs them? I mainly used to use them to work around Itunes bugs.(maybe I like compilation albums, but I can just compile a folder of MP3's any way I like).Wishlist- on the fly erase & click for more details on the bookmarks (but still the best for bookmarks), playlists (OK already).Tips- use the stylus supplied for navigating the touch screen.- when you first ever turn it on, be careful as the first thing you do is set language and I accidentally clicked Korean!! It took a while to return it to English, ha ha.- If you're not sure just buy the 4GB Black version only $100, and later expand it with an SD card.Note that Cowon also make the S9 which I have not seen. It is more expensive and uses a different screen technology.

$review_text.: As many know, the Wii can not output anything higher than 480p through component cables. This UP SCALES the 480p image into 720p or 1080p...it is not true HD, it is 480p cleaned up.For what it does, it does look good. Colours are brighter and more vibrant on Super Nintendo games, and there are less jagged edges on Nintendo 64 games and Wii games. Gamecube games and Wii games that utilize Prog. Scan really benefit from the up scaling.all in all, This is only recommended for people who can not use Component cables on their HDtv. If you want true 1080p from your Wii Games, use an Emulator.

$REVIEW.: This USB hub is a great way to add 7 additional ports to any computer or laptop. I have a ton of devices connected to my computer and I always need another USB port to plug in more devices (you can never have enough gadgets!) to either use or charge.I had no trouble connecting this and I was using it immediately to transfer large files and charge devices. I have had no issues with anything so far and am pleased with the data transfer rate (although I don't clock it, I can tell if it is lagging).It is powered by a plug and will take up one USB port while providing seven (for a total gain of six ports.A great device sure to fit on any desktop.I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review.

$REVIEW.: After deciding it was finally time to upgrade my old 240gb USB 2.0 portable hard drive - I settled upon this 500gb USB 3.0 hard drive. I found the small size perfect - it fits so well into my laptop bag that I sometimes have problems finding it. The performance upgrade from USB 2.0 to USB 3.0 is significant - I didn't see the promised USB 3.0 10x performance difference,  but I was able to move large amounts of data in mulitple folders containing over 100 GB of data (mostly music and photos) much, much quicker.In order to benefit from the performance of this hard drive your computer must have a USB 3.0 port. You can tell the difference between 2.0 and 3.0 ports because USB 3.0 ports will have the universal USB symbol with an SS (stands for SuperSpeed) in front of it. One thing to keep in mind is that the USB 3.0 cable is different from the USB 2.0 cable - at least the end of the cable that plugs into the hard drive. The end that plugs into your computer is the same and will work with USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 ports. So make sure you don't lose your 3.0 cable because they aren't yet ubiquitous.Overall this is a great drive at a good price. My one quibble is that the edges of the drive case aren't rounded which means that the edges and share are very boxy.

$review_text.: I use this battery pack for long distance flights.  It has been great.  I'm using it to charge my Motorola Android smartphone and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 tablet.  It has loads of power for both of these items.  I don't think I've completely drained it once yet despite 16 hr flights.  It takes a while to charge completely but that should be expected given its capacity.  It's very hard to find a comparable product with this capacity and that performs this well at this price point.  It actually works better than some of the more expensive products I've tried.

$REVIEW.: I begin by stating that the Apple product line is still far ahead of any competition


I love all of my many Apple/Mac products,especially my Ipad
 Instead of lauding the many great features and apps available for the iPad, I thought I would focus on a very important feature:  Traveling, by air or auto, is so much easier with the iPad than my Macbook Pro or my iPods


 The screen size is perfect
 It is easy to slip into a briefcase or backpack, and, when flying I don't have to worry about the flight attendants spilling drinks on it, and the rude passenger who reclines his seat in front of me without looking is not a problem because the iPad is easily moved and stowed


 This would seem unimportant to many, but this is a crucial point

 Add the other features (great apps, HD display, and excellent battery life make this or the newer gen 2s a good investment and a lot of fun

Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: This is our third Yamaha receiver.  We've had the first one for over 8 years and it continues to work flawlessly, it just didn't fit our new stereo cabinet.  This new unit was simple to connect (we're all Hdmi now) and simpler to control, even though it has more features than our old one.Same YPAO speaker setup, which we find indispensable as a first pass tuning-in of the speakers.  Surprisingly, the first pass was the only one needed -no additional tweaks required.  We're using this unit with two Yamaha front speakers and a Bose woofer pass through (non-powered, speaker wires run through woofer on way to front speakers, no seperate woofer connection).  YPAO had no problem with this arrangement.  Essentially this is a 2.0 setup and sounds great.Everything is channeled through this receiver - TV, DVD, cable box - all at 720 x 1080 with great picture and sound clarity.  Easy.Our other Yamaha is a 7.1 that we're using as a 5.1.  Same easy setup and great sound.  More features and yet still easy to control.

$review_text.: Very effective noise cancellation - been using it on airplanes - both because of the N/C electronics and the snug fit of the earpads to my head and ears (both large).  The fit is more snug than that of my 20 year old Sony MDR-V7 but plenty comfortable even after 2 hours.  The sound is especially pure with N/C switched on and somewhat subdued but usable with N/C switched off.  Plenty of good sound with reduced volume settings on all my audio devices including iPod and Creative flash player.  To me the value is in reduced ringing in my ears from the amount of flying I do, twice a week or more, and instead using the time to listen to podcasts and music.  I really am "dead to the world" with this thing on.

$review_text.: After receiving this case, I agree with most of the 4 and 5 star reviews.  The case looks good, is well constructed and appears that it will last well.  My only complaint (also mentioned by others that costs it my fifth star) is that after a week or two of usage, the top of the cover becomes stretched at the fold and does not align properly at close so that it will turn the screen off unless you pay specific attention to it.Also, even though the screen shuts off initially, a little bump or movement can cause the top to move and turn the screen on without noticing it.  About half of the time you open it to a locked screen.

Reading through some of the other reviews, they mention something about a 'Pure' option in the Video setup and I'll look for that.  This works great for switching between my PS3, cable and Roku HDMI inputs (with the exception of the video issues mentioned).  I also bought the bluetooth adaptor for this unit and, though it looks flimsy, it has worked very good so far for streaming Sirius from the App on my iPhone (particularly on Saturday mornings while listening to Click and Clack),  My next purchase will be a decent programmable remote so my wife can use the thing when I'm not around the house.

$review_text.: Pros: Physically the card does what it says when it works, dont expect it to work wonders but I was seeing some all around better pings and more importantly perfectly stable pings in BFBC2. Unless your rig is maxed out you might find that spending the money on a more vital component to be a more gratifying experience performance wise.Cons: Software package and support is laughable at best, their best response is "try older drivers". The first thing you'll notice is the card repeatedly telling you it's firmware and driver do not match and it will reflash, all will seem fine for a few power cycles but rest assured within a day or two on a cold boot it will give you the same message and then proceed to reflash the card. It's such a problem they even mention it in a popup message following the initial installation but they simply tell you to go to their forums for assistance where they will then tell you to try older drivers witch did nothing for me, the problem keeps coming back regardless of how many fresh formats and installations of windows i tried.Most importantly, if you own windows blinds or other stardock software do not purchase this card, the software package/drivers fail to function if windows blind is installed on your machine, it's a known problem that tech support will inform you of after you contact themOther Thoughts: The potential benefits of the card soon become outweighed by it's incompatibilities and driver/software package short comings, thankfully amazon has such a wonderful return policy.

This is much safer than attempting to navigate around your iPod while driving.The controller works wirelessly, so you're not taking a chance with lifting cords and getting tangled (though the supplied cord is longer than most will ever need, it can be gathered and tied up to be less obtrusive, and it stays near the device, not anywhere near the steering wheel).The steering wheel controller gives you easy access to the following functions : play/pause, forward, back and shuffle.The steering wheel controller is placeable anywhere on the wheel, it's completely customizable.This spiffy iPod accessory is compatible with the following iPod devices : iPod nano (1st, 2nd and 3rd gen), iPod (4th and 5th gen), iPod Classic, iPod iPhone and the iPod touch.Consider this item an investment in safe driving.

$REVIEW.: I bought a Samsung T220 (22 Inch) and it has a horrible viewing range. You wouldn't expect that on such a small TV. You literally have to be right on the TV or withing a 15 degree viewing angle of the screen to see anything. This wall bracket puts the TV at the right angle needed to have a great picture from pretty much the average seating positions around the TV

$REVIEW.: I purchased this receiver in order to set up a home theatre. It is replacing my 30-year old Onkyo receiver which is still great! Unfortunately my 30-year old receiver has no home theatre capabilities, so it was time for an upgrade. ;-)I am using this receiver to switch my HDMI and Component inputs; my DVD player and cable box outputs connect to the receiver, with the receivers HDMI output connecting to the TV input. I have 5 speakers (2 front, center channel, and 2 surround) connected to the receiver, with my front speakers being 30-year models that I purchased with my previous Onkyo receiver.The only 'negatives' that I would have about the receiver is the complexity of the manual and the remote control. If you are a 'techie', its not too difficult to figure your way around to set things up and use it on a daily basis. Otherwise, I recommend you get a 'techie' to help you out.

$REVIEW.: Use it as a sata dock or as a standalone duplicator. It takes about 90 minutes to duplicate a drive and works fine with either 2.5" or 3.5" drives. What more can I say?My only complaint is that it copies from drive 2 to drive 1 and you'll need a magnifying glass to read the labels that tell you this. Also, when you push the button to change to standalone operation, you have to hold it down for a few seconds.No regrets though.

$REVIEW.: **Looks like the price on this has gone from $29.99, which is what I paid, to $39.99**I got a pretty good deal on this bundle. I own the Kindle Touch wifi and all the items here fit it well. This is great for having an extra wall charger, car charger, headphones, reading light, as well as a few other nice to haves. I primarily bought this for the screen protector and a protective folding case. The screen protector was a disappointment. It states it's anti glare (a sticker on the packaging also claims it's for the kindle touch). Be forewarned, it's not any less anti glare than other screen protectors that do not make this claim. It fits the screen wonderfully, so you will need to be extra careful not to scratch the screen when you remove it (since you probably will go ahead and try it anyway and realize the protective screen really detracts from your reading experience ;)).Everything else on here is as described. The folding case has pockets for id's and credit cards/business cards. These sit right over the kindle screen and may put pressure on it if you decide to use them much.The quality of the items isn't of the highest caliber, but it's OK for what it is. Some of these items look and feel like they came from the dollar store right down to the packaging. For the record, I charged my Kindle using this charger and neither item burst into flames. The wall charger has a bright green light on it. It could almost double as a nightlight, so you may not want to leave it on all night long in a bedroom if a little light bothers you. I tried the headphones and didn't go deaf and they sound better than the ones you get on an airplane. The stylus pen also works with my cell and tablet. For what it's worth, $30 on this is a fair purchase, but I wouldn't pay more for it.

$review_text.: ***Probably my final edit of this review - I really don't think anyone is reading this anyway!  :)***It's only been a month or so since my last update on this review.  I dropped my rating from 5 to 3 stars and gave Garmin a pretty good put down. About a week ago there was an update to the workings of the watch and I feel that I need to address it in this review.I complained about the ANT (Almost Never Transfers) system being very sketchy at best.  The new system completely eliminated the ANT program and now uses "Garmin Express".  I want to add in that there had been a firmware update available for my watch for a fair amount of time, but I will never know if it would have solved my problem because I was never able to transfer anything "to" the watch.  So it was impossible to update the firmware until this latest revision.  I was sort of amazed when it actually updated and fairly skeptical of the outcome.  The first time I used the watch after the update the Garmin Express worked flawlessly.  Day 2 if failed, though...  it only failed once and worked on a second attempt which still put me ahead of the previous norm in terms of time.  It has worked every time since without fail.  (Probably 6 or 7 days now, my previous record was 3 days in a row of first attempt uploads.)  Twice in the last few days it has actually uploaded my run BEFORE I got to the computer.  This is how I expected (and I believe it was intended) it to work from day 1.However, the update on the "New" Garmin Connect is little more than a coat of paint.  It is obviously intended just to look new, but essentially you'll be working with the same two or three spreadsheets with the same capabilities as before.  It's kind of like painting your house and then claiming it is a new house...I've thought about this and I'm not going to change my rating.  In my opinion, it is now working as it should have worked from day 1.  I've used this watch for close to two years and it wasn't brand new when I got it.  I feel that if Garmin wants to keep (or get) customer confidence they need to release projects that are ready for release and not use paying customers as beta testers.  The glitches, and with any product there will be glitches, should be minor for the most part and the fixes should come much more quickly.  I'm a function over form type of guy...  make it work better not look better.  I never cared how it looked in the first place.  07/02/2014Review Edited after a year and a half of use, reduced from 5 star to 3 star***I am updating this review and dropping it to 3 stars after a year and a half of use.  The update begins here.After a year and a half and 261 entries into Garmin Connect I find myself feeling that I needed to revisit this review.  Let me preface the change by stating that I still love the watch and what it does.  From the time I start running until the time I arrive back at my computer it is nearly flawless.Primarily my issue is that uploading the data to Garmin Connect is frustrating at best.  It started out bad and I found a process that seems to work about 60% of the time, but that is the best I hope for.  When I arrive home, I delete my run.  I unplug the ANT.  I open the window for Garmin Connect and change it from "Pair with new devices - disabled" to "enabled".  At this point I turn to the watch and negotiate the 3 levels of menus necessary to access the pairing and enable pairing.  At this point I plug the ANT back in and back 3 levels out to the history option on the first level and tell it to "transfer all".  At this point I cross my fingers and hope for the best.  Twice this week, after 30 seconds to a minute, a prompt comes up on the computer asking me if I want to connect to the watch, I tell it yes, the same prompt comes up on the watch and I tell it yes and my data actually uploaded.  I'm lucky to have that happen more than 2 or 3 times a week.  Occasionally, when I tell the watch to accept, it does and then the upload just fails.  Occasionally, it tries to upload without asking me for permissions and that always fails.  It'll say uploading for a half hour, but it never finished.  (I've taken a shower and returned to the same message.)  When that happens I have to shut down the entire ANT agent program and turn off the watch, restart both and start the whole process all over.  I've had many days where it actually took me longer to upload my run than it took me to do the run.  It reminds me of the first generation wireless routers... they were great when they worked, but highly inconsistent.  I've decided that ANT actually stands for Almost Never Transfers.  For about a month I've been tracking how many days in a row it actually connects on the first try and so far my record streak is 2 days.  You can't imagine how much I wish they'd left a way to just plug it in.For about the last three months the heart rate monitor has been "glitching".  I'll go out on a run and it'll show my heart rate as around 220 bpm for the first 5 minutes or so of my run.  Considering that my normal max is under 190 in a race and I generally average in the low 150's, I don't believe the data. I figure I need to buy a new strap.  I love the heart rate function, but the 5 minutes of ridiculously high rates skews my data and makes the entire strap essentially worthless.  This puts me in the position of questioning whether I want to drop $50 on a new strap and continue to deal with almost daily frustration I experience with the sub-par uploading issues described above.  However, if I choose to start over with a new brand, thanks to the proprietary nature of the garmin data, I'd lose 260+ runs worth of data that can only be seen on Garmin Connect.  Which brings me to Garmin Connect:Garmin Connect is good with a shining beacon of "but it could be so much better".  First of all it gives you charts.  The top chart is a pacing chart that shows your pace throughout the run.  However, as an example, tonight I ran 4 miles.  My individual miles were all between 7:50 and 7:39.  If you look at the chart though, it charts this run showing a range of pace from 0 to 30:00 minutes per mile.  This renders all my pace changes into a roughly straight, but slightly wavy line that is essentially useless.  The second chart is an elevation chart.  This is also useless because the Garmin is just not that accurate in terms of elevation.  I can do an out and back run and split it in half and the second half is different than the first half.  Also, if I run the same course multiple times (I do often) it almost never shows the same elevation changes.  On the main page it shows an "elevation gain" column (I'm not sure how it calculates this) and the 4 miles I ran tonight it gives me a gain of 246.  The last two times I ran this course I got 176 and 344.  It's just not really accurate enough to be worthwhile.The last chart is the heart rate.  This is the only one that has ever been even remotely useful, but now with the glitching even it is limited.They also give you a split chart with an average pace column.  I cannot believe that whoever designed it put any real thought into it.  Tonight on my 4 mile run it shows:1  7:40.4  1.00  7:402  7:49.7  1.00  7:503  7:39.7  1.00  7:404  7:44.2  1.00  7:445  :01.1  0.00  4:2030:55.1  4.00  7:43Ok, why do I need that average pace column on the right?  I guess if I set it to take splits in something other than mile increments it might have some use, but as is it's nothing but a rounding column.  I'd love to have a total elapsed time to be able to see my 2 and 3 mile splits.  Wouldn't that make sense?  I've been running long enough to do them in my head, but why should I have to.  It wouldn't be that difficult to put that in.I'm still debating my course, but I'm probably going to have to make a decision about buying a new heart rate strap or a new watch.  If it's a new watch I could try the new garmin 620, but I've read it has very similar connection issues.  From the sounds of it, just like the 310xt that I have.  Not everyone has issues, so do I roll the dice and hope I get lucky with another watch and keep my data or scrap the whole thing and start from scratch?  I'll probably decide closer to summer when I'll start racing more often.So, why the 3 stars?  I decided that I'm still giving it 5 stars for tracking my run.  Tonight I doubled back on a road and switched sides (I like to run on the left side of the road when possible) and the watch actually shows that I switched sides.  For over a year the heart rate monitor did a fantastic job as well.  I understand that the strap is subject to wear and tear more so than the watch itself and if it weren't for the other issues I'd buy another in a second and not think twice.  I'm giving the ANT agent and Garmin connect a 1 star evaluation for the reasons stated above and that averages out to 3 stars.If you buy this watch (or any other garmin watch) I truly hope you are lucky and don't run into any of the issues I have and thanks for taking the time to read my review.**This is where the update ends - my original review follows**Wow.  I was a competitive runner for many years up until around 2000.  It is amazing where technology has gone in the last 12 years.  The days of getting splits off your 8 lap memory ironman triathlon watch are dead and gone.  I've been using the garmin 310xt for about 3 weeks now.  I am no longer racing, I'm more of a recreational jogger right now, but for either this is such a neat device.  I have not read any scientific analysis about it's accuracy or capabilities, but let me tell you what I've seen:It connects to satellites and follows your run pretty much wherever you go.  On the garmin connect site you can choose road map or satellite and literally look at a map or the actual terrain of your run with a red line showing your path and "stick pins" indicating the start and finish.  It automatically gets mile splits for you. (could be set for kilometers if you preferred.)  It indicates your pace per mile as you are running and tracks your elevation during the run.  If you have the optional heart rate monitor (I do), it also keeps track of your heart rate as you run.When you complete your activity (I haven't gone out on a bike ride with it, but I have no reason to believe it would work any differently.) the garmin connects to your computer and uploads all the information then sends it to the garmin connect site which serves as your training log as well as allowing you to compare runs and courses while tracking all this data.  Wow, I would have loved to have had something like this when I was running marathons!  It is, without question, an amazing piece of technology.How accurate is it?  From what I've seen, and for what I do, it is pretty darn good.  Would I bet my life that a mile measured by the garmin is exactly 1,760 yards?  No!  But would I bet $5 that it's as close as driving the route with my car like I used to do.. absolutely!  If I need (or want) dead on exact distances I'll go up to the track and run there.  For my road runs, the garmin is more than sufficient.  I have run a couple of my old courses that I had guesstimated distances on and the garmin so far tends to tell me that I was long on most of them.  (My old 2 mile run is more like 2.1 according to the garmin.)The heart rate is new to me.  I've never dealt with one before.  I'd really appreciate any experts thoughts on what I say here....  So far, my average rates for all my runs have been between 164 and 169.  Given such a narrow range, my bet is that it's pretty accurate... (if I got a 350 avg, I'd know there was some sort of glitch.)  It also tracks the highest rate you hit during your activity and those have been between 179 and 188.  I am a 6' tall, 160 lb, 42yr old man.  According to most things I've seen so far I'm averaging over what should be my max heart rate...  Let me add that I'm not killing myself on these runs, I'm just trying to get into a little bit better shape, so I'm not doing speed work or fartleks or even any big hills, just jogging.  Anyway, for the review... it seems accurate to me.The bad:-It's huge and orange!  lol, don't think that this is a petite watch, it's not.  I honestly don't care, I've never been into the "fashion" aspect of sports.-Lack of directions.  The directions in the box are very bare bones, the absolute minimum you need to get started.  It also comes with a cd with a .pdf file that has more detailed instructions, but even those are, in my opinion, inadequate.  I can see on the garmin connect site that there are many things that the garmin is capable of, but I can't figure out how to do it and the instructions either don't cover it at all or not well enough to get the job done.  I have not called customer support, but I've read in many reviews that customer support is awful... and so far I've managed to work around most of my issues and I don't want to turn this into a bad experience unless I absolutely have to.-Wireless connecting.  I'm not sure if it is a battery issue, a user issue, or a design issue, but the garmin seems to default to "pairing off" and the program on the computer seems to default to "disable pairing".  This meant that in my first few runs it took me longer to upload the run than it took me to do the run.  First it took me a while to realize that I needed to "enable pairing" on the computer and also on the watch after every run.  To me, I feel that the default should be to pair.  Why turn it off...? Do a lot of people get their watches hacked and their pace per miles stolen???  Like I said, maybe it's a battery issue, but the instructions didn't tell me (or I missed it) that it would default back to off on the computer and the watch after every run.-Next I had the antenna plugged into a usb port on the back of the computer which seemed to make the connection very tenuous. (It worked from there once, then wouldn't work again.)  I moved the antenna to the front where I can lay the watch on the desk inches from the antenna and that has helped, but it still doesn't "find" the watch 100% of the time.  I now have a system that seems to work for me most of the time:  I come in, clear the data from the watch by pressing reset for 4 seconds.  Enable pairing on the computer.  Enable pairing on the watch.  Tell the watch to send data and usually within the first three or so tries it will connect and upload the data.  On the whole this is such an amazing piece of equipment that I am very disappointed that the instructions don't better cover uploading the workouts and that a watch that can use satellites to track me for miles from space can't seem to find an antenna 5 inches away.  I'd almost rather it just plugged in to a usb cable and eliminated the wireless entirely.Why 5 stars...? honestly, in spite of a few frustrating moments trying to get it to connect to the computer it is still massively impressive to me.  It wasn't cheap, but I'm enjoying playing with it and it's even making me consider trying to get back into racing shape... but we'll see on that one.  If you would buy one, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have and I hope you have better luck than I did with the pairing.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.

$review_text.: I had no &#34;bounce&#34; issues, not too tight, not too loose, and the the angle is perfect. But why oh why does just docking or undocking interrupt so many apps???? It's crazy but some completely crash, some reload from start, and any streaming app ceases upon a dock or undock. These things don't happen when you plug in the USB charger, so they don't have to happen when you dock. But for now, they do. It may be that future firmware could fix this terribly annoying thing. But if you can live with the interruptions, this dock is everything else I hoped it would be.You'll want to buy a long Micro-USB cable and maybe a new AC adapter too, as this does not come with any, and the stock Nexus charge cable isn't long enough for convenient locations.

$REVIEW.: Whew! This piece of state of the art machinery is a sight to behold. It's very simple to set-up, but tedious if you don't know what you're doing.I paired this up with a Toshiba A3 player, and the sound/image is pristine!I have not used the mic to synch up the sound levels, I've just done it manually. I have to get used to it before I get too much into it. Lots of inputs/outputs, but my favorite feature so far are the THX DTS sound fields.This thing kicks like a horse, and the volume isn't even turned up all that high, which means it has a powerful amp built in--with lots of power to go around. This baby is giving my JBL and Infinity speaker system a good workout.The receiver is THX certified, so that's a plus.Anyways, you owe it to your ears to add this badboy to your hi-def viewing adventures.

$REVIEW.: This is a great camera, fast shooting speeds manual mode has tonnes of features. Great Pictures too. This is really a unique design and the interface is fast. The pop out flash was an interesting touch too.Although I didn't really notice any difference witht he Shake Reduction. And this was a refurbished item, but I think there was a little too much dents and scratches that I'd hoped for. Doesn't do as well in dark environments as some other cameras.All in all I cannot complain about the camera itself, got it dirt cheap since it's a refurb but it's just because of the excess scratches that I couldn't give it a 5/5.

$REVIEW.: I purchased two monitors to run in a dual configuration

 I saw some reviews stating they had difficulty with swiping in Windows 8 from the edges


 I also experienced this when I first installed them; however, once you calibrate the screens it works just fine

 The first calibration has touch/calibration points at the very edge of the screen (4 in each corner to touch) and it was hard to get it to accept the touch points along the edges


 Once it was calibrated, I ran the calibration again and on the 2nd try there were fewer calibration points, which were away from the edges

 After the 2nd calibration run, everything worked perfectly and I had no problems swiping the menus, closing apps, etc.Picture clarity is very good and there are not as many smudges on the screen as I get with my Surface tablet
 Overall a very good buy considering the price.

$REVIEW.: I bought this from Electronics Expo through Amazon.  The total price was about $600 than Best Buy.  The delivery went smoothly and the driver was great he helped set it up even though he was not required to.The TV is a very good buy.  Like most, I looked at the plasmas and LCDs.  My HP DLP went belly up after only four years.  I did not want to spend a ton of money but I wanted a BIG screen.  I had heard of the LED technology in this TV and for the price decieded to get it.I have had it for about a month now and love it.  I am not as picky as some.  I can't tell you about any of the nuances but I can say the picure is very good and I did not have to adjust a thing to have a great picture.  I was tempting to give it a four becuse the sound was not as good as my HP TV had been.  But knowing that most people end up putting in a home theater sound system with most big screens, I ignore some of the audio short falls.  The sound is fine, it just is not ear blowing.For the price I don't think you can ever do any better.

$REVIEW.: After messing around with cheaper earbuds in an effort to save money, I just tacked on additional costs and wished I'd bought these first and saved myself the hassle

 These are easily the best-sounding earbuds I've ever heard, and the way they rest in your ear is perfectly comfortable and natural
 You don't have to jam anything into your ear canal, the rest comfortably in the natural curve just outside your ear canal
 You can barely feel them 





they seem to float in place.Prior to this, every set of earbuds I owned would fall out of my ears
 The Etymonic pair I just returned need to be jammed into your ear canal to work, which hurt and still sounded terrible

 Must not have fit me right


 The wrap-around your ear kind seemed to either still have a need to jam earbuds into your ears and would constantly fall out, or just sounded terrible.These actually sound amazing!  Like 





well, premium speakers
 Awesome bass 


 .
not &#34;booming,&#34; but that that area of the soundscape has truly been addressed and it just sounds good


They get plenty loud
 They give you the best part of wearing headphones 





allowing you to hear stuff you seem not able to pick up on when listening using conventional speakers.What a treat
 I'm listening to some Beastie Boys funk on them right now


 Do yourself a favor, stop messing around, and enjoy quality sound again in an era when sound quality has gone down the tubes.

$review_text.: I purchased this item from Amazon and am using it with a Sony NWZZ818BLK MP3 player to work with a factory AM/FM stereo in my new F-250.I am experiencing distortion and hiss at the high end with my MP3 volume set at approximately 70% as directed by the instructions.  Once I reduce my MP3 volume to around 30%, the audio sounds fine, but I then have to crank the vehicle radio to its limit.  I have another vehicle that I connect my MP3 to via a cassette adapter, and it sounds just fine.  So I believe the distortion is a result of the FM transmitter.  I will hold onto this transmitter though because it will cost too much to have an aftermarket stereo installed.

$REVIEW.: I received this bag for free as part of a bundle promotion with a Canon T3i.  This was my first backpack-style camera bag and I was very impressed with the functionality and flexibility of this style of bag.  The dividers in the bag are all removable, which means that you can customize the main compartment to suit your needs.  I can easily carry a camera with zoom lens attached, a couple of extra lenses, a mini tripod, a viewfinder loupe, and an assortment of chargers, batteries, and memory cards &#8211; and that's just in the main compartment.  There are handy &#8211; if not particularly well-protected &#8211; compartments on the side, which are good for spare batteries or microfiber cloths and there are lots of pockets for small tools and accessories.  I don't find the tripod loops on the side particularly useful, but it's nice that they're there.Unfortunately, after having the bag for just over a year, the top handle unexpectedly failed &#8211; one half of it pulled right off when I tried to pick up the bag.  This does not change the core functionality of the bag itself, but it is inconvenient and I worry a little about the long-term reliability of the backpack in general.  I do understand that this is a natural weak spot &#8211; it's both the smallest handle and the one that probably gets used the most.  Still, it seems like it should have been reinforced a little more, since it failed so suddenly (and without warning).That being said, I would still recommend the bag &#8211; it's a great value, especially if you can get it discounted or as part of a promotion, and it's very well-designed and functional.  Just be careful when picking it up.
$SUMMARY.: Very handy, good price, so-so construction

$REVIEW.: I had this trackball for 2 years with an XP machine and no problems.Best trackball ever - not too big and glides well.  When I got a Vista machine it would automatically stop working after a few power downs.  I have to keep the computer plugged into a surge protector and as long as the power stays on, the mouse is fine.  But if I power goes out from a storm, then I have to unplug the trackball wireless module and either re-install or hope it decides to work again.  My computer just went into standby and the mouse was not working anymore again.  I had to re-install it again.  I've checked my bios power settings and the vista power settings. There is not much else I can do.  DON'T use this for Vista is all I can say.  It crashes all the time and doesn't like other USB devices except my keyboard & printer.  New Vista drivers don't help either.  Great for XP.

In fact, it comes formatted as two partitions (drives), and a program called SanDisk Cruze is installed on the first partition - which takes up space that you could otherwise use.  The program also causes a Mac to crash, Win7 to crash, and Win XP to freeze.  You're essentially buying something that causes you grief rather than helps you.  2GB isn't a whole lot to start with, but after they install their UNREMOVABLE programs, you don't even have 2 GB left.  And yes, the preinstalled programs are unremovable. You can't even reformat the zip drive. You are stuck with games and other junk that just takes up space.

$review_text.: I have tried several keyboard, mouse, trackball stand-alones and combos and I have to say that this one from Logitech is one of the best I have used with my Windows OS home theater setup.Pros:-Small, lightweight, compact keyboard/touchpad combo package-Logitech quality, durability, and support-Logitech Unifying Receiver (allowing for multiple devices to by synced to one receiver)-Great for Windows-based Home Theater use-Windows button for easy Start Button (Win XP & 7) and Start Screen (Win 8) access-Windows 8 gesture support-Excellent battery lifeCons:-Recessed touchpad SOMEWHAT difficult to use with Windows 8 - but not impossible-Non-dedicated Home and End buttons for more difficult word processing accessibility (but not being a full-sized keyboard, this is understandable and does has this capability using the FN and directional arrow keys)Of course, the best feature of this device is the integrated touch pad that works well with any Windows-based home theater setup. I will say that when used in conjunction with my Win 8 PC, the recessed nature of the trackpad doesn't allow for easy use of the top-down and left/right-swipe features integrated into the Win 8 OS, but it is manageable with practice. These Win 8 OS gesture features CAN be used on this device's touchpad, but not without being VERY deliberate with ensuring you are touching right at the very edge of the recessed touchpad.If you've used these features on a touch screen tablet or Logitech's Rechargeable Touchpad T650 with your PC, then you can appreciate the functionality and ease of using the top/left/right swipe to access the various menus the Win 8 OS offers, but the physically recessed touchpad on this keyboard/touchpad combo makes it a little more difficult to manipulate - but not impossibly so.There is also a nifty &#34;left-mouse&#34; button at the upper left corner of the unit that makes two-handed operation of this device easy and intuitive. Just grip the keyboard combo with both hands, one at the left side, the other at the right, and use your right thumb to navigate using the touchpad, and your left thumb to click on the desired icons, etc. using the &#34;left mouse&#34; button in the upper left corner of the keyboard. Easy as that!!Overall, this combo device is a great addition to any PC-based home theater system and the Logitech Unifying receiver makes the setup process a breeze. Also, battery life is outstanding and should last for many months with regular use.I hope that in future designs of this keyboard, Logitech should make the surface of the touchpad level with the surface of the keyboard body (like most modern laptops). This would make it more easy to use with the Win 8 gestures.Again, this makes for a great KB/mouse combo for any PC and/or home theater setup!

Of course, all of my primes and slow zooms fit as well. It is a bit tight over the viewfinder hump, but not to the point that it stresses the seam or hinders the cushioning effect of the neoprene.This is not a quick-access case when used with an OM-D. It will take a few seconds, at least, to get the camera out and ready to go. I snipped off and fused the internal attachment strap because I don't use it.

The mounting clip DOES fit the Oregon, but the charging cable connection to the Oregon is obstructed by the the bend direction of the the connection (bends 180 degrees in the wrong direction to fit properly!).  My understanding is that there is a cable that is specifically made for the Oregon (and I would guess that THAT cable would not fit the Colorado!).  The mounting system itself works as advertised however, and I will be using that for road trips.  I ordered a new Oregon specific cable to replace that part of the vehicle mounting system.

$REVIEW.: This KVM works well. It's simple and easy to set up. To address some of the other reviews on this product, I've had no issues waking up my PCs out of standby and it hasn't yet locked up on me. Nor have I found any issues with regards to video. Note that there is no audio support and no switching supported via key presses (you have to press the button on the unit itself). That said, it's a cheap, reliable product that does its job well.One caution though... take note that this product uses only 1 USB plug for each computer that it's hooked up with. Thus, it serves as a type of 2-port hub. This is very convenient in one sense, as it doesn't hog up your available USB ports. You just have to be sure that the port has enough power for the switch (which does light up when your computer is on), your keyboard, and the mouse. I have a Logitech Illuminated Keyboard and an iGesture Touchpad that I used with this device and I had a lot of issues initially with the Touchpad not being recognized or only working for a brief interval. What I discovered was that the power provided by my PC's USB port was not enough for both devices. If I disabled the lighting on my keyboard, both devices worked great... once I turn up the lighting, the touchpad became erratic and eventually stopped working. I was able to resolve the issue by piping the USB plug through a powered hub (thus ensuring there was maximum power going through the single plug) and the problem went away. The point being, that while this device is convenient b/c of it only requires 1 USB plug and no external power, just take note that this might not work directly if you have some sophisticated equipment.IOGear also has a similar looking KVM product with a remote switch that I recently purchased as well (seeIOGear GCS22U 2-Port USB KVM Switch). That product DOES have two separate USB plugs and thus, is not susceptible to the same issue. However, the remote is the only way to switch the connections and the nature of how that remote is connected scares me somewhat as it can be easily smashed or the cable can be easily frayed or cut. However, if the remote switch is important or you'd prefer dedicated plugs for both the keyboard and mouse to each PC, then that would be the better choice instead of the product reviewed here.Bottom line, for under $20, it's a worthwhile investment if your needs are simplistic.

$REVIEW.: I bought this hard drive as a gift to someone who had to carry a lot of videos and pictures after a vacation

This was not my first BUFFALO hard drive though

This company seems to make good hard drives


It is strong and solid


It does what it is supposed to do by holding stored data
The other thing I like on this hard drive is the connection
It used to be unique and hard to find (cables) but not anymore

I like this hard drive.

$review_text.: I had an E11, which was very nice. However I sent it back after learning I would benefit more with the DAC/amp, and reading the many positive reviews for the E17, it was a no-brainer.Micca handled the transaction smoothly while pocketing a punitive restocking fee...thanks guys.I don't geek-out too much on tech specs or audiophile speak, but I don't mind saying the E17 has improved my music listening pleasure to where I can't rip my CD collection fast enough.Addendum: It has locked up on me twice, but each time it cranked right up after actuating the nearly microscopic reset button with a fine stringer's awl (sewing needle should work also).

$REVIEW.: I just got a new MacBook Pro (older i7's) and I needed this to run some presentations. I bought it from Amazon (not a third party fullfilled by Amazon, not a third party, just Amazon) and it arrived quickly using free shipping. I was surprised how easily it worked, even on Windows! It literally is plug and play. Connect the Displayport to your Mac and the VGA cable to the VGA port. Once both are plugged in, the Mac adjusts itself for the best configuration. Easy as that! The only (very) minor issue is that if you shift the adapter around too much, the signal will be temporarily lost, but will restore itself quickly.I have not experienced any issues after two months of usage. Connections are solid. Recommended for anybody with a Mac!

$REVIEW.: I have ordered 2 of these power adapters already, and am fixing to replace another one.  It seems strange that they will make the cameras so durable, and the power adapters so cheaply.  They don't hold up to outside weather at all.  You basically need to enclose these in a weather-tight environment for them to last more than three or four months. I realize they aren't real expensive, but this is my third one at $15 ea (including shipping).  That's $45 I am out for replacement power adapters now.  That is 1/2 the cost of a new camera. I'm hoping this one lasts a little longer.

$REVIEW.: I've recently committed to phasing out my disposable batteries and building a collection of good quality rechargeable units (2 young kids and a house full of electronic gadgets ensures frequent battery turnover). I purchased these Bluecell cases and some Powerpax Storacell battery caddys at the same time. The Bluecell case is a good solution for eliminating that bunch of loose batteries rolling around in whatever storage container you use. I don't typically carry batteries with me - so I can't comment on utilizing the glow in the dark feature of these cases (all of my batteries are stored in a single covered box all of the time).These cases are solid and the latch is strong...in fact it can be a bit of a PITA to open at times..leading to a bunch of dropped batteries after popping it open with too much effort (no doubt some type of user error on my behalf).I preferred the Storacell caddys over the Bluecell holders. The Storacells do not require the opening of a case and I found it easier to insert & remove batteries from the Storacells. This isn't a knock on the Bluecells - they're good value for the price...it's just a matter of personal preference.

$REVIEW.: Arctic does it again! Cooling an i7-3770 on a P8Z77-I Deluxe/WD mini-itx motherboard inside a Bitfenix Prodigy case, I get 28-30C idle and 37-40C full load. The noise level is more than acceptable; however, the fan can ramp up on full load but still is at an acceptable level.Installation was an absolute breeze. But, there was only one caveat. Which was does the fan blow? Most people, including myself, would have thought the air is blown out the side with the specification sticker. Nope, nada, wrong. On this fan the blade design is backwards, meaning it will blow air out the opposite side the specification sticker. After I made this correction, I got the temperatures stated above. With it blowing in the incorrect orientation I was still getting good temperatures. How about that?Mine had a little packaging damage like a few of the fins were bent and loose. But overall Arctic's quality control did a good job.Amazon's Prime, in typical fashion, was quick and great.

$REVIEW.: I can fit my 40D, three lenses (one mounted), extra battery, AC adapter and cords in this bag, with room to spare for filters, the user's manual, and other small items in the outside pockets. I put the camera with one mounted lens on one end, face down, supported by the hinged cushioned dividers. There's room outside these dividers (between which the mounted lens belongs) for the lens caps and extra battery. My two unmounted lenses fit vertically along one side of the remaining space, leaving the other half for adapter and cords -- and as a temporary space for switching lenses. There's a flat pocket at the front of the bag that's perfect for the user's manual and any other flat item such as lens papers. That still leaves the two box-shaped pockets on either side. And it's all very snug.

$REVIEW.: I've tried few other car stereos likeSony CDX-GT700HD,Pioneer DEH-P9400BHbefore this one. And this one by far exceeds all of them, both in pros & cons (unfortunately).I was little wary of touchscreen's responsiveness, ease of UI and resolution of the screen (since we're all spoiled by the AMOLEDs and Retinas and Gorilla Glass displays). For the price, I would say this meets and then exceeds the expectation a little bit. UI is good, has fast & responsive menus, well laid out options, easy to access and it even stores secondary levels of HD Radio (you can store a HD2 station as your favorite and it'll connect to that instead of connecting to the main station and then you having to go and change it to HD2 or HD3).There is one serious drawback which may or may not be as serious to you - the constant hissing noise. GT700HD had none (it had only wired connection, no Bluetooth), DEH 9400 had this issue only with Bluetooth mode and you have to turn the volume really high to hear that. For this unit however, as soon as you go beyond level 10-12, you can hear it without a mistake. And the worst part is, the hissing noise stays even with the audio, taking away some of crispness of the sound.Pioneer support indicated that this could be fault in the unit, so I'm going for a replacement. I'll update this review if the next one doesn't have this issue.If not for the noise, this unit would received 4 stars from me. Not 5 because the App Mode doesn't do much, UI resolution could have been made a little better, and overall, the unit could have had a far better UI (like the AppRadio2 version). The other quirk is that when in wired mode, 10-12 level of volume is loud, whereas in BT mode, you'd have to go double of that for the same level. So if you're switching between BT and wired, you may be in a for a rude shock!

$review_text.: This DVD/CD player is a good value. The picture isn't the best I've ever seen, but it's quite watchable. It's clear and bright. The volume was set at maximum when I got it, so beware when you turn it on the first time. The up side of that is that I could hear everything clearly in spite of a slight hearing loss. It's not full, rich sound-- this is enough to get you through a movie and know what's going on. It's not going to blow you away with realistic sound, but you can plug in some headphones if you want fuller sound. I like that you can play movies while the lid is closed. I can listen to my favorite shows at the office kind of like radio. It feels solid, looks sleek and is easy to carry.It was easy to just take it out of the box and start playing. You'll probably be familiar with most of the commands, but if you want to get full flexibility, you'll need to look at the manual. I don't like to rely on a battery, and I don't watch stuff while I'm driving, but I think most people do. I think this should have included an adapter for the car, because the battery lasts less than two hours-- and a lot of movies are longer than that. Travelling with this thing would be a bummer if you ran out of juice right before the end of every movie. The other drawback is that I have to push buttons on the remote at least twice to get it to work. It's not responsive as it could be, and that can be irritating.Overall this is a good, solid player for home use, and good for a kid's room or in an office. I just think the remote needs to be more responsive and that a car adapter would make it a five star product.

The memory card is so much faster than my 4 year old 512MB card, even though I am storing 4 to 6 MB pics on the 12 megapixel SD950 rather than 2 MB pics on my old 5 megapixel model.I have owned many Sandisk flash products with no failures or trouble, so I trust that it will be reliable.  I did not think I would use the included reader much, but to my surprise, it came to the rescue at an opportune time.  I was visiting a friend and I wanted a copy of the photos that he had shot at one of our previous outings.  I happened to have the USB reader with me in my camera case, so I popped the memory card out of the camera and into the reader, then into his PC - instant flash drive.

$REVIEW.: I've had a couple of Spyder monitor calibration tools. They have improved the consistency of my photo printing. I don't get any surprises now when I compare my photos on my computer with the prints I make or have printed. I work off a Macbook Pro and a Dell monitor. With the Spyder 3 Pro, I couldn't get an exact match between my computer and the external monitor. With the 4 Elite that's no longer a problem. The two monitors both are very close. The ability to connect the device to my computer to adjust the monitors to changing ambient light helps a lot too. Be advised that very bright light can still be a problem, and the adjustability of your individual monitor may limit how much the Spyder can adjust for ambient.The software that comes with the calibration tool is pretty easy to use. It has both easy guided modes and control every little aspect modes. For most uses the guided mode works fine for me. The Spydder device also does a pretty good job of calibrating my LCD projector. I own the main projector used for my photo club and for the first time, we are getting pretty accurate color for our presentations. Most projectors don't have the same degree of control as a good computer monitor so the calibration may not be as precise. That's a function of the monitor, however, not the Spyder 4 Elite.

$REVIEW.: My 7th Lumix since 2008 when I got a TZ4 which still takes great pics but has no manual control. Camera expertise is above a basic point & shoot, but not ready for a DSLR with different lenses; F-stops confuse me among other things camera-related + I don't want to carry around a heavy DSLR. My other Pannies-most of the time I've left the dial on iA or a scene setting since I don't know enough to use it on full manual control other than using Aperture Priority.Opening a camera box has never taken my breath away until now! The white camera is STUNNING and this is my most "pro-like" camera yet.  The build-quality, other than the battery/SD door, is top rate, although tapping my finger against the body it almost feels like plastic. I *think* it's aluminum as cheaper Panasonics I own are aluminum - other web sites say it's metal so I'll take their word for it. The tripod mount is metal, too.NOTE: Regarding the flimsy battery/SD door--this is identical to the door on my DMC-TZ4 I've been using since 2008. The TZ4's door hasn't broken, maybe it's stronger than it appears but at the same time I'm careful with it.Why didn't I order this sooner?  THE LENS CAP! I've owned bridge cameras and I absolutely HATE dealing with a lens cap. I could NEVER get in the habit of removing them so I'd get an error message. (My thanks to the reviewer who enlightened me that an auto lens cap was made for the LX7, sold by RainbowImaging.) You can purchase it here but I got it $5 cheaper on eBay.  It comes in silver or black.RainbowImaging Self-Retaining Auto Open Close Lens Cap Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7 Leica D-Lux6 (Silver / White)Features of this camera I love/PROS:My #1 love is the low-light capability due to a larger sensor.  I rarely use the flash, even indoors.Pet owners: You will LOVE this...photos will show every strand of fur on your cat or dog, no glassy-eyes, no red-eye (see the photo of my cat I uploaded here).Manual control aperture ring.Made in Japan!Fast shutter response, fast recycle time to next photo.Superb video quality.Size. Not too big, like a bridge or DSLR; although I do wish it was slightly smaller overall since I'm having trouble finding a case. Buttons have enough room between them so you don't accidentally push the wrong one.Fantastic photos - honestly, I have not deleted one yet due to it being poor quality!CON: Panasonic decided to reverse the Quick Menu and Display Buttons on this camera - WHY? I'm having a very hard time getting used to this change.I recommend a Class 10 SDHC card if you're using your camera for videos, the video playback quality is better and they cost only a couple dollars more than a Class 4 or Class 6 card.

One thing I liked most about this over others was that it rarely needed to be resynched.  The trackball worked pretty well for being so tiny, and the mouse buttons/scroll wheel were nice.But today, after using the keyboard for probably only 5-15 minutes per week over the last couple of months, it has gone haywire.  Pressing most keys on the keyboard now results in the keyboard sending multiple keystrokes to the computer.  For example, the "g" key sends "gv".

$review_text.: I am VERY disappointed in this TV. The 3D does not work. The system for delivering 3D to the viewer is flawed and needs to be re-designed so that it works.The glasses do NOT stay in sync with the TV so the 3D does not work.You must be RIGHT (3 feet max) in front of the TV for the glasses to synchronize with the TV.Other furniture in the room seems to interfere with the synchronization signal from the TV. You can't view from an angle or there is no signal and the glasses don't work.If you move your head - even just a little bit - the synchronization is broken between the TV and the 3D active Glasses. Then the glasses have to 'search' for signal which can take at least 5 seconds or MUCH longer. You may have to 'reboot the glasses'.The Glasses 'flutter' in and out and get 'stuck' when they loose signal. Then you have to 're-boot' the glasses.The VIERA Web interface is easy to use but has very few 'channels'.The picture quality is good, but my LG TV cost hundreds of dollars less and has better features and a more brilliant display.The picture is not very bright, and looks fake when the glasses do work.I rate this TV as a poor value for the money.

I think the sacrifice in this case is the bass.  It is a little light, and I only really notice it in the controlled environment inside my house.  Outside, with all the other noise competition, I hardly notice.  Other than the sound being a bit too crisp, it comes out nicely detailed, clear and accurate.  Another compromise--it does not affect my use of them, but it may yours:  There is no mic.I am particularly impressed with the blue tooth range:  I had them 75 feet away from my device (before I ran out of space) and they had not cut out even once.  Pair that great range with 12 longevity and I'll gladly give up a little bass!Most blue tooth stereo speakers &#34;cheat&#34; a little and have both speakers inside the same unit:  NOT these from Arctic!  When two speakers are encased in one unit, you can't space the two sound configurations apart from each other.  In these from Arctic, you get &#34;true&#34; stereo:  You hear certain sounds coming from one speaker, other sounds coming from the other speaker.  It makes a big difference to the listening experience to hear certain sounds coming from one direction, other sounds coming from a different direction--even when the distance between speakers is only two feet or so.  Then, when the speakers are angled out, the sounds get progressively further apart.And, they are definitely a good looking pair!  Even the case they come in will have you smiling as you zipper it open.  And I'm really happy they come in colors.NOTE:  There are several versions of this speaker on this product page at the time I am writing this review.  You should be aware of that fact and make sure you have the right button highlighted before you put it in your cart.  Also, be aware that a lot of the review are for wired speakers.*I received a sample product from Arctic.
$review_summary.: True stereo sound from separate speakers; great BT range; HUGE power storage

$review_text.: Not only does this have great 3D playback it also will let you playback 2D BluRay AND DVDs in a virtual 3D mode.  It took me a bit of fumbling around to find out how - it isn't in the manual how to do it.-When your 2D movie comes up press the &#34;Display&#34; button and go from there.  After that it is pretty self explanatory.  There are 3 levels of &#34;virtual 3D&#34; but they looked pretty much the same to my eyes.- All of this does require the use of a 3D TV of course - it had to be said for some.This player has the most online 'channels' I have seen on a BluRay player too.  I am so glad that I had issues with the first 3D player I bought (samsung) and then decided to get this one instead.Highly recommend this player especially if 2D to 3D upconversion is a priority and also because of the many online streaming options included in the player.
$review_summary.: LOVE IT!

$review_text.: I've ordered several Wasabi battery bundles in the past year, and have always been completely satisfied with the quality of the product, and considering the value offered - I don't think I'll ever bother with an OEM battery.  The included car and european plug adapters are nice extras, even if I never use them - nice to know I have them.
$review_summary.: My favored brand for additional batteries

$review_text.: I bought this sound card to use with a Steel Series Siberia headset. After about an hour of use, the sound card became extremely hot to the touch and burned out. Maybe it was a faulty product to begin with, but I have to say that this was a fail Steel Series. Oh well. I still love the company. Maybe you will have better luck.
$SUMMARY.: Failure

$review_text.: I previously owned a Terk HDTVa amplified antenna that served me pretty good for what I'm looking for (channels like ABC, CBS, NBC). However, in bad weather I would get a lot of artifacts due to poor reception. Plus, due to the way it's designed, it's hard to move the antenna out of the TV stand/desk to mount it elsewhere for stronger receiving signal. So I did more research and ended up with this Mohu Leaf Ultimate. The cost of it is just the same as a month of Cable TV bill, and it's very well worthed the dollar spent!  I get most channels on 5 bar signal strength now (versus 4 from the Terk antenna), and finally spot the Fox channel. I was always wondering what channel is Fox in our area, because the Terk never picked it up. Now, not only that I have Fox channel, it even has 4 bars!!!  I have to also note that you have to spend the time figuring out where's the best location to mount this antenna.  On the first couple tries I got very weak Fox channel and ABC/CBS/NBC are only 4 bars like before. I am really surprised of how shifting it 3 feet to the left and 6 inches down really make a world difference. So, try it at different spot before mounting it permanently.  Goodluck.

$review_text.: The EBR-2310 had no problem in sharing either my DLS or cable Internet connection between three PCs. The router comes with the free version of Network Magic which makes Internet, file and printer sharing effortless. Network Magic also has the ability to track the bandwidth usage of all connected computers down to the application level. I upgraded to the Premium Version of Network Magic since the free version has limited functionality after 7 days.
$SUMMARY.: It Works

 Works well
 No problems

 We use this brand at work also
 I have had to throw away cheapies that died early
 No more cheap UPSes for me.



$SUMMARY.: Awesome product.  A little pricey, but very reliable so far.  Excellent brand.
