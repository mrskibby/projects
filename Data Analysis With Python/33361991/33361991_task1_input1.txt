$REVIEW.: I have an 18 inch arm and the strap makes it around my arm (barely) but is still comfortable, strecthes and the ipod fits in nicely. I do have a problem locking the device at the top so I dont accidently turn up the volume or switch songs but is not a big problem. I gave the item 4 stars because like i said it does fit my arm at the momment and is still a little room for strecthing but im sure that if I do get much bigger that it will not be comfortable and will have to get another one. I have had the item for about a month and the velcro is still working nicely and havent had a problem yet.

$review_text.: Some people may look at the specs and write this off as a junk camera but they'd be wrong.I will admit most of Nikon's Coolpix cameras are pretty crappy. Great for the casual shooter that doesn't know any better but the P-series has always been different. This is truly an advanced compact camera and one that I find really compliments my Nikon DSLR very well. I previously owned the P7000 and while that was a great camera, I had some complaints. Well Nikon apparently was listening and made the P7700 the perfect P7000 replacement!I realize there was a P7100 but it wasn't too different than the P7000 for me to really call it an upgrade.If you're coming from a P7000 then you'll be interested to know the big improvements they've made!1. SPEED. Everything is faster. From shooting to just browsing in the menu. There is no significant delay and depending on your SD card it's even faster at writing to the memory card.2. They finally added commander mode which means just like certain Nikon DSLRs you can use the pop-up flash to trigger your Nikon flashes via CLS.3. Speaking of the pop-up flash it won't pop-up on it's own anymore. Meaning instead of a silly button that would always get accidentally pressed when you put it in a bag or pocket, the P7700 now has a sliding switch.4. They changed the lens diameter to 40.5mm and to a cap system. Anyone that has owned a P7000 knows how annoying and easy it is for those silly lens doors to get bent in. I had that happen and the repair bill was a lovely $65 from APS (Authorized Photo Services). Thankfully the P7700 has a simple lens cap. It may be kind of annoying because it's easy to lose the cap but you can easily buy a small little cap leash or since the lens diameter is now 40.5mm you can buy a protective lens filter if you want.5. Removed the optical viewfinder. Now some people probably don't like this but I do. On a DSLR I absolutely need a optical viewfinder but on my P7000 I hardly if ever used it. It was tiny, distorted and was awkward holding it to my face. With the P7700's articulating screen it doesn't matter. It allows me to shoot any way I want and is just so much easier. For those complaining that they won't be able to see the LCD in sunlight, it's articulating... freaking move it to an angle you can.6. More manual controls. One thing I hated about the P7000 was the inability to change ISO or the metering mode from a dial like I can on my D3. Thankfully with the function keys on the P7700 you can now do that! This by far is the biggest improvement to me. Makes shooting so much easier and easier to go back and forth between this and my DSLR.7. It's built way more studier. Not that the P7000 was plastic fantastic but the P7700 feels like a brick of metal yet not as heavy as you might think. Just feels SOLID.8. No accidentally turning it on. One thing about the P7000 is you could accidentally turn it on in your pocket and possibly damage the lens. However the P7700 disables the power on button when the LCD screen is folded in.There are probably more improvements I can't remember but those are the ones that stood out to me.I do have one complaint. The articulating LCD screen. It looks great, the problem is with the articulation. This isn't a real huge problem and after you get use to it it becomes a non issue but when you flip out the LCD screen it can only rotate a certain way. It seems logical for the most part but if you rotate it the wrong way too aggressively I bet you could snap the screen right off. But like I said through continued use you get used to it. My only other complaint is the LCD screen is not glass, it's a screen similar to camcorders.So if you're thinking of upgrading from a P7000 don't hesitate, if you want a compact camera to compliment your DSLR then this is the one for you!
$SUMMARY.: The true P7000 replacement!

$REVIEW.: I been having problems with my PC just cutting out, after researching the issue came to the conculcison that the issue was the power supply. I have had the PC a Dell 450 Studio 4 years now but just did not want to buy a new computer. I went out to Best Buys got a power supply once installed nothing happen, no power, took that back and got a different brand and the wirings for the harddrives would not reach so had to turn a harddrive upside down in the tower to get the thing to fit, that power suppy was $64 bucks..got to looking on amazon and found this one so took the Best Buys back and got that $64 back.This power supply was easy to install, had all the connections I needed, and they all reached! Now how long this $34.24 power supply will last is no telling, hey no tax! no shipping charges, you got to like these deals...

I have been very impressed so far. Video quality is solid in most situations. I really like that you can just drag and drop files of the camera to your computer, even in linux. Since it encodes the video using H.264 it is pretty easy to edit or transcode the video. Expandable memory is awesome, same goes for the ability to change batteries for a fresh pair. I wish it was a little smaller and lighter, but you can't have everything.

$REVIEW.: This is a pretty good case for the money. It is very low-key and doesn't stand out much, so if that's your taste then it is great. I suspect that is could keep my laptop safe from carrying height pretty easily, although I'm not about to test it. I would suggesting getting an iPearl case to go with this as well as an added layer of protection. The issues come in with the pockets. They are secured by elastic bands going across the top of the pockets themselves, and as others have mentioned, things inside of these tend to slip out. Also, thicker things like an external hard drive seem to push another the laptop when closing it up, which I don't like, although it probably isn't causing any damage. I would recommend keeping only papers and things like that in the inside pockets. The outside pocket is a bit better to store stuff in, and can accommodate my A/C adapter and extension cable rather easily. All in all, you get what you pay for. If you are looking to store other gadgets and accessories with your rMBP, i recommend you get something else. Otherwise, this is a decent case for the price.

$review_text.: This is a head-to-head comparison of the Canon SX30 IS and the Olympus SP-590UZ, which are both competitors in the super-zoom class of compact cameras. I will compare some of the features of these two cameras but mostly talk about the image quality between the two since I consider that the most important reason for choosing a camera.When the Olympus SP-590UZ came out in 2009 it had the longest zoom range of any compact camera with its 26x zoom equivalent to 26 - 676mm at f/3.5 - 5.0. Olympus has since come out with the SP-800UZ which has an even longer 30x zoom but is inferior in my opinion because it is strictly a point-and-shoot camera with no user control over aperture and shutter speed and no viewfinder.The Canon SX30 follows the SX20 and currently has the longest zoom range on the compact camera market, a 35x zoom equivalent to 24 - 840mm at f/2.7 - 5.8I took photos using both cameras of the same subjects using the same lighting and exposure settings. All photos were taken in aperture priority mode (Av). I have uploaded a number of comparison shots to the customer image section so you can follow along.At the far wide end of the range, both cameras performed about equally, that is to say, adequate but not extremely sharp. These cameras are aimed at birders and other telephoto enthusiasts, and so most of the test shots I took were at the long end of the range. Here the Canon was consistently sharper and was able to resolve finer detail, as in the photo of the evergreen tree tops, the milkweed seed strands, and the detail of the cement wall behind the light post. Both cameras quickly start to exhibit noise above ISO 100, but the Olympus was even showing some color noise at the lowest ISO setting of 64. By ISO 400 the shots are still usable but the noise in the Canon images is finer and better under control while Olympus photos are grainier. Noise reduction in Photoshop can clean up some of the noise with some possible compromise in sharpness.The one disappointment in the Canon SX30 is the macro mode. The focusing range is "approximately 0 - 50 cm" which sounds great but you literally have to get right on top of the object to fill the frame with the image. The Olympus has a dedicated Super Macro mode which allows you to take macro shots from further away from your subject. This not only allows you not to disturb your subject but also prevents the camera from casting a shadow on it. Macro shots with the Olympus are not only much easier to take but the results are better.Here's a direct comparison of some of the features of these two Super-Zoom cameras:Lens: Advantage Canon with a longer zoom and sharper focus. The Canon is faster at the wide end but both lenses are pretty slow in their telephoto ranges. Neither is great for capturing sports action or birds in flight. Neither camera is good for low light conditions without a flash either. Although the Canon lens is sharper it has some chromatic aberration.LCD screen: Canon has an articulating screen which means you can take shots from unusual angles and still see the screen. Olympus only has a fixed screen.Picture Modes: Canon has 10 color modes and one customizable mode, Olympus only has Normal and Vivid.Zoom markings: Canon lens has focal length markings on the lens, Olympus has none. Neither camera has a focal length readout on the screen, which would be nice.Lens Cap: The Canon lens cap can remain on while the camera is powered up. The Olympus lens cap has to be removed before powering on the camera, or else the protruding lens will push it off.Menus and buttons: I have no preference here, both cameras have good manual control and it's all about getting used to one or the other.Focus: The Olympus auto-focus seems to be more accurate at close distances. I saw some back focusing with the Canon at close range. Both cameras do a terrible job with manual focus, it is very hard to use. The Canon has a focus bracketing feature, something which I wanted to have for focus stacking, but I found out it only works in manual focus mode and it's slow. Advantage Olympus.Image Stabilization: The Canon seems to "lock in" while the Olympus seems to slowly drift. I prefer the "locking" image stabilization of the Canon even though it jumps around at times.Image Quality: This is where it counts and the Canon is the clear winner, particularly in the telephoto range. The images may need to be sharpened up in PhotoShop but the examples I posted were straight out of the camera. The Olympus would only be a better choice if you were going to be doing a lot of macro work.Conclusions:The Canon SX30 IS is the clear winner and appears to be the best super-zoom compact available at the moment. The optics may not be as good as a lens with a shorter focal range and there is some noise apparent even at low ISO values. Unfortunately camera makers insist on cramming more mega-pixels onto these tiny sensors which means more noise.  For these reasons and for the disappointing implementation of macro, Canon gets deducted one star.The image quality will never be as good as a DSLR or a Micro Four Thirds camera such as the Panasonic DMC-GH1 and I would not recommend this camera for professional or fine arts photography, but it would be a convenient and versatile choice under daylight conditions when you want to carry a minimum amount of equipment.

$review_text.: I purchased this mouse at the end of my heavy gaming &#34;phase&#34;.  I wanted a wireless desktop mouse but was afraid a non-gaming mouse would have poor polling rates and lag.  Well I certainly can't tell the difference between it being plugged in and unplugged (plugging it into usb both charges and acts as the data transfer connection) so that is a plus.  The plethora of buttons would have been awesome in the prime of my World of Warcraft days but now are far to many for standard browsing that I find myself most often doing.The biggest downside to this mouse is the batterylife.  Even using a profile that is battery saving, I have to plug the thing in every week or so if I leave the mouse turned on.  I have to remember to turn it off when not in use, but I often forget to do this.PROS:- Truly viable wireless gaming mouse- Multiple profiles for different games- Grip material on side is nice- Button clicks are crispCONS:- Poor battery life- Very heavy- Software looks archaicThis is not a casual use wireless mouse alternative.  This is a true wireless gaming mouse that has downsides overall (i.e. battery life) to approach wired gaming mouse standards.

$REVIEW.: I previously had the KOBO Wireless but replaced it with the Touch. I love both, though I did like my first one more. I am not a fan of touch screens, but almost everything is touchscreen so I cannot do anything but cope. The ereader does freeze once in awhile. I was told by KOBO that screen protectors are NOT recommended. Keep in mind that many sellers here on Amazon give "free" screen protectors with purchase of other items but that does not mean you should use them. I wish I had known this before I put one on my other KOBO. Also, when I put the ereader in a waterproof bag, like for the beach, the Touch gets a little crazy - flips pages randomly, hard to turn on, etc. - so I not longer use that. I love being able to take so many books with me when going places. The ability to add more books with the SD slot is also great. There is not a better ereader on the market. I did a lot of research before buying my first ereader & KOBO consistently came up as the best . Not a fan of the Kindle or Nook, but I assume that people look for different things and what works for me may not be best for other people. I have heard complaints about customer service, but I have found KOBO employees to be excellent! maybe it depends on the person's attitude. Remember, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar!

$review_text.: We have several Kindle devices and several cases.  TheBelkin Genuine Leather Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7", Gravel (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7")is one of the nicest for several reasons.  It is a true leather, has a soft black lining, allows for four viewing heights, is well made, and didn't come with extraneous packaging or literature.  The Kindle slips into elasticized corners of a plastic material and the elastic used to hold the closed case together is very soft.  I especially like the way the case actually slips into the slots when it is used as a stand.  My only criticism is that I tend to worry that the Kindle device will actually slip out of the corners if it is suddenly moved, but that has not happened.  The Gravel color is a very soothing medium gray.

$review_text.: The Tivo HD is a good DVR but it's not great.The reason I bought the Tivo HD was because Amazon had a deal on the tv I wanted and it came free with my new flat screen
 I've had it for about a year and have been pleased with it so far but it has its flaws.There have been times where the screen froze and needed to be restarted

 This takes about 5-10 minutes for it to be rebooted
 Netflix streaming is nice but their catalog is very small, especially with New Releases.The biggest flaw is that you cannot get your cable service's "on-demand" programming


 I've used the Amazon on-demand but you have to pay for the movies you watch and you have to wait while you download the movie.The UI is also very sluggish and out of date


 There needs to be picture in picture view while browsing other channels and it would be nice to be able to do pip for the other tuner as well.If you ever have a problem with your cable card, just forget about your cable company solving your problem too
 They have no clue about these things.When used as a DVR itself, it's great

 Searching for programs is easy and setting up recordings is the easiest thing to use in the world


 Anyone can use it
 The video quality is also limited to 1080i but nothing is broadcast in 1080p anyways.Overall it's not bad but if you can pay less that 12.99 for an hd-dvr from your cable company you might as well go for it.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for some new headphones after recently retiring my old Beats Solo's I purchased in 2011. They sounded good, to me, but lots of people who know audio said they were mediocre at best. They were starting to show their age, so I decided to get rid of them and find some replacements. Price wasn't really an issue, my budget was $0-150.After reading reviews for several different headphone models, including the new Beats and studio headphones from Audio-Technica and Sennheiser I found these Panasonic RP-HTX7 headphones that looked great, had great reviews, and were a fraction of the price.I read the reviews for these headphones and most people seemed extremely happy with them for the price. I have a pair of Sony MDR-V150's I keep at my office, so I'm no stranger to cheap headphones.So, the good, bad and ugly...THE GOOD:- Cool design. I really like the retro look- Great price- They fit okay, I guess. Little tight on my head, but they're light so I guess it's a tradeoffTHE BAD:- Cord is too short. Should be at least 12" longer, maybe 18". I'm sitting right next to my computer and I have BARELY enough room. I couldn't even turn my chair 180THE UGLY:- Honestly, my Sony MDR-V150's sound better and have more bass. The highs are a little muffled, and the lows - the bass - are nonexistent. I'm no audiophile, but these just don't sound good to me. My Beats Solo's had much deeper bass and crisper highs. Yes, they're more expensive, but these were touted as GREAT headphones for the money, and they don't even compete with the old Sony MDR-V150's I spent $25 on almost 10 years ago. And those are on-the-ear not over-the-ear.VERDICT:If you want headphones that look better than they sound, these are for you. If you want good sound at THIS price-point, get a pair of Sony's with the same drivers as the MDR-V150's. They use them in a ton of models, it looks like the MDRZX100 uses it and is only $15.I think I'm sending these back and using my MDR-V150's until I find something else to try.

$REVIEW.: I love this external battery. This is a device designed with the consumer in mind. This is a fully self contained unit that gives you so much convenience as a user. You never have to find the cable to charge the battery itself as it is built and stored on the unit. It also has a built in output that works for several phones as well as New Trent Airbender clam shell case. I love that I can charge my phone, my iPad and my friend's phone all at once. I hate having to be selfish with my power and now I don't have to. Being able to take all of you devices places knowing that you have some extra power is amazing. The large display shows you exactly how much power you have left to share and leaves no confusion.Pros:Can charge 3 devices at once. Looks great and is a self contained device that charges fairly quickly. Small, light weight and stylish.Cons: None really.  I loved this device wholeheartedly.
$SUMMARY.: Amazing

$review_text.: This was used on a Gateway tablet running Windows XP, to get newer technology than the onboard wireless offered. This works like a charm, with no problems.The adapter has an extension cable that makes it easy to use on a desktop computer so I can put the unit in the best position for wireless signal.  Also, you only have to reach behind the computer once to install the extension cable for the adapter, and can keep it in a handy spot if you'd like to unplug it and take it along for a laptop, etc.  I was unable to install it on my desktop PC, as there is no Windows 8 support included on the CD, and none of the website at this time.  I would expect that to change, as the driver selection on the website was reasonably comprehensive, but check before purchasing if this is a critical item for you.To manage the wireless connections, I tried both Windows built-in support for wireless devices, and the included utility.  I still prefer Windows' built-in support, but the included utility worked fine and was easy enough to use for most people.You will get the best experience if you also have a router that supports dual-band wireless, though it will work fine with older units that have only single band (the vast majority of routers/WAPs in use today fall into this category).This would get 5 stars if it supported Windows 8.

$REVIEW.: My goal was to buy a dirt-cheap Blu-Ray player of decent quality. I wanted access to Amazon videos (because I'm a Prime customer) and to be able to play video files off a USB stick. I got lucky and found a "used" BDP-S470 in "good" condition for $26 at Amazon Warehouse. They shipped me a BDP-S480 instead. Fine by me as the two models are very similar anyway. I have no idea why they considered it to be "used" because it looks and performs like brand new. With the two month free trial from Sony/Hulu I figure I paid $10.02 for this unit. It plays Blu-Ray discs beautifully. No problem there. Although it is Wi-Fi ready, it does not come with the Wi-Fi LAN Adapter, so no wireless connection for me. No big deal because I knew that when I ordered (I read the product description & reviews). So I ordered a $5 Ethernet cable and just plug it in when I want to access Netflix, Hulu, Pandora and Amazon videos (there are many more options too) . I retired my Roku and DVD player. One awesome feature for me is the ability to play videos off a USB stick or my Seagate external hard drive. I have been able to play divx/avi, mkv and mpg files, BUT not all of the files play. Out of the twenty I tested, sixteen played perfectly and I received a "corrupt" file message with the other four. It happened with all three file types. I would imagine there is a common denominator that makes these particular files unplayable. For now, I am very happy to be able to play the vast majority of them and in a variety of file formats. I cannot give any feedback regarding the 3D features, as I do not own a 3D TV. Just a couple of 42" Plasmas. Everything this player puts out looks beautiful and it does a lot more than just play Blu-Ray discs. Even at the current Amazon price of $89 it would still be a great unit for the price.
$SUMMARY.: One of the best deals I ever got!

$REVIEW.: Logo shows HIGH SPEED.  It is NOT high speed.I added this to a Dell D9150, which had a non-oem 5 port back hub that allowed for internal hookup of the USB cable.  The non-oem hub is a high-speed 2.0 card, and has always worked well.I wanted access to USB ports (more than the 2 on the front panel) for connecting digital cameras, HD handycams, iPhone and high-speed USB disks (16GB Kingston HDSD).I added the drive to an empty bay under the 13-in-1 Micro Card reader.  Simple install, using a floppy power cable.This device has yet to run at High-Speed 2.0.  Every device I have connected to it enacts a windows message "This device can run at a higher speed if you connect it to a High-Speed 2.0 port..."Whether it's pluged into the main OEM ports on the front bezel, the back of the 2.0 card or it's internal port, the same message appears.Upon opening the device, the infrastructure and chipset are noted as 2.0 only, no high speed certification logo on board.1 star...you get what you pay for.  I don't recommend this panel for anyone needing high speed support of devices.[Updated info]The card operates, as a pass fail system. and my review states I opened the device and investigated the circuitry...After researching the chipset, the onboard chip set shows it's architecture is not hi-speed upsteam.  If others are having success with this product as a high speed port device in both downstream and upstream modes, then they have a different chipset, and as a purchaser I was not given the opportunity to select the chip set that was shipped to me.Due to the cost of the item and it's private seller status, it's not economical to return the device.Also, nowhere in the product description is the product mentioned to be "Bi-Directional High-Speed", only in the picture is there a 2.0 compliant high speed logo.Upon investigation of the manufacturers main website, the device is listed as high-speed device that support "downstream" on all four ports. It is not a high-speed upsteam device.  The unit I have was tested to be infact downstream high speed, but is not high speed upstream, which for the use of read/write external drives (other than small flash drives), devices that require two way high speed communication, or an iPhone, this device is not acceptable.To clarify as some have commented, this is not a software issue.  Windows XP SP3 supports all revisions of the USB platform, when updated properly and regularly via Windows Update.  There is no software supplied with this device in order to ensure it's high-speed operation, nor is any update required.  If the user who commented had read my review, that would have seen that I already have high-speed devices working on the machine in question...without the proper USB driver's, these would also function at the slower level.From Wikipedia:"It is an important consideration that in common language (and often product marketing) USB 2.0 is used as synonymous with high-speed. However, because the USB 2.0 specification, which introduced high-speed, incorporates and supersedes the USB 1.1 specification, any compliant full-speed or low-speed device is still a USB 2.0 device. Thus, not all USB 2.0 hubs operate at high-speed."Search "USB hub" on wikipedia for an explaination of how these devices work if you are curious.I would encourage anyone who needs full USB 2.0 High Speed compliance for UPSTREAM (iPhone, HD Camcorder, External Hard Drives) choose another option or use a bus card with USB 2.0 HS compatability.

$review_text.: Honestly, I bought this because it was the cheapest full size backlit keyboard I could find.  It is everything I expected.  Key strokes are quiet relative to my previous keyboard, Keyboard fits in a reasonable amount of space, cord is sufficient length.Lights: the blue is a nice middle of the road blue, not really royal but not light.  The red is bold, and is probably my favorite color on this keyboard.  The purple is kind of lame to me but then again I don't really like purple anyways.The backlight does shut of if you hold the color button for a few seconds, and in normal light the letters are still easy to see.  Would recommend to a friend looking for a backlit keyboard.Cons: the light button is not lit, so you need to turn the light on before the room is dark, and it is not as easy to locate it in the dark to change the color.  Not a big deal to me personally.The letters are large print, so keys are labeled with abbreviations ex. PD on the page down key.

$review_text.: The good: They are comfortable and produce okay soundThe bad: they produce "okay" sound and are too comfortable, they do not hug my ears tight enough and are a bit too sloppy.Review:The sound is okay, not as good as my Koss Portapro but then those are 5x the price.there is a problem with the balance and these tend to put out 20%-50% more sound into the left channel. I suspect the volume control wheel to be the fault, I can turn these down and gradually increase volume to find when the left channel gets it's boost. It's really irritating and makes the sound experience lop-sided, I have flipped them around to be sure that I'm not just going deaf in my right ear, and the problem persists only opposite so it is not just my ears.It's not bad for general listening or watching movies, but I'm surprised they could put "Professional" on a set of headphones with such a flaw. I would argue that these are not good for studio use, not just because of the balance flaw but also because they are very loose and do not hug my ears tightly enough. If you're really tight on cash and know a bit about re-wiring headphones you could cut the volume wheel out and wire it in straight, assuming it is indeed the wheel that is to blame for the imbalance. My sound card does not support the "Balance" feature or that would work just as well.In conclusion:Buy these if you just need a simple pair of phones with decent but not perfect sound. You do get what you pay for most of the time, these are really good for their price but they do have the balance flaw issue.Now, I can't stand when I read a review that says they didn't like the product, or that the product wasn't that great but they do not provide any suggestions for something better, so I would suggest a pair of Sony MDR-V6 for quality/value/cost. Sony MDR-V6 are going to be my next serious choice in headphones if not the Ultrasone hfi-780's. I would love to go for Denon, but can't see myself paying that sort of price for headphones.

$REVIEW.: it's a tight fit as mentioned by others and it's difficult to remove the ZuneHD from the case. the plastic protection adheres tightly to the screen. This is likely by design so the touch works through the cover, which indeed works. I am using a small flat plastic strip cut from a milk bottle that I slide between plastic cover and screen to easily remove the ZuneHD from the case (it is rough enough not to adhere to either cover or screen, a business card works very well as well). This can be "stored" on the back side when Zune is in the case. The armband sits securely on my arm. If placed on upper arm slightly towards the front (upside down) it's easy to still use the player, without being in the way when exercising. Another advantage of this is that it can't fall out of the case if the velcro clip fails.very good product. I gave it 4/5 only because the fact that it's somewhat difficult to remove is still a nuisance.

$review_text.: I had purchased this very same thing from another manufacturer (Netgear) and despite only being capable of 85mbps, it cost me more than this one from ZyXEL


More importantly, it didn't even work!! I thought I must have done something wrong because it should just work, right?! I scoured the internet and found that these powerline adapters should work across circuits while others say they do not

So what gives?! The netgear adapters, when plugged in at opposite ends of the house and on separate circuits, did not work at all
These adapters from ZyXEL worked perfectly in the exact same configuration
I plugged one into the back of my router and plugged it into the wall


I plugged the other one into the back of my computer and plugged it into the wall

And it worked!! There was very minimal loss to speed as well with less than 1mb slowdown


Now to be fair, I don't know of any internet service out there that would provide speeds up to 200mbps, so there is no way to test if it truly is capable of this, but I'm completely content with the fact that it just works and now rooms that are too far away from the wireless signal can have a good, constant connection with no drops or loss in speed

I really had my doubts after the netgear failure and considering my home is pushing 70 years old, but I couldn't have hoped for a better result
Brilliant!

$review_text.: I hate screen touchers-you know who you are! And having a 27 inch iMac and a photography company, I knew anybody who looks at my screen would want to touch it. I used Spyder Elite calibration to make sure my colors were true, and I was a little concerned about using this. No concern necessary. Looks the same, only with anti-glare and anti-fingerprint now. Word of advice: Do NOT use windex to clean your monitor first. Purchase professional camera lens cleaners-they only cost $5-10-and take two minutes to clean it thoroughly first. Then, (with your computer/monitor completely turned off) spray the cleaner all over the screen. With 27 inches, it took me about 15-20 sprays. I then peeled off the wrapper, and placed the screen protector on. Spray the lens cleaner all over the front of the anti-glare screen, and then use a credit card to wipe out all of the lens cleaner between the anti-glare and the actual monitor. If you see something like looks like a crease, it's not. It's a hair. But the beauty of the using the spray is that you can peel the screen back, pull the hair out, respray, and then re-wipe the spray out. Mine is now mint, without a single speck of dust anywhere, and placed perfectly on the monitor. People can touch it, and you can't see a single smudge. Not one bit. I highly recommend this, and packaging was impressive as well. I love it.

$REVIEW.: It's small, it's inexpensive (the price keeps dropping), it works, and I installed it in 10 minutes.  It's in my wife's company car, and she loves it.The sound quality is really quite good for running the output through the FM receiver.  And I love being able to listen to XM selections on my computer by virtue of an XM subscription.If you want, you can also buy a home adapter so that you can play it through your stereo or home theater.  But I've heard tell that you have to get the antenna really close to a window to ensure decent reception.  It works fine in a car, though.Me likee.

$REVIEW.: This card is superb. $500 and a little know-how gets you a card that performs like its $1,000 counterpart. It will handle any game at 1080p on the highest settings with ease. It is also one of the best cards out there now for resolutions higher than 1080p as well. Simply put, this card is overkill for 95% the games you throw at it and you will be set running games at the highest settings for a long time to come.
$SUMMARY.: Great card

$REVIEW.: Bought these pads to replace the crumbling pleather pads on my Sony MDR-V6 headphones. I followed some instructions found on one of the reviews here on Amazon and within two minutes of opening the package had the new pads on. The Beyerdynamic pads are more comfortable, better fitting, less sweaty, and at a glance more durable than the Sony pads. I honestly can't tell the difference in terms of sound quality and that is a good thing. I really like the way my V6s sound and wouldn't want to change it.

$review_text.: in additionI will say one thing - the blue lights could be a little less bright. I decided on this solution because my Dell 8500 has only two USB 3.0 ports on the front (2 more in the back) and most of the USB ports are 2. Why any 2s at all and why not put them all on the front? This box provided the solution. The ports sit in front -are easy to reach and it has a good, well built feel to it.Your device helps me with a serious design failure of the 8500 at a decent price and 6 more ports to boot - so now I have 9 3.0 ports

$REVIEW.: In my business, I need lots of portable storage

So I am always scanning for sales on large capacity 2.5" external drives

Most of the time, I wind up buying 500GB external drives because they seem to go on sale more often

This time, however, I was able to buy the Hitachi X750 Mobile 750 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive at an extremely attractive price


But like so many extremely attractive offers, the bargain may be too good to be true.Good move
Hitachi drives are historically excellent and I don't expect these to be anything less.The design doesn't exactly thrill me and the idea that the "ergonomic" styling adds any utility to the drive is, in my opinion, a bit far-fetched


But they are nice looking and something of a departure from the normal boxy external hard drive


The warranty on these units is short, only a year


I strongly suggest at least looking into extended warranties
It is my opinion that this kind of hard drive should carry a three-year warranty, but that is only my opinion.I lowered my rating from five stars to three because of the warranty issue


I opened up the box of one these drives yesterday, plugged it in and heard some really major rattles


No way was I going to use that drive, which I had purchased in January, 2011


I checked Hitachi's website to learn the return procedure and was shocked to learn that the warranty starts when the drive leaves the factory! Thus, my "one year warranty" expires in November - ten months after my purchase
I consider this to be a very consumer unfriendly policy and will hesitate to purchase Hitachi drives in the future.The drives are literally silent
A pair of LEDs on the underside keep you informed as to drive activity
Read/Write speeds are par for the course.Oddly, the drives come formatted with FAT32 which is increasingly archaic


I immediately reformatted them as NTFS.Hitachi includes backup software on the hard drive out of the box, but I didn't even bother with it.Overall, shop carefully, find these on sale and enjoy the wonders of massive desk space
They're also fine values at their everyday price as well.04/20/2011I've lowered my ranking of this drive to 1-star

The second of four the drives I purchased failed with the same symptom I described above, a very pronounced clicking

Could be a head crash


Point is that the odds of two drives of a batch of four failing with the same symptom are astronomically high

I understand Hitachi is in the process of selling its hard drive unit

Doesn't matter: I will avoid this once fine brand in the future.Jerry

$SUMMARY.: Cannot recommend these drives

$REVIEW.: I just ordered this refurbished unit for well under a hundred dollars with a hdmi cable included, and I will provide a thorough updated review when it arrives and I use it.  Of course, panasonic durability is well known, I have a five piece carousel Panasonic DVD/CD Player DVD-CV47 that I've owned for so long I've forgotten when I purchased it, am thinking I've had it for about ten years.  Of course that was pretty new technology/merchandise back then and it even has an s video link port, but is now used as a cd player mostly since I have other dvd players around the home, I used it alot previously, though it has some compatibility issues with cd-r backups of music(firmware upgradeable?, ah, don't matter I guess).All I care basically is some blue ray playing and I don't have high speed internet or such, actually streaming video online doesn't really interest me(being old school video purchasing/renting), just playing some blue ray movies and up-converting regular dvd's to my 720P lcd t.v is bout all that interests me.  I'm hoping there won't be any over complicated firmware updates that are too hard to perform.  I am actually hoping the upconverting of regular dvd's is going to be okay, I worked hard not to buy a upconverter when a blue ray player would accomplish the same thing for just a little more money.  I still don't believe the technology has caught up with blue ray players for them to be even reliable for streaming video, or all the extras they are trying to bundle in them, it probably makes them unreliable even more, which is why I almost bought the panasonic bd45 for $99, a totally no frills model.  Well anyway, this was cheaper by far since I needed an hdmi cord included too, and was last years equivalent model to the bd 65 of this year.  I'll put mine through its paces and will make sure refubished unit means something good or it can go back.***UPDATE##$$ I received the unit rather fast, and it operates pretty fast so I can't see where folks say theirs are "very" slow, this takes about five seconds to start up once I hit power on, but starting up even blue rays is relatively quick compared to the scares of some products and others' reviews even of same product, dunno, I mean, I don't think I am hyping the speed other than it appears to have been reworked recently, it works great, I don't have high speed internet anymore to check the internet goodies of which I don't care about, can't tell if it has ever been owned before since it is like new and only the warranty pages for panasonic have yellow "x's" marked on them, ....it upconverts regular dvds, like old b-movies with poor transfers really well, it has three audio remaster settings or the factory setting(its just something to play around with on bad audio, not sure if it really helps or not sometimes), and playing of blue ray movies is going okay for right now, though I have tried only two movies so far.  The remote control has sections to control my t.v and just audio for my old, very old, like 1991 pioneer multi receiver.  When I pop in a movie, it automatically tunes in my t.v to the hdmi port I use for blue ray, other than digital satellite hdmi port.  The hdmi cable included with it seems to do its job rather well.  I guess time will only tell, I'll be renting blue ray movies at least a couple times a month to test the blue ray function, will buy more used/new blue ray movies, time will tell.But once again, upconversion of my old b-movies of public domain movies put on 50 packs(like mill creek 50 horror classics) I bought here on amazon is terrific, much better than my regular dvd players, they play just as best as some of those poor transfers can play.On an odd note, there was literature with the instructions pertaining to online content media capabilities, netflix was listed with a little check next to it, don't know what that means, I don't have high speed internet.  Was mine upgraded to 2010 standards?  AS fast as it is, sure seems so, it is faster than my friends panasonic bd30 from last year on loading bd and regular dvd's!

$REVIEW.: The 2X2 GB Memory kit does its job completely and perfectly. Here's how I became acquainted with it:I've been noticing a significant lag time with my MacBook, especially when opening multiple applications. Up until acquiring this 4 GB kit, I was using only 2 GB memory. After ordering this product and installing it, I noticed considerable improvement in my computer's usual speed- and I even noticed a slight decrease in boot time, so overall, everything became quicker.The 2x2GB chips come in a durable plastic container. The instructions are very simple: turn off the Mac, let it cool down, take out the battery, and unscrew the bar that holds the memory chips in place. Pretty straightforward. Things get tricky, though, when you remove your old memory chips and you want to install the new ones. So, pay attention, because apparently this is very, very common, according to Apple Genius Bar: you'll remove the previous memory chips easily, and then put the new ones in, and then you will feel as if you've put them in all the way, but they won't click. So you'll press a little harder.. and nothing will click. Chances are, you'll get scared and not know what to do, because you don't want to break/damage anything.You have to press hard. You have to keep pressing the chips until you hear the click. It'll be nerve wracking, but as long as you have the chips positioned the proper way to go in (there are diagrams online AND inside your Mac, for your convenience) your chips will be fine. This is the only problem I had with the experience, and I'm glad to say it was a pretty low-key problem that was taken care of pretty easily. Anyway, as long as you've read this review, you should not have any problems.Otherwise, the product has no issues- great quality, improves speed, not terribly expensive (I was going to buy a solid state HD to improve my computer's speed- that would have set me back $400-500.) If you use a Mac, and you're only on 2 GB memory, I HIGHLY recommend upgrading your memory with this package.Hope this helps- please comment/ask questions if you have any more concerns.

Weight is just about perfect as is the size.  Does not come with software but had basic functionality right out of the box on WinXP. Setpoint software makes the mouse very tweakable and can be downloaded free from [...].  Deducted one star because the wheel button is slightly stiff requiring a little extra to force to click.  Overall this mouse kicks the crap out of any other mouse used previously.  Would definitely buy again.

$review_text.: I loved these ear buds out of the box. I thought I was getting a steal of a deal for the quality of sound I was getting for the price of these. Only problem was that within the first 3 months the left ear bud started cutting out. Then it would start working but volume was drastically low. I wish these worked because I would have stayed with these but reliability appears to be an issue for this model. I recommend either the Klipsch S4 Image II or RHA 750i. So far I've been happy with these models. Also had a pair of beats tours but could never find a good fit even with all the included ear tips. Also like the bose offerings. Great fit and balanced sound. But overall the RHA 750i are my go to IEM.

$REVIEW.: The brush is well made & soft (very important). No loose bristles as reported by some others. I haven't tried the smudge remover yet.For my money, the best brush for optical work is a genuine camel hair brush - if you can find one. I also like a very nice brush I got from Edmund Optical some years ago; it looks just like a lipstick container, and the brush is advanced & withdrawn just like lipstick. It is an order of magnitude better than the Nikon brush - it would get 5 stars easily. Still, this one is good enough to carry in my camera bag.

I'm a bit worried the adhesive on the case frame that holds the tablet to the back of the cover may not hold up over time, but we'll see. It would have been nice for the front cover face to have had notches or indentations in it to help keep the tablet from sliding when putting it in a &#34;stand&#34; orientation. I have to use the magnetic close strap to keep it in place by wedging it in front of the tablet.

$REVIEW.: Pros: Nice open interior design, great cable routing options, solid construction.  Really easy to build, with space behind the mobo for cable routing.  Reasonable default set of 3 x 2.5&#34; (modular) + 2 x 3.5&#34; (removable) + 2 x 5.25&#34; bays, all toolless.  Excellent affordances for graphics cards and larger power supplies, water cooling (may cost a 5.25&#34; bay).  Front and bottom dust filters.  Nice clean exterior lines.  You can get a windowed side-panel version if that's your thing.It is bigger and bulkier than it looks, and not so easy to get hold of.  The push-to-release frontpiece tends to come off when I move the case -- but it's not meant to be all that portable, and would be a serious lug to a LAN-party or some such.  For me, none of those are issues.Cons:  Comes with only 2 fans (140mm front and 120mm back) and open grille top.  That may be sufficient for a basic build but does not provide enough directed airflow.  Need to add another front fan and two top fans/water cooler for a build with hot CPU and graphics card(s) -- easy to do, but add that to the cost of the case.  Five good, slow fans will move move air and be quieter than two faster fans (checked!).  Ding 1/2 star for the open top grill with no fans -- either a plate or fans would be an improvement.
$SUMMARY.: Great case design and features, easy to make a clean build, great air flow is possible (w/ more fans)

 There are other units on the market that cost quite a bit more but for the price I'd expect better

 The cutting pads for instance cut unevenly


 It needs to be water cooled and use better compound
 I'm going to try some compound from an Auto Paint store

$REVIEW.: Pros:1. If all goes according to plan, this product is easy to install, as it only involves the Plug USB Bluetooth receiver which also doubles as a flash drive and install program, and the digital pen.2. It doesn't clutter your hard drive with anything except drivers, and you don't have to enter your personal information and life history.3. The kit is immaculately packaged, and contains 1 Bluetooth pen (and AAA battery), Bluetooth USB receiver, 3 pen refills, 30 sheets of recycled paper 8.5 * 11, A4 notepad for digital flipcharts, binder to keep paper together, a carrying case for the pen & receiver, plus customizable color rings for pen & receiver.4. Here's where the fun starts - using the paper provided and the pen, you simply write, sketch or doodle on the paper, and your squiggles of wisdom are transferred via the Bluetooth pen to the receiver and are shown on your computer screen or big screen presentation.5. This product is really good for presentations. On the right hand side of the paper are some "I can't believe it's just paper" features like selecting thickness of the pen stroke (fine, medium, thick), selection of colors white, green, blue, red, yellow, black. You can select and draw arrows, lines, squares, circles, solid squares, and solid circles. You can also erase but this is only for onscreen and not on the paper itself, so your paper can get cluttered in a jiffy.6. There's a feature to go back and forth in the presentation and to add new slides to it and even delete slides.7. You can print out your slides (in advance) on the special paper for making accurate notations on slides during the presentation.8. You can save notes for future reference (or proof) and also e-mail the annotated pages to participants. (Note: I haven't actually tried this myself, but it sounds like a good feature)9. Comes with a nice little carrying case, and a handy (albeit mundane) ring binder for filing your documents.10. Portable.Cons:1. You have to make sure that you disable your onboard Bluetooth receiver or your annoyance level will rise exponentially every time it bounces you out of the installation process, especially as you have to remove the USB and then re-insert it each time.2. I had problems installing it on my HP laptop (running Vista), as it kept insisting that I had a Bluetooth device connected (not true).  I finally installed it on another laptop (Toshiba, running Vista) and after about 10 minutes of installation it finally worked.3. The digital pen is ungainly, but necessarily so, as the technology beneath its frumpy exterior is what makes the magic work.4. The USB Key has a nice look and feel, but needs to be supersized beyond its meager 256Mb capacity.5. You need to know your A4 from your A3 paper sizes (I used A4)6. The Bluetooth pen only works on the paper provided, so you'll need to get refills according to your usage.  Refills for the printable paper come in packs of 200 sheets, which are not that bad price-wise if you're doing presentations for a living.7. Print outs are in blue.  This is a bit of a problem when you've used different colors to make clear illustrations.8. If you're not using your own computer, you'll need to schedule some set up time in case you have problems.Overall, a solid product if you do a lot of Power Point presentations or training, especially if you get paid for doing them, and a really cool (albeit expensive) toy for those who just like to tinker with technology.Amanda Richards, November 19, 2009

$review_text.: I use this in the car with an iphone and bluetooth to fm transmitter, to add speakers to my car's outdated system. At first I thought the volume was too weak, but found out it was the volume control on the fm transmitter. This boombox gets louder than I need in fact (I am getting old -lol). The base button doesn't do much, just kind of makes the music muffled. It would have been nice if it came with a 12v car adapter, so you could skip the 8 D batteries. That's why I gave it less than 5 stars. I had a boombox back in the 80s that came with a cigarette lighter adapter for the car. I tried to find a compatible 12v adapter cable online, but could not.  Also the bass could be better, but not for this price. I would have been willing to pay a little more for a 12v adapter to be included. I hate dealing with "disposable" batteries.  I plug it into a small power inverter so I don't need batteries in the car, but then I get the sound of the fan from the inverter you can hear if the music is off and the boombox is plugged in.  Otherwise for the price it is a great value. I havent used the CD player.  I highly recommend this boombox.
$SUMMARY.: Great Stereo Sound

$REVIEW.: I chose an iRiver H10 over the iPod and was looking for external speakers to use at home in place of a radio and CD sound system.  (The H10 has an FM-tuner as well has handling mp3 and wma music/talk files.)  I chose the JBL OnTour Speakers based in part on a few reviews, on the price, and the JBL reputation.The sound is good, but not spectacular.  Most of my music is classical or Christian praise.  The sound may be a touch better than the JBL speakers in my Compac laptop.  If I had $300 to spend, I might see if Bose has an auxiliary input.  But, I don't. The JBL speakers will do just fine.The appearance is pleasing, especially when the case is closed.  A white cover slides back to reveal the silver speaker case.  It has a small footprint and is currently sitting on my laptop caddy, next to my pc.  If you are satisfied with good sound, and have $100 or so to spend, you will likely enjoy this product.
$SUMMARY.: Good sound, Attractive appearance

$REVIEW.: I've been using this external harddrive for almost 4 years now and it still works great!I remember when I received it, it was really easy to install and took only a few minutes.  It's small and doesn't take up very much space.  It's also sleek looking, so it's not an eye soar in your office space.  I got this for my macbook pro and it's works perfectly with Apple's preinstalled backup system, Time Machine.It does make a little bit of a buzzing noise when it is backing up the files, but I back up once a week, so it doesn't bother me at all.

$REVIEW.: You have to be careful about buying SD memory cards (microSD, MiniSD, etc...) because often times they are counterfeited with a false classification. The Class 10 cards seem to be the majority of fakes, where some Chinese obscure factories will produce the much cheaper Class 2 or 4 rated chips and counterfeit them as Class 10 major brands, complete with convincing packaging, branding and paint even. It really comes down to the luck of the draw though, because from the same supplier, you can get either the genuine chip or the counterfeit -or even both together. The supplier would have no way of knowing if a shipment of the counterfeits are mixed with the genuine chips. They do a god of painting these chips to make them look almost exactly like the genuine brands and they even get the packaging just right. To the trained eye, you might be able to sop tiny little differentiating clues.*Results here: As for this card here, I got a genuine Lexar Class 10 MicroSD and it works at slightly higher speeds than the classification advertises.  Upon writing a 2GiB file of uncompressed music and pictures, it writes at an extremely consistent 11.8 MB/s. (Class 10 stabdard is 10MB/s.) As far as reading, this card gives another extremely consistent result of 16.7 MB/s with the same 2GiB file full of music and pictures. I would definitely recommend purchasing these chips from this seller. But again, be careful where you get these SD chips. Both Lexar and Sandisk are great brands, but Samsung makes some great cards too.We always have many of these chips lying around because you use them for almost anything that is leaving the office due to their tiny and convenient size.
$review_summary.: Works as advertised and even faster than the class 10 rating it received.

$REVIEW.: Excellent sound quality -- full, rich (albeit not well-defined or "punchy") bass, which is almost impossible to find in small headphones and earbuds.  Mids and highs are just fine.Comfortable and secure -- they fit right in my ears right out of the box with no fussing, and they stay in place, even if the cable's tugged a bit.  Much better than the @#$%@#$^@#$^ Wicked buds that cost twice as much and took me dozens of attempts fussing with the three different rubber doohickeys to fit in my ear comfortably and not fall out when the wind blows.I was happy paying $20 for it at RadioShack.  I'm a little bummed to realize now that I could have gotten it more than 50% off if I'd bought it here on Amazon.Do not hesitate to buy these earbuds.

$REVIEW.: I know what you're thinking while looking at these reviews: "Should I save fifty bucks and get the 3rd Generation iPod touch, or is the 4th Gen really worth the new price?"I am happy to report that the improvements made from 3rd to 4th generation are worth your attention.* Size/Shape: The new model is thinner and more narrow, but slightly taller/longer. What this translates to in real-world usage is that the device is slightly less bulky in your pocket once you put a case on it, but that it's a tiny bit harder to grip without a case, if you have big hands. Of course, since Apple continues to put that scratch-magnet shiny back on the iPod touch (PLEASE, Apple, STOP IT! Give us brushed aluminum or something!) you will probably need a case, so the thinness is a good thing.* Microphone: No, you don't get the headphones with the in-line microphone anymore, but you do get a microphone built into the iPod touch. While most people focus on the Face Time, Skype, or other social uses for a microphone and lament the loss of one on the headphones, as someone who doesn't care about VOIP, I find the built-in microphone a lot better for my purposes. I use it for voice commands in the iPod ("Play artist 'The Beatles'") and for dictation (Dragon's free app is awesome) and voice memos. It also functions well for video recording. I don't miss the in-line earbud microphone at all.* Video Recording/Photos: While the iPod touch won't replace a top-line video camera, and most definitely won't replace a decent digital camera, it works as a "I happen to have it in my pocket" substitute on both counts. I don't take a lot of photos, so the lower resolution on the camera doesn't bother me. The video, however, is quite nice, and replaces my Flip Mino HD without a hitch. Just remember to reserve some storage space if you intend to record videos.* Retina Display: Wow. You have to see it to understand why it's a big deal. You don't notice it as much in the main screen, but when you get into text displays you really see the difference. Everything is crisp, there's almost no pixelization and nothing is "fuzzy". Games that support it look gorgeous. It really is worth it if you intend to use the iPod touch to do any reading, web browsing, or gaming.* iOS 4: I love the OS changes they made since I owned a 3rd generation iPod touch. The ability to group apps into folders/groups is about the best thing they did since the iPod touch debuted. The ability to do multitasking is very handy, too. The Gmail integration is much better now that it supports IMAP, and the contacts are much more friendly to Windows users since they started providing decent support for Google Contacts. WiFi signals seem to be stronger, and the battery life is excellent. All told, the little changes make a big difference.* Video Playback: Now that they've increased the screen resolution to 960x640, videos are not as limited. This means that if you have a collection of 720p m4v/mp4 videos already, they'll work with the iPod touch. You won't need to downscale them to make them work. This also means that if you choose to output to a HDTV screen, you'll get your full 720p video in all its glory. This is a great feature for media hounds like myself. If only Apple made a 1TB iPod touch..!* Improved buttons: While the buttons are no longer metal (they're now plastic or polycarbonate), they are much better-designed in terms of placement. The volume toggle has been turned into two separate buttons for up and down, and they work quite well when you're not looking at the device (like when it's in your pocket). The standby/power button is smaller and to the right of the top of the device, and it, too is easy to find and use when the device is out of view. Response from the buttons is nice, with a good clicky tactile feedback. They seem sturdy and yet they're small enough to be unobtrusive and not be pressed accidentally.* Speaker: They went from using the whole back panel as a speaker board to putting in a little speaker in the device at the bottom. This has the effect of making things sound a little better, but not without some problems (see below).- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -THE CONS* The new size means you will probably need a new case and screen protector. Old ones won't fit. Some exceptions exist (some slip-cases, for example) but anything that was an exact fit for the previous models is too big for the current model.* No in-line microphone on the earbuds. This is not a problem for me, but for social networking types, this will be something they miss.* Speed is, at this point, no better than the previous model in most cases, and sometimes slower in apps that have yet to update some features. This will no doubt change, but right now expect no major boost in speed or power with the upgrade to 4th Gen.* Still camera is low resolution. As I noted above, it's not a crippling issue for me, as I don't take lots of photos and the video camera is so nice, but if you're a shutterbug looking for an alternate digital camera, you may be a little let-down by the current generation. You're probably better off with an iPhone 4 or waiting for the 5th Gen iPod touch and crossing your fingers.* Dock connector doesn't sit flush with the device. It looks weird at first, but when you connect to the docking cable, the connector doesn't seem to go in all the way if you look at it from the back of the iPod touch. This is, apparently, by design. I can't say I like it, but this is the sacrifice you get with thinner devices. Apple didn't want to give up the tapered design, but they didn't want to redesign the dock connection, either. The compromise was to make the connector do what it currently does. This is not really a big deal, as it works fine and feels secure, but it does make you wonder how some third-party docks and devices will work with the current generation.* Speaker gets blocked easily. I know this is more of a critique of App design than iPod design, but the iPod touch's speaker being in the bottom corner causes me to end up covering the speaker when I turn the device sideways (to the left) to play a game. Smart Apps make it possible to tilt the screen any direction, but some are set on making you tilt to the left, which leads to the speaker blockage. Again, no big deal, but it makes me wonder why Apple doesn't just put the speaker on the side of the device instead of on the bottom. There's little chance you'd block it on a sideways/widescreen App in that case.* Stupid shiny back: I mentioned this earlier, but WHY, Apple? Why do you keep putting this horrible shiny back on the iPod touch? It was terrible back on the classics, and it's terrible now. Give us something that doesn't get scratched from the slightest touch, and something that isn't slippery! Brushed aluminum, rubberized metal, or anything else would be preferable to this stupid shiny back-plate. This, for me, is the iPod touch's #1 bad feature.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -SUMMARYIn my opinion the newer model is worth the new price. You get a lot of extra features and the best screen on any iPod to date, and the microphone being built-in becomes a must-have feature after you realize how convenient it is to not have to hook up the earbuds in order to record something. So here's the rundown on whether or not you should upgrade from 3rd Gen to 4th Gen:* If you're a reader: YES. The Retina Display makes reading books and comics much easier on the eyes (although I still prefer e-ink for long stretches or reading outdoors).* If you're a gamer: YES. The Retina Display, better speaker, and new gyroscope/accelerometer make gaming better.* If you're a social networking freak: YES. The video camera, still camera, built-in microphone, and Face Time are a social networking fan's wet dream.* If you're looking for a PDA: NO. It doesn't really matter unless you want to take advantage of the video camera for business meetings, or have bad eyes and want your address book to look more crisp. You could probably get by with the 3rd Gen, but honestly, you're probably already using iPhone 4 so this is a non-issue.* If you're looking for a portable web browser and mail client: YES. If you're on the Internet a lot, you'll appreciate the Retina Display and better WiFi reception from 802.11n.* If you just want to play music: NO. Don't bother to upgrade because the music/iPod functions aren't all that different from the previous generation, unless you want the convenience of the built-in microphone for voice commands.* If you just want to play videos: YES. The higher resolution and Retina Diplay make videos much better, and the ability to output 720p is a great feature for videophiles.Final verdict: For most users, the newer model is a much better value. Apple improved the iPod touch enough this time around to make it worth grabbing the 4th Gen, even if you do end up paying a little more for it than a clearance-model 3rd Gen.
$review_summary.: A definite improvement over the previous generation.

$REVIEW.: This is a quality bag that fits the camera well and looks nice, but if I were to do it over again, I would buy one of LowePro's video camera bags. This bag doesn't have any exterior accessory pockets and it drives me crazy. This bag does come with a weird pouch on the strap to hold the NEX pancake lens, but the NEX doesn't have a built-in flash.  Where am I supposed to keep that? What about a USB/HDMI cable, extra battery, my adapter ring for my Sony Alpha lens, cleaning cloth, etc.?  There's one (TINY) accessory pocket on the inside that holds a memory card.  Hooray.The bag is high quality like all Lowepro bags, so if you don't mind not having a place to put any accessories, the bag is great. But I wish I'd bought something else so all those other things weren't rattling around in my backpack.

$REVIEW.: The "Superlux" is one of hundreds of brands, under which these headphones are sold. And they symbolize new quality era in geniuine chinese made headphones. The key secret is used speakers - these are 100% same as being used in AKG and Sony headphones (since made at same chinese factory). So, from there comes the sound quality, which costs you less, compared to the original brands. Saying literaly, Peter paid $100 for sony's headphones, and price included development of these headphones. While Paul bought superlux, he paid nothing for development, since development was funded by sony.To be short, Superlux HD661 is clone of Sony MDR-7506.Regarding the sound quality, here's what you get:1. Clear and powerfull bass, but not the boombox like effect, like with Koss porta pro, you'll get just enough of bass. But you can pump it up with EQ - headphones can do much more.2. A bit overbrighten and sharp higher mids - may be irritating for a longtime listening experience. However, saxes, trumpets and other reed/brass instrument sound totally live and give you full presence feeling. You'll definetly need some EQ punch, to correct this error.3. Very clean and transparent high frequencies, with amazing detail clarity. This is the are where these headphones really shine.4. Despite having closed design, these headphones are no way meant to heavily reduce outside noise. Even my crappy sony mdr-nc7 beats them hands down, when coming to noise cancelling. So, listening experience better to be restricted to inside areas.5. Input impedance is quite high, so your average iLemming player may have no enough juice to rock these headphones really hard. This again suggests stationary usage of these headphones. If you still want to use them with iLame devices, you'll need an external amp.6. Sadly, these headphones aren't just like koss porta pro, which you can plug in, and forgot about EQ, since they sound just right out of the box. With these superflux ones, you'll need careful EQ tweaking, to suit your needs.7. The overal construction is bulky, but comfortable enough. The cables included are of very high quality, and their thickness suggests that they can be used for towing the boats :)8. Many websites have euphoric posts about these $50 headphones sounding as $100 or even $150 headphones. They all are wrong. These headphones indeed are VERY NICE headphones, but they sound exactly for the price they cost - $50.That's all. Feel free to ask more if interested.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a PCI-E graphics card that costs less than $100 and will last more than 9-10 months.The EVGA 9400GT 1GBDDR2 PCI-E 2.0(01G-P3-N945-LR) works well so far.-It's standard 6cm fan isn't very loud (my CPU fan is much louder).-Cooler components last longer, it's temperature averages 37 degrees Celcius (98.6 Fahrenheit) including some gaming and photo editing, and at boot-up, it's down at 34 degrees Celcius.-The performance is noticably better than the PNY GeForce 7600GS it replaced, and very similar to my overheating XFX 8600GT 512DDR3 (but I have not benchmarked or performance tested it yet).As other reviewers mentioned, the EVGA 9500GT probably offers a slight performance advantage for only 10-15 dollars more, and that's probably a better bargain for more serious gamers. I'm satisfied with the 9400GT for casual gaming, and I simply wanted a graphics card that will last more than a year. So far, so good.
$SUMMARY.: Cool and Quiet.

$REVIEW.: I got a CT12 (unless it was a CT10) back in 2000.  I loved it: it saved my neck from the pain associated with tilting my neck to hold a phone between my shoulder and my ear.  The sound quality was great.  The phone worked whether docked in its charger or while roaming the house.  The sound quality was exceptional.  the only problem I ever had with it was that I dropped it all the time and finally, after years of abuse, I killed it.  (In fact, I had two of these phones between 2000 and 2010, when I finally decided I couldn't squeeze anymore life out of the second one, also a victim of falls.)  Compared to the older models, this CT14 is a terrible disappointment.  I'm using it in the same location, yet now there is a constant irritating sound in the background.  And it cannot be used while docked in the charger.  May not sound like a big issue.  But to answer these phones, one has to get the headset on, then press the talk button before the call goes to voicemail.  With the old model, those were the only steps.  With the CT14, there is a 3rd step -- pull the phone out of the charger, get the headset on, then press talk.  It's not so easy to do that quickly, especially when the headset plug can pull out of the phone quite easily.  Also, if you're using the phone and inadvertently put it back in the charger because you're using it while sitting at the desk where the charger is, the phone disconnects the call.  If it does this because of some danger of the phone blowing up or giving me cancer while in use and in the charger, I'd be interested to know.  Otherwise, it just seems like a design flaw.  My rating of this phone is particularly low because I loved the older model so much.  It was a revalation.  This one is terrible by comparison.  (If you never had the older version, this one might not frustrate you as much as it does me.  But really, I am not okay with the terrible sound quality.)

$review_text.: This is a great camera on its own but it has some major limitations.1. The battery life is very short and the batteries don't seem to hold their charge even when the camera and wifi are turned off.Example: I charged the batteries on Tuesday and didn't used the camera for two days. on Thursday I went for a ride and the batteries died in less than an hour.2. This camera doesn't even come with a battery charger. Out of the box the only way to charge the battery is to hook it up to your computer.  So combined with the low battery life and its inability to hold a charge the only way to be sure you have enough battery life is to keep the camera plugged into your computer and your computer on.3. It gets very hot especially when charging. As an electronics engineer I know that this can damage the electronics and the batteries. So while Im trying to keep a full charge I'm damaging my camera. (this is probably the reason there is only a 30 day warranty)4. No low light recording. Even with IR lighting the pictures are terrible. My cell phone takes better low light video.5. No instruction manual. It doesn't come with one. There is one you can download on the internet but it only contains basic instructions.  It doesn't do an adequate job of what many of the features actually do. If you are not a professional you are going to have to do a lot of research in order to get the most out of your camera.6. No lens caps. Honestly how can they not include a lens cap? These cameras cost as much as $400 and they cant include $2 lens cap.7. Professional editing software is necessary.  The free software they include is terrible.That's enough of what I don't like.1. Amazing resolution. Who doesn't like high def?2. slow motion / time laps I havnt played with these features much but when I get around to seriously editing my videos and it should be fun to see what I can do.3. Water resistant case opens up a whole new world to the videographer.4. There is a whole array of mounting hardware that allow you to get professional style angles without the need to expensive equipment. Innovative users have the option to make their own mounting hardware for even more freedom.

After 1/3 mile, I could still see him, but I couldn't hear him on this HT (could hear him fine on my UV-B5).

$review_text.: I was looking at this item for a few days before I made the purchase, because the price was a little more than what I wanted to pay for a shower speaker, but after looking and looking I really didn't find anything that came close to this device (I did see this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IS2636 for $69.99 but it's only a speaker, the Hipe has way more features so I figured for another $10 it's got to be worth it).Let me tell you, I was very pleasantly surprised; this is exactly what I was looking for. The build is very nice; sturdy it feels like a quality product, the sound is superb, crystal clear. I do not seem to have an issue with the Bluetooth being lower than the audio so I guess I got the newer version.  I wasn't expecting such quality sound from a waterproof shower radio. This product exceeded my expectations and the functions are great.I have am iPhone and like another reviewer had mentioned make sure the volume is turned up on your phone (both: while streaming music and while on the phone) if you turn it up once it stays like that forever.I was having a phoncall with my sister and she did not believe that I was in the shower because she didn't hear any background noise, I was really surprised with that because hipe seems to be a NEW company (with a crappy website) and I was really surprised that they have such advanced technology.Pros:- Great Build- Crystal clear sound- Work with siri- Has noise built in cancellationCons:- Not such great mounting features- Fairly new company (although I read reviews and people are saying that they contacted support@hipeusa.com and they get quick answer - but I have not had an issue to have to contact them)

This RAM works and I can tell you it's the correct RAM for a ThinkPad W530 at least. The key thing with RAM is making sure you read all the specs and you're buying what is intended for your computer. Beyond that there's not much. I think it's work spending a couple of extra bucks to buy a known brand like Kingston. I've yet to have any Kingston memory I bought fail on me so that's a good sign.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this AmazonBasic cover for about a month.  It's a "basic" back cover but hey that's what it says in the title.Maybe it's just me but the ipad mini seems way more fragile than the full size ipad...all the materials just seem a little thinner (and my family has already broke one screen).  So I feel every ipad mini must have at least some basic exo-skeleton protection.  When my family goes on road trips I insist the kids use the thicker portfolio style covers.  But for around the house a basic backshell like this Amazon one can be nice...this Amazon shell fits very nice, its very thin so the ipad is still very easy to hold and handle.  The backshell provides some basic protection from scratches to the ipad, light drops, etc.  This cover is the clear color - I've always been a fan of the clear color but lately I'm starting to prefer colored cases because clear doesn't look as clean over time.Overall I rate this Amazon cover 5-stars in consideration of price/value.  At $10 the price is fair for an unobtrusive basic cover that fits the ipad mini well.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to get a reasonably-priced HDMI DVD player that would up-convert ordinary DVDs

 This unit certainly does the job

 The unit came nicely packed with everything I needed to get started


 Literally within 5 minutes I had the unit hooked up and working with my Sharp Aquos 42" LCD TV.The difference in the images is quite remarkable


 I cannot honestly compare this unit to other up-converting units because this is the first one that I have used


 I can say that the menus, the manual, and the overall "touch and feel" of this unit is outstanding
 My few questions were answered right there in the manual, and the menus were simple and straightforward, if not the most elegant looking ones I have ever seen.Another plus for this unit is that it is small and light
 It looks great in our entertainment console; it does not look at all like an "economy" unit, nor is it built like one, although the tray is pretty thin, and will doubtless not take well to abuse


 (So we won't abuse it.)Overall, this one is an economical and effective way to upgrade one's viewing to higher definition.

Sadly, the image from the Blu-Ray player would show for a few seconds and then suddenly go black. Doing some more research revealed that the converter isn't HDCP compliant and thus could not be used in the way that I wanted to use it.So if you are looking to connect a Blu-Ray player to a computer monitor, this is not what you need. You are better off getting a straight DVI to HDMI cable. I purchased one from BlueRigger once I realized this adapter wouldn't work, and that cable works just fine.

$REVIEW.: Although we music fanatics know that speaker critiques are qualitative at best, we still try.The cherry RTiA5 is just beautiful. With the curved enclosure its quite a work of art.As for the sound, balanced is my best description. Highs, midrange and bass are just fine. Nothing exaggerated. Very natural. At low listening levels you can walk about the room and the speakers disappear. Dispersion is terribly wide.A couple of important features: The RTiA5 has a rear facing port, and does poorly flush against the wall. Give them some room the breathe. Also I ran these with a single 150 watt channel. Then tried bi-amplification with 150 watts to the tweeters and another 150 watts to the woofers. The RTiA5 loves the extra power.

$review_text.: Maybe I was expecting something more from a company known for making equipment geared toward pro audio needs. I know the low price point for these reference monitors should have kept my expectations at bay but they really don't sound better than my $50 HK speakers that came with my computer system 4 yrs ago. I am doing minor voice over work and music creation and need good monitors with an at-home budget.The AV30s are self powered so you can crank up the volume pretty loud and still sounds clear. The Bass Boost switch is a joke: Flipping it on is what the sound should be like normally and off shouldn't be an option unless you like flat sound. They are great for casual listening to music or watching movies on your computer but DEF not great for monitoring any real audio like music recording or voice-over work. They have that same "hollow" sound like some cheap boom-box speakers produce. I played some test recordings and every style of music in different positions in my home studio to make sure it wasn't the audio source or room environment but always similar results.Things I liked about the AV30s: Built in amp, solid build, different inputs, came with all cables, pads, affordable price.Things I did not like: Mediocre sound quality, power switch in the back, large size for desktop use.All in all, these monitor speakers are a good deal. Just not the sound quality I need or expected from M-Audio. I have already returned back to Amazon. I will have to bite the bullet and spend the $$$ on higher quality monitors.By the way, what's up with the price on Amazon being higher than on msrp on M-Audio's own website?

So, it's as fast and reliable as my Airport stuff, at least for the short time I used it. Easy to set up with Macs. I cannot speak to its interface with IBM-type PCs. So, if you need a 802.11n router, the current price of 99-bucks seems like a great deal. It is an outdated model (N900 is the latest, I believe) and some of the printed specs seem to indicate you'd be better off with the newer model for 80-bucks more.

$REVIEW.: The uni-body design of the new MacBook is gorgeous and the black keys go back to the unique style of the old Titanium PowerBook

 However, the screen quality is clearly inferior to the Pro version and the lack of matte option is a shame.There are indeed many pluses going for this new iteration of the MacBook

 Unfortunately however, there are far more minuses
 Already mentioned is the noticeably inferior screen (this a a major flaw as the screen is the primary interface to the computer as it is through this that you will be look at all the time)

 The purposeful omission of the FW port is just plain stupid
 This severely cripples the versatility of the Mac

 The price, another major factor, is just ridiculous.Stay away from this version and buy the next one when Apple brings FW back as well as a decent screen with a matte option.

$REVIEW.: My husband is the primary photographer in the family. He uses a digital SLR and has different lenses and set-ups. I was simply looking for a small camera that I could carry in my purse that would allow me to quickly take my own photos or videos without needing to learn a lot of photography stuff like f-stops and ISOs and all that. I think the Panasonic Lumix S3 fit the bill wonderfully!Size and Weight and Appearance: The camera is compact and light and fits easily into my purse without adding much bulk. The camera looks like a basic point and shoot. It does have rounded corners, which make it comfortable to hold and appear a bit more "stylish" than a rectangular camera. The design is pretty basic but seemed fine to me.Screen and Controls: The screen was very clear and big enough for me to navigate around. I thought the controls were pretty intuitive and easy to use. I like that you can use "Intelligent Auto" to take your photos. This is great for an amateur like myself who doesn't want to have to think about what settings I need. I also like that they had choices of different scenes (scenery, baby, party, sunset, snow, sports) that you can select to automatically change the settings on the camera to best suit the environment that you are shooting in. There are 16 different scenes to choose from. The motion picture option was easy to find and select.Photos: I thought the quality of the photos was just fine and I was pleased with the results. I think I need to work more with the optical image stablizer to get used to using it in "action" sequences but I'm sure the learning curve will be pretty short. The menu and navigation around the camera and its various controls was intuitive and helpful. Once you get used to the basic layout of the camera, you can move around and find the features you want to use pretty easily.Videos: You can easily choose the motion picture mode and begin shooting a little movie in seconds. The quality of the videos seemed great to me. I shot a video of my son's Lego game playing on the TV using only natural light and the quality was just fine. I was able to download the video from my memory card and post it on YouTube within minutes without having to make any adjustments. Quick and easy and ideal for sharing -- just what I was looking for!Playback: I like that you can choose to playback your photos in a slideshow or just show by date. The slideshow feature was really nifty because it plays music as it shows your photos. (Although my husband said he can't imagine using this feature, I thought it was still kind of cool!) You can also tag your photos as favorites and choose to just show them. It was easy to delete bad photos if you needed to get rid of photos to make more room on your memory card.Zoom: There is a zoom on the camera but it doesn't zoom in too much as it is only a 4X zoom. However, this seemed OK to me. After all, you can't expect everything on a basic camera.Final Thoughts: Overall, I thought this was a nifty little camera with a nice variety of features that would be perfect for an amateur photographer who is looking for a camera that is easy to use and takes both videos and photos. For a novice photographer like myself who just wants to keep a lightweight camera with them all the time to capture little moments in life, this camera is just perfect. Recommended.

$review_text.: Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile. I'm comparing these cans with only a few other samples to work with. I'm comparing them mainly with the Sennheiser HD 598. I also use casually a few cheaper bluetooth headphones, and a few earphones.Here's the ultimate difference with the Sennheiser: The V-MODA is more based-heavy, more punchy and focused on the lower end. However, overall, the Sennheiser has a more balanced, natural sound. More neutral, more airy, fuller and richer.And yes, I understand the V-MODA is a &#34;closed&#34; type of headphones, while the Sennheiser is the &#34;open&#34; type.The V-MODA definitely looks cooler, comes with an awesome case for traveling, but is also heavier than the Sennheiser.Ultimately, I will keep both, but for different purposes. With its travel case and cool looks, it'll be my travel headphones, while my Sennheiser will be the one I use mainly at home.At $70 on sale, it was too good to pass up or to return.

$REVIEW.: Before the birth of my son, I hardly ever took photos and I was perfectly happy with my iPhone camera.  Then my son was born, and I started taking tons of pictures.  When I printed them, they looked terrible.  They were, after all, mostly taken indoors in low light.  That's when I started shopping around and decided to buy this Panasonic FH25k.I have had it for a year and a half now I believe and overall I am very happy with it.  In outdoor lighting, it gives wonderful pictures with vibrant colors.  I take it to the park all the time and I get great action shot of my son riding bugs and playing.  I have also gotten some nice indoor pictures when the lighting is good (lot of sun coming through the windows).  When the lighting isn't good, the flash works well enough to capture the moment.  Without flash, I have gotten some blurry pictures of my now toddler running around.  It is a tad slow too in indoor light, but not so slow that I have really missed anything.  For a point and shoot I think it is great.  I have used other point and shoots and was never happy with them.  I have taken some videos too, and they look pretty good on the computer screen.  I haven't tried them on my tv yet, but this is leaps and bounds better than my phone camera.A couple of minuses, I do get some red eye sometimes, but I can fix that in iPhoto so it isn't a big deal.  I don't like in camera red eye reduction for toddlers.  He isn't going to sit still while the camera shoots light in his eyes.  Also, sometimes while shooting in very bright light outdoors, I get a flare on the screen.  It isn't super often, and it doesn't come through on the pictures, and that was my main concern when I first saw it.  It is a little irritating, but not a big deal really.It does have a lot of options to choose from , with all the different scene modes, and you can change the iso if you feel like getting into it a little more.  I recently decided to buy an entry level dslr, as having this has re-ignited an interest in photography that I had as a teenager.  Even so, this is small enough that I keep it in my purse so I don't miss anything.  Obviously I'm not going to compare the quality of the two, because they are two different animals, but as a mother who wants a small, light, inexpensive carry everywhere camera, I am very pleased.
$SUMMARY.: Overall, very pleased!

$REVIEW.: This is the second purchase of this model I have made.The most attractive feature of this amp is that it has very quiet and smart automatic switching. When the primary source is switched off, it will self-select the secondary source.  If you use this for public address the primary source will override the secondary background and switch back quickly. The switching is set, perhaps, a bit high.  During a quiet passage the autoswitch will change programs rapidly.  This feature could stand an external sensitivity selector.When there is no source material it will turn itself off after a few minutes.Good full range output power (20Hz - 20kHz), enough for any reasonably efficient speaker pair.  Low distortion too.  Speaker impedance is not a problem; it can handle 4 and 8 ohm systems.  You may use a second set of speakers, but this amp will only allow one pair to be driven at a time: A or B.Two RCA type inputs and one RCA type output for you daisy chainers.The operational lights are small red lights that are completely unobtrusive.It does not get hot at the midpoint of the output volume (the setting I use).The signal source should have an adjustable output since this amp is a slave and has no remote volume adjustablility.Set the volume and balance and leave it hidden.

$REVIEW.: We had Minolta film bodies until just a few years ago, bought our first Sony Omega digital body so we could continue to use our 500 mm reflex lens and other lenses. (Sony acquired the Minolta camera line.) Wife-unit dropped the Sony, fracturing the UV filter and damaging the body.  Camera shop said we would do better to invest in new body.  Hard to believe, but the lens survived.Local shops only sell kits that include new lenses, and not equal to what we had.  Bought the body and with the $100 we saved were able to apply savings to a lens we desired.Really love the panorama and dusk features that stitch multiple shots together.  The dusk feature compiles multiple shots to allow filming in low-light situations without using flash.The camera is much lighter and smaller than previous body, a big bonus.
$SUMMARY.: Now I'm glad we dropped our previous Sony Omega

$REVIEW.: My background; I've had a projector based HD Home Theater with a 10 foot wall painted screen since 2006!  My goal is always to build or upgrade a state of the art HD Home Theater for under $1500.Needed to replace my 1080p HD projector.  Researched all options including 3D.  Results, the  ViewSonic PJD7820 FULL HD / 3D 1080p Projector with HDMI.NOTE: I found the major difference between HD & FULL HD is the screen up to 42 inches & Screen larger than 42 inches respectively.  Wow, was I short changed with my 120 inch screen!  Plus 1700 vs 3000 lumens of brightness & 4000 vs 15000 contrast ratio too! What a significant jump in viewing enjoyment!RULES FOR HOME THEATER for 2014: (Remember - this is a theater not a tv, the darker the room (more theater like) the better & more effectively real it becomes!  BIGGER IS BETTER !)DO's - FULL HD (3D) Projector, FULL HD (3D) BLU-RAY player, HI-SPEED HDMI switch & cables, 3D glasses, a 5.1 or greater HOME THEATER AUDIO SYSTEM & HD Projector (wall) Screen Paint.My system consists of; 7820 projector, BDP-S5100 player, SSG-5100GB 3D glasses, Kinivo 301BN switch, AmazonBasics HDMI cables & Paint on Screen (S1 Ultimate Contrast (also good for 3DHD). COST, $950 less audio.NOTE- includes 4 Hi-speed HDMI cables & 4 pairs of 3D glasses.  ALSO already had 5.1 audio system.DON'Ts- Purchase anything less than the above listed!  WHY? With WIFI you need the most efficient system for HD Wireless Video Streaming! hI-SPEED HDMI handles internet streaming too!  Ignore the internal speaker, it ionly provides 2 watt mono sound, even the audio output is only mono.The 7820 gives you everything!  I will only discuss the TOP FEATURES.  This projector has many auto calibrating features to maximize your best visual experience.  The 7820 has an outstanding picture over 2 million pixels worth.AGAIN, ONLY Hi-speed HDMI cables ( less than 9 meters in length). WHY? Hi-speed provides 3 additional advantages with FULL HD, 1. Supports Ethernet / WIFI video streaming. 2. With FULL HD & Hi-speed HDMI all pixels on a Blu-Ray disc are displayed (more than 2 million). 3. Provides enhanced full features for screens greater than 42 inches!7820 HI-LIGHTS:  PROS-6000 hour lamp life (most have 3-4000 hours)3 year warranty (most have 90 days to 1 year), plus 1 year lamp (most have 90 days) plus a 1 yearexpress exchange service! ( no one else has this!)Best price in its class ($600-700)FULL HD / 3D1 HDMI port ( using a 3 port Hi-speed HDMI switch allows a single cable to the projector!  Minimizeswires to the projector to 2 (power & HDMI). Awesome!Consumers Electronic Control (CEC) may synchronize power on/off via HDMI connection for systemDynamic Movie Function- auto power consumption adjustment of projector lamp use.Magnify feature- magnifies or reduces projected picture size for exact screen size presentation.Auto Sync Feature- auto determines best picture quality for the displayed image.Hi-Speed HDMI connections ONLY for maximum visual / sound stream.Keystone Correction- corrects projected image from projectors position, left, right, high or low.Aspect Ratio- Set to AUTO ONLY.3D SYNC- Auto Syncs 3 D equipment.Must have, 3D Projector, 3D Blu-Ray player Hi-Speed HDMIcables/switch and 3D glasses.CONS-1 HDMI port (see PROS)1 internal 2 watt mono speaker. (Only good for monitoring sound during setup. Recommendation isto ignore it otherwise)Fan Noise- about the same as my previous projectors, not bad. (42 DBS?)NOTE: just a little tid bit of information regarding projector placement.  Thumb Rule is 1.4 x screens width.  Also, 1.4 to 1.8 x screens width is the optimum seating / viewing distance from the screen.PICTURE RATING with FULL HD & HI-SPEED HDMI components ONLY!HD cable - FantasticHD WIFI-  OutstandingHD Blu-Ray- The BEST PICTURE ever!PS3 HD games- Unbelievable3D HD- work in progress/distance/syncing/colorsSCREEN.

This projector has a 6000+ hour lamp life or 8 hours a day viewing time (just like a HDTV) that's almost 3 years before replacement.I hope this review was helpful and gives you an idea about full time theatre/ tv with this outstanding projector!!!ViewSonic did their home work and this is the one!  enjoy.

$review_text.: At the time of this review the pricing for the 64GB model I own is about two  bucks per gig. This time next year it will probably be a fraction of that, and therein is the value of this drive to me.I own a pair of them and use them for rotating back-up. My laptop's 80GB drive is nowhere near full, so this is where I do my daily back-ups. It's not cheaper than CD media, but it's a lot more convenient than swapping discs and definitely quicker. I plug it in at the end of the day and launch a copy script I wrote and - voila! - the machine is backed up. I just overwrite existing files instead of doing an incremental. It's brute force, but also effective. The next day I rotate in the other drive I own, so I always have a back-up that is never more than two days old in case something should happen to one of these.This also works with my Android phones in conjunction with aMicro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0 Adapter. I move the internal memory of my phones to this drive on a weekly basis.Granted, at some point cloud storage will drop to the point where it's more economically feasible than flash drives, but at present physical drive capacity is far cheaper and this is the solution I am going with. It has served me well and this drive has paid for itself a few times when I did need to recreate an entire My Documents directory when my laptop crashed.

$REVIEW.: This product, in every way except being white, is identical to the New Trent IMP50D but is much less expensive (I have both). It powers/charges a 1G iPad nicely and any other USB device I've tried it with. Be warned, with both this and the New Trent version, it won't supply TWO power hungry devices at once. It's real output is 1 amp combined between the two jacks not the 1 amp plus 0.5 amp (1.5 A) claimed. So an iPad alone (or some of the more power hungry phones) will max it out by themselves. But that's not a big drawback. It's great to bring on flights, throw in your backpack, etc. for lots of reserve power.And, as an aside, this is about the cheapest device of this kind I'm comfortable with. Just Google "lipo fire" and you'll find out what cheaply made Lithium Poly batteries, as are in all of these devices, can do when things go wrong. They catch fire, explode, shoot flames at 1000+ degrees, and more. Houses and cars have burned to the ground, flights have made emergency landings, etc. So buyer beware. It's best to buy from a company with an established brand name and some assets in the USA. New Trent seems to be such a company, and this seems to be an "OEM" version of the product they sell.

$review_text.: I've been building gaming PCs a few years now (So understand my review is based on its Gaming performance, not productivity), since I was about 13, working with the cheapest parts I can get my hands on, but also the most powerful for that money. Now that I'm 19 however, I get a bit more cash, but I still tend to go for the "Best performance for the money" camp of PC parts. My latest build was using a EVGA GTX 670 with an AMD Phenom II x4 @ 3.0Ghz with some decent 8GB of RAM. This wasn't a terrible setup, playing all the latest games at usually max settings, but typically falling into 30FPS, sometimes less. While this was fully playable, I couldn't help but feeling I wasn't getting the full Oomph from my system. I was on a budget, and came across the AMD FX-8350 as being nicely powerful for the money. I bought it from Amazon for about $190 ($216 with tax and free shipping) and was fairly confident, after reading reviews, that this would be a very welcome upgrade for my PC.I typically for that most games had an FPS increase at max settings of about 10-30 FPS when compared to my quad core. While this doesn't give me my dream 60 FPS in all games, it's a welcome increase none the less. Here are a few differences with my new cpu:Far Cry 3-Max settings, 1080p: average of about 45 FPS, a low of 35 FPS. (Used to be average of 40 FPS, a low of 26 FPS)Borderlands 2- Max settings, full Physx, 1080p: Average of 60 FPS easily, found nothing lower (Used to be an average of 60, but would quickly drop to 20-30 FPS due to Physx. With the new CPU, that's no longer a problem)GTA 4- Max settings, 720p: Average of about 50 FPS, a low of 38 FPS (Used to be an average of 40 FPS, with a low of 24 FPS)Just Cause 2- Max Settings, 1080p: Average of 60 FPS, a low of 55 FPS (Used to be an average of 50 FPS, with a low of 38 FPS)DayZ- Max settings, 20 player server, 720p: Average of about 50 FPS, a low of 35 FPS (Used to be an average of 45 FPS, with a low of 22 FPS)As you can see, I got some nice increases in all the listed games, and still have a few more to test. While I wasn't blown away by the performance increase, I was very happy to see a difference in games.As far as negatives go, the fan sucks. Bad. It gets REALLY loud when it gets to about 50C, and it can get pretty hot, with the highest so far I've seen being 60C on very CPU intensive games. I plan on buying a new cooling unit, and so should you unless 60C really doesn't bother you.Overall, for under $200, it's a decent CPU, and seems to outperform my friends i5 in most games, especially if it support more than 2 or 4 cores (such as Crysis 2 and 3)
$SUMMARY.: A nice upgrade, but not required.

$REVIEW.: Okay, so I reviewed theAmazonBasics Silicone Case with Tread for iPod touch 4th Genonce upon a time and decided to give this bad boy a comparison review.  It's approximately $3 more, and here's what you get for that.  A sweet, stylish flip-open case for your precious music that offers complete protection from anything short of a gunshot and a detachable clip so that you can hook it straight to your pants or belt for easy access.  The leather case does not stick like the treaded silicone, but slides smoothly in and out of pocket and the flip-open cover has a little magnet in it so that it remains closed until you intentionally open it.  The only thing that the silicone case does better is that you have to remove the iPod from the leather case in order to put it on a dock of any sort.  So basically, I'll be using both.  When I'm listening to my iPod on the move or out doing yardwork, this will be my choice for protection.  But when I go to work (where I have an iPod dock), the the silicone case is more convenient.  All in all, both cases offer solid protection and stylishness, but this leather case provides superior overall protection, comfort, the option of a belt clip, and it looks like a million bucks to boot.  Given the choice of the two in terms of quality, this one wins, but which one is preferable to you depends on how you are going to use your iTouch. Either way, enjoy.
$SUMMARY.: Wicked protection.

$REVIEW.: For the movie-maker on a tight budget, this gadget will do the job and do it well.  The software can be finicky, as it won't recognize another Flip camcorder and will crash, forcing you to retrieve the video straight from the camera's internal folders.  The video quality is top-notch, but if you're looking for HD or advanced video editing, you might want to save a few extra hundred and get a more professional camcorder.  Also, do not record any lengthy clips as they will not transfer to your computer; keep them down to a few minutes at most.  No memory cards or tapes needed, it's a handy tool needing only 2 AA batteries.  For more versatility, as in a short tripod, an action mount, or an underwater case, you will need to put a few more dollars into the Flip Ultra.A great camcorder for the price.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this player a few days ago. Set up was a little confusing, but I managed to get it right. I have Amazon Prime, so many videos are free ... great value for me. I also have Netflix streaming only. Both are a breeze to download and watch. Do wish Amazon had a "Queue" to store videos in like Netflix. I have it wired via HDMI to a Panasonic 37" 1080 dpi LCD. Regular cable (Cox) picture quality is not bad. Most DVD's I have streamed are HD, and picture quality is very good. I don't subscribe to digital cable, so my quality on TV suffers there. This is a good product, but does require direct wired or wireless connection. I use wireless via a Linksys router. The unit will get hot if left plugged in. I unplug mine after use ... which is no big deal at all. Very pleased with this unit.

$review_text.: I've tried four different covers from different companies since buying my Kindle Fire last year and this one is the keeper.  My Fire fits in very snugly (there are four elastic corners that hold it in securely) and I have no fear that it will fall out.  The cover itself is beautiful and I've already received comments from others asking where I got it.  There is a little pocket on the inside front cover that you can slip paper into, if needed.  All in all, this Verso cover will be the one I'll be recommending if anyone asks.

Mic is located near the chest and makes it difficult for a clear audio to be recorded. Reebok armband is quite handy though and if you are serious about exercising then these are worth the money. Otherwise I would recommend that you go for MIE2

$review_text.: 160GB HDD storage!  5.1 surround sound!  Built-In USB!  GPS!So those are the positives and they are somewhat impressive.  However, keep in mind that it is HDD storage and NOT solid state memory.  You'll need to insert a SD card into the included SD card slot if you want solid state memory.Sony has decided to place the microphone pickups right at the front (under the lens) which means that you are near certain to pickup wind noise while recording.  In fairness, it was minimal but it was evident.Battery use is fast and depletes faster than solid state because of the HDD moving parts.  Carry a backup.BUT....  What is most important is the quality of the video.  This camcorder has so many positives but when it comes to picture quality, you'll find a severe lack of pixel resolution.  Colors will be impressive and even low light indoor video came in with impressive results.  The negative was sub-par video.  Just no details.  No sharpness.  Low lines of resolution.  We used both 60i and 60p.  Maximum quality settings and as said, got great colors but just no details.  Can't see a human hair, a flower, a garden leaf or a blade of grass.  Playback was using HDMI to a 1080p TV.Sony did a fairly good job of including massive storage, 5.1 sound and GPS.  What I wanted mostly was resolution and this model doesn't offer that.I did not use the photo/still aspect as I purchased a camcorder and not a digital still camera.

$review_text.: When I received this case, I was genuinely impressed with the packaging: it entirely encased in a box which completely protected it in transit (unlike a few other cases I had ordered). The package whispered, "class." Nonetheless, when I slid the case out of the box, I was stunned at the plastic texture. And, it appears as "cheap" as it feels. In fact, there is large, visible ripple in the back of the case where one folds it. So, even when the case is closed, it has the appearance of water damage. The elastic strap (as seen on Moleskine products), it a nice touch to keep the case closed, but it simply cannot make up for the fact that the case is genuinely flawed in design.On a positive note, the inside is a similar grey color, but is a very soft, protective fabric.As noted by another reviewer, without a pre-made crease, it is awkward to fold this product and it really does make the product less and less attractive the more one uses it. Disappointing.There are a number of fantastic cases on the market. This is definitely not one of them. Hey, you already invested in your Kindle, why not invest just a bit more to keep it safe and show it off?

$REVIEW.: I bought this battery from ATC LLC for around $22


I did the normal charge and discharge cycles to keep the battery cells healthy
In total, I must have done it at least ten times

Later on, I kept it plugged in a bit longer even after it fully charged because I knew I would move around shortly after


A couple weeks through ownership, I noticed that it would charged to 39% and said it was still charging


After half an hour of web browsing, it still said that

I then decided to unplug the charger and my computer shut off completely
I then contacted ATC LLC and they gave me a prepaid return label and are refunding me

Customer service was great, not so much the battery.When it was working, I could watch three hours of movies/videos with my laptop on High Performance power settings (I have a quad-core HP Pavilion dv6z)

Gaming was about the same and web browsing while listening to music can get you five to six hours on HP Recommended power settings

Still, it ended up failing on me

My advice, go with an genuine HP version (from Amazon of course) if you have the cash to avoid the problems generic units tend to have.

This is the type of software that gets better the more you use it. There is so much that can be done with this if a person takes the time to learn.

$review_text.: This gets five stars because it does what it says it does. If you have a tablet that has a custom dock available from the manufacturer, however, the custom dock might be the better option.I used this on my windows tablet and found:Good:-setup was fast and easy-I could hook up to an HDMI monitor using my own (not included) display port to HDMI adapter-I could hook up to a VGA monitor using the DVI to VGA adaptor (included)-The USB ports all worked for Keyboard, mouse, and attached storage-This worked OK even with a USB 2.0 port on my old tabletNot as good:-This doesn't charge your tablet directly. If your tablet can be charged via a USB port you can use one of the USB 3 ports on the dock to charge your unit, but that is another wire to hook up. If your tablet has a different charger then you plug that in from elsewhere. This is where the manufacturer's dock is somewhat better. Typically you just dock your tablet and everything is connected and the tablet is being charged without wires being attached.This unit is nicely built and is a good option if you don't have an option of an affordable dock for your tablet. It can also be used with a laptop as long as you have room to put your laptop next to the dock instead of on the dock. There is a similar unit for laptops that allows you to put the laptop on top but I think the only difference is the support.

$review_text.: Update 7/9/13On 6/24/13 a vertical blue line (one column of pixels) appeared near the center of the screen

I called Sharp and got through rapidly


They had me reboot, push several buttons, and read them the data from the screen
Then they had me take pictures


Shortly thereafter, they called to say that they will replace the set, including delivery and installation


I will update once this is done.Update 5/3/13The set is still working perfectly

Pictures from DVD and Bluray are superb!! We are watching Homeland on standard DVD from Netflix
It looks like we are in the studio!  On Bluray, my favorite test is the Rolling Stones IMAX disc


Wow!!On the web side, I am now using a Microsoft K800 wireless keyboard and mouse

It works perfectly
I did add an 18" USB extension cord so that the wireless dongle attached to the set now hangs a bit below the TV and hence has a clearer RF path to the keyboard/mouse
I was able to use the TV's browser to stream the Sanford/Colbert-Bush debate the other night
The off-the-air TV is great also

Picture is superb
The sound exposes the problems at our local TV stations in Savannah
Most insist on transmitting fake "surround sound" instead of pure stereo or mono.I asked Sharp about forcing the set into pure stereo or mono mode per the instructions on page 17 of the manual


They indicated that the TV can only toggle between sound modes actually sent by the station

Since our local stations only send "surround", I am stuck with that

(BTW - The Sharp online question services are great


They provide good answers in a day or so via email.)Overall, I would say that this set is so good that it exposes problems in poor source material.______________I bought the 70LCLE650u about 2 weeks ago, and it is fantastic! I'll write a longer general review when I get more experience with it


I used the Amazon free delivery, and it was here in SC in about 5 days.I don't have HD Sat or cable, but off the air HD from NBC (Savannah)is outstanding
I also tried a Bluray disc of the Rolling Stones on IMAX (via a separate multi-channel sound system)and picture quality is superb.The sound from the built-in speakers is poor (as expected), so I rigged up a homemade sound bar using a Lepai 2020a amplifier (about $25 from Amazon) and a Zuni ($15 from Amazon) smart strip that turns on the amp when the TV comes on, and off when the TV goes off

That drives a pair of ancient AR2ax's for normal TV news watching
A normal sound bar will also do the trick


I especially like that the set remembers separate volume settings in each input mode.Wireless setup was easy, although I had to turn on my wireless beacon or the TV would not detect the SSID

It did not want to accept manual input of the SSID.I tried a Logitech K520 wireless keyboard (from my main PC) on the browser, and it works as expected
A real keyboard such as this is far,far superior to using the Sharp on-screen keyboard

This rig is not a replacement for a PC, but Google searches and movie data look-ups, and news work just fine


I'll now buy a smaller wireless keyboard.My two pearls of wisdom thus-far:1 - Be prepared to use outboard speakers

The sound of the built in speakers on any of these flat-screens, especially with thin bezels is wretched.2 - If you are going to use the browser, buy a real wireless keyboard.So far, so good


This set offers a tremendous picture for a good price.Thanks all for the soap opera info
That is my next step.Steve

$REVIEW.: For under $8 this case can't be beat

We have purchased 3 different cases for different tablets, and so far, this is my favorite.It is not real leather, but rather PU leather (I had to look it up -  thin layers of leather treated with polyurethane), so in the long run it may be less durable, but it seems really well made.The tablet fits inside a "frame", the exterior is PU leather and the interior is microfiber


I have the impression that this holds the tablet in place much more securely than the cases using bungees (we have other cases with bungees, that seem to hold the tablet well, but it is not uncommon to have one corner come off when you fiddle with the controls on the tablets - not a problem with this case).As many people have mentioned, it does add to the thickness of the tablet, but to me it is still very good - significantly thinner and lighter than most paper daily planners


It feels like a small note-book.It closes very well - it seems to me with a magnetic closure, which also automatically puts the tablet to sleep when closed


Although it doesn't feel that it would stand too well to bending the cover totally backwards (for example, if you want to use it as a reader), to me it feels very comfortable to use it as an open book.The stand works well, although I  don't feel it has the range shown in the picture

The tablet has to be much closer to the edge of the case to be at a comfortable angle (the stock pictures show it being more towards the middle - but if you put it on that position, the tablet is angled at almost 90 degrees)
That being said, it feels pretty stable as a stand.Many users mention that different ports and switches are covered by the case, but most of those reviews seem from around September 2012

My guess is that the first cases that came out were defective, and that they've corrected the defects, as the one I received fits perfectly well.I really like the case, and considering an under $10 the price, it is a no-brainer.

$REVIEW.: I like the design of this player


 It's simple and easy to carry

 I own this thing for almost 6 months and the best thing so far it's it acts as a removable drive and USB key
 Whenever I need to transfer any data/songs I can just plug it in a USB, no cables needed or what so ever
 The sound quality is decent with above average earbuds, but they are a bit big for any human ears and the cable is too long

 I don't like the swing around the neck earbuds, I snapped one earbud already

 Customer service is quite responsive through email, except when you request an RMA.Navigation of this player is quite simple and easy to use
 No need to use the manual

 Like I said, it also acts as a removable drive, so you don't even need to install its so so software, just copy and paste or drag and drop files.The only things it lacks are line-in recording and a hold button
 Yes, the Creative nano plus has line-in and everything the MuVo has, but after 6 months of use, I can not emphasize enough the importance/convenience of the USB key function.All in all, I'm please with the MuVo and I bought another one of 1GB, 512MB didn't seem to be enough memory, but 1GB appears perfect

 If you want a player with decent sound quality that's easy to use and convenient to carry this is it

 If you want more function and features look at iaudio U3/G3 or Samsung T8.

$review_text.: This sped my laptop up like crazy. I already had a pretty fast laptop (MSI GT60) but I loaded up the OS onto it and from logging in to running a program is only 5 seconds. It's great! There is however only 230GB of usable space when you get it so beware of that. Also the instructions were rather terrible despite the nice graphics. THIS SSD DID NO COME WITH THE DATA TRANSFER CABLE like it shows pictured in the instructions. Had to use a friends. No bios instructions left me having to format my two 500gb hard drives and I ended up selling them to get a 1TB.

The laptop is working as expected too, will not make a big review, just to say that is a very good machine.Some reviews are saying that the sound is not good quality, and that made me doubt to buy it but honestly the sound is very very good with two Harman Cardon speakers. Of course you will not get high bass sound due to the vibration that can affect the machine components like the hard drive but is very configurable.Just one cons: the webcam, is worst than a 1990 webcam, that bad it is, all the rest perfect and smooth.Happy with this laptop I recommend it.

$review_text.: I saw the rebate offer and said to myself, "what the heck, I'll get this as a back-up wi-fi adapter."  Over the weekend I played wtih it and let me tell you, this thing just does not work.  It simply cannot connect to any wi-fi AP.  Its reception capability is even worse than the built-in 802.11b in my 2-year-old Fujitsu laptop.  I literally held the laptop right next to my AP and this thing still couldn't detect it.  When I went to a public place with lots of hotspots -- I know it because my Fujitsu and the Netgear WG511 PC Card work totally fine there -- this thing connected only once but then dropped after five minutes.I thought I got a defective unit, until I read the reviews here on Amazon.  Apparently this is just a bad product.  It's not even worth the after-rebate price of $9.

$REVIEW.: (Update:Since my first four-star review, the product failed. It performed flawlessly for 10 days, and suddenly it dropped the connection to the router and the radio indicator light went off.The router itself was still alive, everything but this product was able to connect to the router wirelessly.Power cycling this unit sometimes recovers the connection for a short while.And worst of all, the reset button didn't work. After pressing the reset button for 30 sec or so when the power was on, it looked like it still had the connection information from the original setup, connected to the router (I know from the router's log), and dropped. It simply refuses to forget everything and revert back to the default setting. I kept trying to reset, but never once did this unit go back to the default 192.168.10.110 IP address.When something like this happens I would normally request an exchange as one bad unit doesn't necessarily mean that all units are bad, but in this case I was purchasing through "fulfilled by amazon" sellers, and Amazon say these sellers can only refund, not exchange, so I'm just requesting refund and will buy a different product from Amazon.)The following is the original review titled "Was actually simple to set up".I wanted to connect my desktop PC upstairs to the router downstairs wirelessly, and this thing is working nicely for this purpose. I was half expecting a setup nightmare because I've read many reviews stating that the setup is not simple, but actually I only spent less than 10 minutes and I was already connected. Let me explain what I did (I used Linux for this but the concept is the same for any OS).1. Connect the PC with the bridge using an ethernet cable.2. Manually set the IP address of the PC to 192.168.10.2. Anything would have worked as far as it was 192.168.10.x where x is larger than 0, smaller than 255, and not 110. I had to stop the networking of the PC and then restart it to force the IP address to be changed.3. Open a browser and access the bridge, 192.168.10.110.4. Type in the default user name and password, which is "admin" and "admin".5. Without using the wizard, go to the "network" setting, click "LAN setting".6. Change the mode to "DHCP client" from "static IP".7. The bridge reboots, but the IP address doesn't change because the bridge couldn't connect to the wireless router yet.8. Open 192.168.10.110 again and this time go to "wireless", then "site survey".9. My router's ESSID was already displayed there. Select it and press "connect".10. Enter password for the router's wireless encryption.11. The bridge restarts. This time the connection between the PC and the bridge is lost, because the bridge itself has a new IP address in 192.168.1.XXX range that was given by my router but the PC still has a static 192.168.10.2 IP address.12. Change the PC's network setting from static to DHCP. After this, I had to stop the networking of PC and start it again to force the PC to try to get an IP address using DHCP.That's it. Sure this was not a  hands-free experience but it was not that complicated either. More importantly, the bridge's behavior made sense to me in each and every step. I've never had that familiar "OMG nothing makes sense" feeling even for a second in the process. And it took me less than 10 minutes (probably it was more like 5 minutes maximum from the start to the end).I'm taking away one star because it seems like only the 5GHz channels are displayed in "site survey" list.

$REVIEW.: I bought the acer c720 vice the samsung and hd becuase of its haswell architecture and the speed of the system. It is a very good system with instant on capability, long battery life and with the google chrome, a secure web browser which is a must especially these days. The unit doesnt seem as solidly built as the samsung, but overall its a pretty decent little computer that has apps which try and emulate the windows standards. It doesnt have a floppy disk drive, but it does have 2 usbs and a scandisk drive. Sotrage space is limited, but you could always just buy a heavy gb usb or if youre so inclined, cloud you basic info and usb/backup your more pertinent info. The keyboard is missing a shift key as well as a return, but after about 5-7 minutes you get used to the keyboard, theres also a pretty decent finger mousepad with other options as well, either way for 200 dollars you cant beat it and if youre practical, it will do 90% of what a full-fledged laptop will do at a much lower price point. i woulddefinately recommend over an apple type computer just based on price alone if buying for your kids school.

$REVIEW.: This is my third PixelFlash product, and once again I am simply amazed by the quality, speed and price! Full disclosure: I received an evaluatory sample of this product from PixelFlash. This is my unbiased opinion.Honestly, it's hard to sound unbiased when dealing with such a stand-up company and its products. I get mediocre products for review all the time (and leave star ratings accordingly), but looking through all of PixelFlash's products, a negative review is hard to find. This card is no different.THE SPECSHere's a quick rundown of the important specifications/points you need to know about this CF Card:- 64GB Capacity (a pro or con depending on who you ask)- UDMA 7 (Ultra Direct Mode Access 7, is the latest transfer mode under the UDMA interface. UDMA 7 allows a maximum transfer rate of up to 167MB/sec.)- 533x  Speed of over 80MB/s (which = transfer rate x 150kb/s)- HD Video-ready- Compatible with virtually any camera brandTHE CARDJust some of my short notes on the card itself:- Carries a lifetime warranty- Personally have tested it in the 1DS Mk-II, 5D, 7D and 50D with no issue- Works flawlessly for video, just fast enough to do RAW video with ML Firmware- Insanely-fast transfers both in-camera and to computer- That price...*So far I have shot several hours of HD 1080p footage, as well as several thousand images on my PixelFlash card. I have had no stuttering in playback, no corrupted or lost images, NO issues whatsoever. I'm a wedding photographer, so I don't use high-capacity cards for my pro work (to reduce loss of irreplaceable images) but I have used this for shots that would be inconvenient to retake, and I absolutely trust this card 100%*PRICEJust for comparison, I have rounded up a few comparable CF cards in the same speed range. All prices are accurate at the time of this writing. Starting of with our card:64GB PixelFlash 533x UDMA-7- $87.9964GB Lexar Professional 400x UDMA-7- $155.90 (25% slower write speeds and almost twice as expensive)64 GB Transcend 400x UDMA-7- $96.78 (25% slower write speeds and $10 more expensive)64GB SanDisk Extreme Pro UDMA-6$343.72 (12% faster write speeds, nearly four times the price)OVERALLI think you'll start to see just HOW great of a deal these PixelFlash cards are. You are getting better or comparable speeds to big name manufacturers for sometimes a QUARTER of the price. Add in a lifetime warranty and reports of excellent customer service, and it's hard to imagine reasons to stay with the bigger names. I still have plenty of Sandisk cards laying around (the company I'm most loyal to), but the Pixelflash is my daily-user. I'll be buying several of their small-capacity cards for my wedding photography, I'm that sold on the quality of these cards.Highly recommended without ANY reservations.*UPDATE*I have now been using this card for two months, on a near-daily basis. I have shot countless hours of HD footage on my Canon 50D, and more pictures than I care to admit (magic lantern rekindled my love for time lapse). So far I have had no issues whatsoever. Even with my Sandisk cards, I'll get one corrupted image out of every 5,000 and I honestly haven't encountered one with the Pixelflash card. That's not to say it won't happen eventually as the flash memory is put through increasing cycles, but for now I'm beyond pleased.

$REVIEW.: Samsung LN40B630 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of ColorI watched the prices of this Samsung model (last year's Consumer Reports top choice of LCD 40") for the last year as my 32" Sony CRT TV was slowly dying.  This TV was offered at $999. with a free Blu Ray Sylvania DVD player and a free HDMI cable, with free shipping and no sales tax.  This package saved me about $300. over the nearest competitor (Sears- selling the same TV at the same price, but with sales tax and no free companion products).This is a great TV!  The "Touch of Color" around the body is an attractive feature- much nicer than just shiny black plastic.  All TV functions are impressive improvements over old fashioned analog CRT TVs.  The fast 120 hz. refresh rate makes even the fastest action scenes clear and blur free.  The sound is also good, with plenty of adjustments to suit the acoustics of most rooms.We are very happy with this purchase.

$review_text.: The RX1 has one of the top sensors of all time.  It also has one of the best (if not the best) 35mm FF lenses of all time.  They provide a one-two punch capable of producing the best photography (from a technical perspective) ever, to date.  Of course, ultimately it is the photographer that makes a photo.  A great photographer can make a great photo with a camera phone.  A rookie photographer surely can take thousands of crappy photos with this camera.The build quality is exceptional.  Basically all is magnesium, rubber or glass, except for the battery door and plug input door, which are plastic.  It feels like a brick, which is good to help stabilize the hold.  It has no image stabilization, but most lenses of 35mm or shorter do not.  The P and A buttons typically settle on 1/80 shutter speed.  Generally that is good enough.  However there is no minimum shutter speed setting.  The work-around is to work in M mode, set shutter speed to 1/100 or 1/125 or more and leave on Auto ISO and then set the aperture ring (which is on the lens) to whatever you want to compose the picture.  The camera has amazing ISO noise control up to the default 6400 ISO so this manual mode technique can be quite effective most of the time except in bright light, when you have to be a bit more active controlling the shutter speed dial.  The MF, AF and DMF (AF w/ MF override when shutter release is half depressed) knob is on the front of the camera.  PASM and Exposure Correction knobs are on top.  Shutter dial is on the back up top + a bunch of programmable buttons and thumb dial are on back.  Enormous amount of customization is possible.The menu is quite intuitive and is modeled after that of the Sony Alpha DSLRs.  The LCD is quite bright with very high resolution.  Battery life is so-so, generally allowing 150 - 200 images between charges.  It also has a pop up flash.  However, due to the bright lens and great noise handling characteristics at high ISO, the flash may rarely be needed. The RAW files produced are exceptional providing magnificent Dynamic Range.  There is tremendous resolution from the 24.3MP sensor... and combine that, once again, with that beautiful extremely sharp lens with creamy bokeh and amazing images can be produced.The RX1 fits a very specific need... someone that uses and appreciates the 35mm Full Frame focal length, is seeking incredible Image Quality in a very small form factor.  If you are not a real photo enthusiast you will find the very short depth of field (at f/2) a challenge to focus.  This camera has CDAF technology like most mirrorless cameras.  The shallow DOF further exposes the limitations of CDAF for auto-focusing if the subject is not fairly still.  If you are aware of this fact before buying, it is a camera limitation you learn to work with.  All cameras have limitations.  The other obvious limitation is it is a fixed lens.  If you want an amazing IQ small camera with a 35mm focal length because you either want it on you most of the time or you travel a lot... or you just love photographing with 35mm on non-active subjects... and if you do indoor photography a lot and need a bright lens with a camera sensor that has amazing noise handling, the RX1 may be the camera for you.  It is a very unique type of camera and has the potential to be a classic.  It also has the potential to hold its value for a long time.  "Potential" does not mean "definitely"If you think you are buying an amazing point and shoot Cybershot to photograph your young children DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.  The auto-focus will disappoint unless you know you have the skill to photograph young children with manual focus (which, by the way, while the lens is focus by wire, it is smooth and buttery with just the right resistance on the RX1).The RX1 is 3 thumbs up if you are the right individual with the right unique needs.

$review_text.: I recently bought a Panasonic ZS15 (little brother of the ZS20, same size but slightly different specs) and really struggled to find a case which would fit it; the cases were either for smaller cameras or would be too bulky for this camera. I tried Case Logic's camera case finder and, to be honest, they weren't much help either; they suggested all the larger cases, and I didn't want that. Then I came across this case, and saw the reviews saying that it fits the Flip camcorder really well. I looked at the Flip dimensions and found that they're about the same as the ZS15 and ZS20, so I got this case.It is perfect for this camera; the camera fits snuggly and yet easily. The 'hard' side of the case we tend to use for the lens side of the camera, having had previous experience of Panasonic lens covers messing up over time; but it can fit either way. It seems a solid, good case, and I'm happy with this purchase.

I had bought it on the thought that it would be good to pack in my suitcase and have available when I'm in a location where I have limited access to outlets for phone, laptops, tablets, etc.  I'm not saying that I still can't do that, but it's definitely bigger than I expected.  At home I keep it right under the edge of my couch and use it to plug in the devices I previously mentioned.

I just popped this guy right into my system and there I was enjoying better graphics so yes I do recommend this card for anyone who needs to upgrade from an older card but does not want to spend a lot.***Update 6/15/12***: This card still rocks! it has delivered great performance and plays tons of games. My system currently: Intel core 2 duo e7500(2.93 ghz), 6GB Ram, and this card. Overall I have seen many improvements in my systems speed plus more and more games i can finally play now!. Also, UPDATE to the latest drivers which now are at 301.42. With the current drivers I have seen a performance increase in gaming and with Nvidia's new technology fxaa, this card has brang all the games i play to their knees. Overall, still a very worthwhile purchase.***Update 1/4/2014***: This Card is still working! though now it is old and the Drivers are not the best for it, I would have to say 314.22 has been the most rock solid for this card. I have since though past the computer containing this card onto my brother so this will be my last update but my bro says he loves it over his old HP that had a 6 series card.

$review_text.: It was a tough decision between the famous Tamron 90mm f2.8 macro and the new Pentax 100mm f2.8 macro. Decided on the Pentax  despite ~50% higher price: WR, 49mm filter, lighter and more compact, all metal outside, excellent sharpness across the field and one stop down from 2.8 (still very-very good at 2.8, compare the graphs for the Tamron and Pentax on LensTips). The fact that protruding front lens is completely hidden inside the hood makes it very handy for street-candids-portraits. On the same note, it's much less flashy than the Tamron - no gold lettering with bright blue stripe (the actual lens looks extremely "handsome" - elegant black with silver lettering that is there but doesn't jump into your eyes.The looks was the least concern for me but I feel obliged to congratulate the designers. I am familiar with optics and glass making but as the end user I don't care how many optical elements it contains as long as it produces sharp images, fits into my pants/shirt pocket, doesn't weigh 2 lb and can be used in the field w/o special precautions. This lens was designed using top-notch technology with photographers in mind. Minimal weight, nothing sticks out, the focusing ring is at the end of the lens, an additional central groove makes it very tactile - easy to find w/o looking and easy to turn w/o slipping - it just "sticks" to your fingers.The lens is really compact and sits well on K-5, easy focusing. Sample pics were taken handheld 1/500 around 6pm under partially cloudy sky with AWB.I don't miss the aperture ring but I would appreciate a focus limiter (was focus hunting 3-4 times out of 50) and slit in the hood for CPL. Also the price is on a steep side, thus minus 0.5 star in the total rating. To avoid focus hunting someone here suggested to pro-focus manually and then go to auto, hope that will work.Amazon price and delivery was up to their usual unusually high standards, paid for 2 day shipment, got it next day.

$REVIEW.: This card is just what I've been looking for.  I've been using the Gmyle card for a while, but after updating to 10.9, that card would no longer work, even after installing the USB3 drivers from Multibeast.  I could have searched around for more drivers, but honestly, all the hassle that came with that card just wasn't worth it.  In order to recognize a new drive plugged in, the old card would need you to shut down (or sleep) your laptop, then wake it up, THEN you could use your new drive.With this card, I can simply plug in the USB DC power cable, then pop in the expresscard itself with my USB3 hard drive plugged in, and it shows up instantly on my desktop.  I love when things just work!  The Fresco chipset is to thank for that, since OSX has native support for Fresco.I'm even getting faster speeds with this card than I was with the Gmyle card, likely due to the USB power assistance, and the native support.  You'll experience the best results with a laptop with ExpressCard 2.0, since it has a single PCIe 1.0 2.5Gbps land AND a USB3 5Gbps link.Anyhow, if you have a 2011 MacBook Pro with ExpressCard, this card pretty much eradicates the need for a laptop upgrade.  My 2.3GHz Sandy Bridge quad-i7 puts out almost as much horsepower as the current lineup, and even more than Haswell in some situations, so with USB3, my antiglare 17&#34; MBP is the ultimate machine.
$SUMMARY.: Works with 2011 MacBook Pro 17" natively (no drivers needed!)

$review_text.: I am ABSOLUTELY thrilled I purchased them. They were professionally installed to my factory NAV stereo system. They produce "live-studio" quality sound with clear separation between notes and a powerful response. You will hear all of the instruments. It impressed the pros to ask me where to get them. And, they told me about the top-grade materials/workmanship used in manufacturing. There's zero distortion when I crank-up the volume (3/4 max) before my ears bleed. I will need a remote and some serious distance to go to max volume.  I am not an audiophile but I have paid the money for (Denon, Yamaha, Onkyo, Nakamichi, Bose, B&O;, etc.) stereo equipment. It's truly high-end audio-quality sound without spending all that money.Like others, I heard the cautious "don't buy MB Quart because" they were bought by Maxxsonics and are (1). No longer a German company (2). The quality is not good. But FIRST, No one that said this to me ever heard or installed them. SECOND, Maxxsonics is an American (California) company and if I am going to take a chance on quality then why not American? THIRD, the speakers are still manufactured in Germany. FOURTH, the Premium-Series is 3 levels above their "factory-installed" speaker replacement recommendation.Lastly, I called Maxxsonics because I got a lot of conflicting installation advice. Also, I needed one extra measurement that I could not find anywhere else. Not only did they answer the phone but they quickly pulled the speaker out of the box to get the information I needed. We talked about configurations and sorted thru all the stuff I was told. They knew I was buying the speakers from someone else and they sent a follow-up email afterwards. That translates to excellent customer service.Here's my setup: a Jeep Liberty (2002-2006) with factory-installed NAV stereo system. The factory amps found in the front doors were connected to the MBs. The speaker openings are larger than 6.5 inches so adaptive brackets were used. The tweeters fit perfectly. Forget what anyone says - you do not have to buy shallow-mount speakers for the rear doors. The factory-speakers we pulled out were full-sized. The MB crossovers have 4 settings (0, -1, -3 and -5). I chose zero because I usually set treble at +2. To test the speakers I burned a cd with songs that had lots of transitions, deep-deep bass lows and really-high end notes. The MBs played it like I was sitting in front of a live band. There's no other stereo equipment in my car. Anybody can spend $5k and get great sound - but do it for less than $500.I think one reviewer said it best " BUY THEM."

$REVIEW.: I bought my wife an inexpensive no-name MP3 player (also hot pink) a couple of months ago. It worked for about a week and thereafter developed problems with the on-off switch. Amazon, to their credit, quickly refunded our purchase price, including the cost of return shipping. She has had the Sony Walkman for several weeks now and it has performed well thus far. It was roughly twice the price of the other player, but, at least so far, is worth the additional cost. Over the decades, I've been pleased with the Sony products I've owned and considered their consistently good quality to justify the additional expense.Prior reviews praised the speakers. They're better than most, but, at least in our experience, about what you'd expect with small speakers. If the player continues to operate for years as it has in the few weeks she's had it, I'd be inclined to rate it more highly (i.e., 5 stars).

$REVIEW.: This modem is easy to setup and only took me a couple of minutes to get it going out of the box

Once you get it working with your ISP provider, this modem provides pretty reliable and strong internet speeds and wifi connection.I used it to replace my old modem + router, and am very happy with this new setup
The speed is a little faster, it takes up less space than both modem and router combined, and looks nice

One thing to note is that this device doesn&#8217;t have a telephone connection, so that might be a deal breaker for some people.Overall I haven&#8217;t had any problems with this modem router yet, internet speeds have been reliably fast, and no issues with bad signals or bad connections.

$REVIEW.: First off I did extensive searching in a quest for a good gaming headset for the ps3.  The sharkoon is an excellent gaming headset with easy installation for the ps3.  The cord is long and thick, which is very good however it can tend to get a little heavy if you have to get up to move something.  Comfort level is very good on the ears but your ears will definitely get a little warm after a while. Sound quality is very good the mids and highs come through very clean.  The bass isnt the best in the world but Im also comparing it to my yamaha surround sound system also.  I purchased the set to give my son and wife a break from the "booms" of my call of duty games.  You cant go wrong with this heaset for the price and is a good alternative to any turtle beach or tritton headset.Update Jan. 2012.  Still no issues only minor thing is that sometimes it doesnt show me talking even though people can hear me. Also make sure you store it where the mic wont get compromised or stressed.

I have several pairs and all have been good quality. The sound quality is better than you would expect for this price. I always change to the smaller size and for me the fit is better and the low end (bass) is better. They do a good job at removing external sounds/noise. Not quite as good as earplugs but close. (I also wear earplugs regularly). The cord is long enough without being too long. The longest I've worn them is three hours and they were comfortable the entire time.

It provides both the ability to charge the devices as well as do data transfers.The cable is also a good length (or at least for my purpose).Its only failing is that it would have been extremely useful if it had a third connector to provide the same functionality for iPod type flat connectors

$REVIEW.: I think my review title says it all. Can't blame the reviewer who gave it one star because that is exactly how I felt when I opened the package. It is nothing but a very flimsy piece of plastic. However since I was going to push that piece of plastic hard and snug against a moving part on a $140 flash, I think it is good investment. The alternate option was to get the cheaper one which a number of people have complained about saying that it stuck too hard to the flash and damaged it.The Stofen attaches with just the right amount of pressure and comes off easily too. It greatly improves the quality of the pictures. So between getting a cheaper one that may damage my flash and holding up wax paper in front of the flash, I think this is a good option.

$REVIEW.: I collect headphones. Not intentionally, perhaps. But as my headphone box attests, I collect them. I head Sennheiser, Bose, Sony, JVC, Altec Lansing, Ultimate Ears, Grade, and many more. Some I like, some I hate. A few I gravitate toward repeatedly (like the Sennheiser HD600s for home listening, or the Bose QuietComfort IIs when flying, or the Ultimate Ears for the gym or mowing the yard).I can't really defend my collection. I am not sure I can even explain it, except to say that (with the possible exception of the Sennheisers) I'm always wondering if there's something better out there...Anyway, I got a pair of these Sennheiser PXC-310 phones to test. Now, I own a previous model in this series, the Sennheiser PXC-250. Those are small and quite comfortable, and the sound is very good. But the noise cancellation is so-so (owing the small earpads and on-ear design).By comparison, these PXC-310 phones have bigger earpads. They are still ON ear (not over the ear, like the Bose), but ON ear. The fact that they are bigger results in better noise cancelation than the PXC-250s. BUT, and this is a BIG but, the fact that they're bigger and they're ON ear means that with extended listening they start to bother me. It's not terrible, and for an hour or two, I'm fine. But eventually, I find that bigger muff on-ear design starts to give me a headache. I don't get that with the over-the-ear Bose (my go-to phones for airplane listening, meaning they stay on for hours), nor with, for example the Sennheiser HD600s (also over the ear).On the other hand, the sound quality of these headphones is better than the Bose: More neutral, and, in contrast to the pains induced by the physical construction, less fatiguing for anything approaching serious listening.The Bose also don't offer bluetooth connectivity. I found the bluetooth on these worked well. I own a previous pair of bluetooth headphones, the JBL Reference 610 phones. These work as well as those, and I like the sound of these better. I also like the aesthetics of these better. Until I obtained these, the JBLs were my headphones of choice for bluetooth listening. Now they're in "the box" and these Sennheisers are my choice when bluetooth is being used.If you're asking whether bluetooth is worthwhile...Don't think of it as a way to work at your computer or near your bluetooth enable ipod without a cord. Think of it as a way to walk around your house with a good sounding set of headphones talking to your PC or mp3 player in another room. Once you start using them this way, you'll love them...Overall, these are very good headphones. I am very happy with the sound, especially for so-called travel headphones: Neutral, and not fatiguing. Much better than heavily hyped (and expensive) competitors such as Bose. The active noise cancellation is good. It isn't as good as over the ear headphones, which combine active noise cancellation with the noise isolation that type of design offers. On the other hand, these look a lot less massive (and nerdy) than many headphones with that design. My main complaints would be that the on the ear design can be uncomfortable for very extended listening (although an hour or so is fine), and that the price is fairly high. But try them yourself. If they're comfortable for you, you can't go wrong with these.

$REVIEW.: Label (gray) reads: MaximalPower, 7.4V, 2000 mAh, Made in JapanOn my 60D it shows everything that it should:- correct battery type- remaining capacity- shutter count- recharge performanceAnd, you can even register the battery's serial number with the camera.The battery seems to die in a linear fashion as the OEM battery, and gives plenty of warning when it's run low.What it doesn't have is that little orange plastic tray, which is kind of a bummer, but I can probably survive.Since this is #2 next to an OEM battery, I'll report back if I find there's a noticeable shorter capacity or recharge performance, but so far it's performing as well as the OEM battery.If it peforms in the next few months as well as OEM, I'll up it to 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: Don't you love it when you purchase a new piece of gear and within minutes you wonder how you ever got along without it?I love this strap and use it for everything. My go to set up, a D800 with a grip and the hulky nikkor 80-200 attached to it, are completely safe and secure using my blackrapid. My longest continuous use of it was for 3 days straight for more than 8 hours a day and it performed great. Had I had my Nikon strap around my neck for that period of time I probably would need a chiropractor.Great gear and I will purchase one more for my other bag to ensure I am never without it. Highly recommended.Maybe a little pricey? That is why I only give it 4 stars. Design and function are superb. Although it is a great design, it is still a strap. 10 stars for functionality. I know, you get what you pay for. The connector/carabiner setup is excellent as well and really the heart of the strap and what separates it from others.
$SUMMARY.: Favorite piece of gear

$review_text.: I'll start off by saying, this is a great lens for the money.A few important things to note before purchasing lens:1. It's a fixed focal length. This means that you can't zoom in and out like with most lenses to get the composition you want. You have to move toward or away from your subject to compose the image.2. It doesn't have the AF-S motor built. It relies on the older "screw drive" motor for auto-focus. If you have a D5000, D5100, D5200, D3100, D3000, D60, D40, or D40x, you won't be able to auto focus with this lens. It still works great with manual focus. Even though you have to manually focus, the in-focus indictor  WILL work in your viewfinder, so you'll know you're in-focus at the chose AF points.3. It does not have image stabilization (VR) built in. On the lenses I have that have VR, I use it all the time. It has saved me from more than a few shaky shots. This one doesn't have it. Not a deal breaker.The good - it's a very fast, f/1.8 lens. The colors and contrast are fantastic.If you've got an FX camera, it's perfect for portraits. If you have a DX sensor (the less expensive, or entry-level Nikon DSLRs), the effective focal length is closer to 80mm, so you'll have to stand back further in order to get the whole subject in frame.The lack of the AF-S makes the autofocus a bit slower than with newer, more expensive AF-S lenses, but it's still not bad. I assume that it depends on the speed of the motor in your camera (see note 2 above) and honestly I have no idea if this speed varies from camera-to-camera. It's just noticeably slower than some of my other Nikkor glass.A couple of negatives...1. The construction feels more like a kit lens than I was hoping, it's very, very light and while it feels solid, it does not seem to have that same great fit that the other lenses in my bag have. It doesn't feel like it's going to come off, it's actually a bit snug when turning to lock it.2. The rear lens cap is a disappointing cheap plastic cover that looks more like discardable shipping material - no turn/lock, just slips on/off. I actually don't even know where it is anymore.3. Made in China. This was a lot more disappointing than anything else. Though I haven't found any flaws with it, and pretty much everything is made in China now... it's my first Nikkor lens that's made there. I think my reaction is more emotional than objective.(Edited 3/8/14 to clarify auto-focus piece)

$REVIEW.: Had WD fail and a Maxtor because of a poor design or something and or not good ventilation and they were not powered on all the time just for backups. Hope this one lasts but so far every external I looked into had problems. I have a passport also now that stopped working and then it did when plugged into another usb port which doesn't make sense because they are all USB3. Also a friend bought different ones from Costco and had 4 fail in a row in about a year. So I'm just crossing my fingers on this one and get a different second one to mirror just in case one crashes like most of them do. Also it makes no sense that it can only work with windows.Update today june 30 2014  So the Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 had only 6 hours of use for backup only then all of the sudden it was not recognized by windows explorer when it was before being plugged in an out before. Same with my other seagate drive which was a seagate free agent that started having the click of death (look that up if you don't know what it is) I made a mistake above saying the other was a Maxtor external...i have so many computers and drives and got them mixed up. So i opened up the cheap plastic case and hooked it up direct to the computer via USB and no clicking which means that it was the controller in the case and got all the data back. Now as far as the Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 that wasn't recognized i can't give it a proper rating yet because it didn't show up as a drive and I already had return labels ready to ship it back for a refund because in any partition program it showed up as a healthy drive but not as an NTFS file system and I thought how could that be since it was formatted that way and has all this data on it. Seagate help site was zero help like nothing at all. So I thought ok I'm going to have to run a recovery program to get the data back in RAW format since seagate had no answers for it at all. Then i tried something different after alot of people giving me stupid advice that didn't know anything saying update your usb drivers and the seagate drivers which is really stupid since the drive shows up as normal but not NTFS and I have been building and working with computers for over 20 years. So i opened up Disk Manager in windows and right clicked both seagate drives that worked before and assigned them other letters X and Y and viola it showed up in explorer and all the files are there even on the one that was clicking and the WD passport that wasn't showing up. Hope this helps someone that thinks their data might be lost but isn't and still there and not pay some company thousands to con you for data recovery which I have done myself for cheap on actual dead drives.So I have the return shipping label but think I will keep it for now but from all the negative reviews I'm going to get another probably a Hitachi which has a really good endurance rating. Also remember If it's just a back up drive then use it for backup and and shut it off after.

The new battery lasts between 2 and 3 hours with power-saving measures, which is pretty good for the small capacity battery.

I didn't realize that when I used Bluetooth I would no longer have sound on the IPad.  I'm still thrilled with this unit because the sound is excellent.  I know I will enjoy it for listening while I watch movies on my IPad.  I'm not crazy about wearing earphones and they're just about mandatory with Netflix movies since their sound level is very low.

$REVIEW.: This is my first Kodak camera. Have always been a Canon or Olympus fan for digicams.For traditional cameras, I have always been a Nikon user (N-80). I have never been a loyal Kodak camera user.This Kodak Z990 delivers more than what I expected at a very competitive price (I waited for months waiting for my sweet spot in terms of price). Like most, I spent months researching various options - the finalists were the Fuji S3000 or S4000, Panasonic FZ40 and Nikon L120. These 4 cameras were similar in price and features.Kodak Z990 offered the best price/performance and feature ratio - at a certain price level.If the price was any higher, I might have gone with the Panasonic FZ40.Positives:- Great fast zoom up to 30x optical and AF is pretty quick unlike the Fuji 2950/3200/4000 models.- Zoom is quiet (did not hear it in movie mode)- Videos are very high quality, not grainy/jumpy - my kids were quite surprised at the difference compared to older Canon SD750, SD1000 and Olympus FE series.- EVF is a big bonus, as it saves a lot on battery power- Color options are varied - vivid (Ektachrome), saturated (Kodachrome) or standard (Kodacolor)- I usually shoot with vivid.- B&W; options are very good too - corresponding to familiar shades (TMax, Tri-X, Sepia).- Full control options (Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority or Manual). I usually shoot with Aperture mode.- Wide aperture opening (f2.8 up to f8.0). The Fuji 2950/3300/4000 do not go as wide as 2.8.- BSI CMOS sensor is very good in low light.- Very good quality photos up to ISO 400 or 800. I usually shoot at ISO 200-400.- Relatively fast and responsive (non-continuous AF paired with Class 10 SDHC)- Dedicated video button - allows to take videos quickly- Option to take photos while taking videos (which often means 1920 x 1200 for me).- Video up to 1080p (the Nikon L120 goes up to 720p only)- The HDR mode is a great option (but many other models have this now).- After spending 3 weeks with the camera - I actually LIKE the UI navigation - simple / single level.- Uses regular AA batteries - unlike the Panasonic FZ40.Negatives:- Unable to use filters. Filters are very important as it protects the lense.- Camera errors when lens cap is not removed before unit is turned on.- Battery compartment cover unwieldy to close sometimes- Enclosed strap is low quality - not wide and thick (I guess they cut corners here)- The pre-charged batteries were practically dead when I initially used them. I guess this sat long in inventory. Not a big issue - had to wait overnight to charge them before initial use.- A little bit on the bulky side (due to the battery compartment). This was actually my biggest complaint because the Fuji and Nikon used the same 4 AA batteries but the overall size is smaller. But after 2 days, I have gotten used to the right handle grip.- Wish I could do manual zooming.- Wish it had metal with rubberized body- No miniature mode ... (still researching this).I hope this (camera's electronics) last long ... but it looks nicely built. I did buy a 3 year square trade warranty on this.I want to give it 4.5 stars ... due to the strap and user interface navigation ... but these were minor ... For the right price, it is 5 stars.

$review_text.: This is an excellent case
It's so nice and compact and fits in my cabinet really well

The dimensions on this site are wrong, that must be for the shipping box

I looked it up on another site to see what they actually are

It's only 13&#34; deep or so I think (can't remember now)

So yeah it's a tight fit all around

But I like that.I took out all the case fans except one
With one fan I have more room, it blows out all the warm air, is quieter, and leaves openings that will allow good airflow
Works perfect, no heat problems at all (and I'm using this for a gaming rig with good parts that put out heat)


I also removed the fan filter so I don't ever have to take out the fan to clean it.One problem I had though was that sure my video card fit just enough


Great it's snug perfect! BUT mine has power cords going to the SIDE of my card, which is the top of the case, I had to really bend them down hard to get the top on


And now there is a small hump on the top

I'll have to buy some angled power cords for it or something


They really should have added just about a half inch more, since it's an average size decent card and there are quite a few that are side powered.One last thing, the entire front panel is PLASTIC
That irritated me


But it does look nice at least
Everything is still very solid and built well

Shoot for a $100 I'm pretty happy though
It's a great price and great box, I buy it again at this price is I needed another one.

$REVIEW.: Before purchasing this strap I read several reviews on many different brands. One of the common complaints was the strap did not work well when mounting the camera on a tripod with the strap in place. I use a Nikon D5200 with a Sigma 70-300 lens and have not had any problems. I have uploaded a couple of photos showing this combination mounted on Vanguard SBH-250 ballhead. I have not had any problems with the strap coming loose with the quick-release plate attached. In any instance when I do need to mount a tripod or monopod with the strap removed, I have had no trouble just allowing the strap to dangle from the side.

The cable management is also easy with this unit.On a side note though, I don't know if Amazon sent me a used case or not but box was not sealed when it arrived

The rear bottom of the case was so bent it was almost impossible to install my Power Supply without hammering ti out first

Due to it being bent, every time I open and close the case the medal flanges would get hooked onto each other and get stuck.

Love the media controls and all its other features.The only thing I don't like about the keyboard is that the "wrist-rest" is pretty much useless. Wrist-rests are supposed to be ergonomic by nature and this keyboard's wrist rest is far from being ergonomic. Of course, it's not marketed as an ergonomic keyboard, it's marketed as a gaming keyboard and does an excellent job in that aspect.All in all, it's a wonderful keyboard and I'm glad I got it.

$REVIEW.: I have been using this iClever Bluetooth keyboard with both my desktop PC and my Android tablet for a few weeks.  So far, so good.  I like it a lot.Pairing is quick and easy.  Once paired, it connects as soon as I turn the keyboard on.  After a period of non-use, it goes to sleep, but it will quickly reconnect again when I wake it up.  Responsiveness is very good, just like my wireless Logitech keyboard.I like the feel of the keyboard.  It&#8217;s comfortable to type on.  I can do it by touch and feel.  It&#8217;s about the size of the keyboard on my netbook, which I think is a good size for a small keyboard.I'd say it's missing a stand for the tablet and a cover for the keyboard, both of which are included with another Bluetooth keyboard I own.  It also doesn't fold up like a third Bluetooth keyboard I own.  I like typing on it, though, which is where it earns its five stars.This product was provided for review by Hisgadget.

AUDIO Tape is a better medium for live recodings as the digital recorders I have used ALL DISTORT on loud passages.  This recorder has AGC (auto level recording) which is great for voice recording of classes etc or for recording family history (interview your parents) etc.  Be sure to use a decent grade audio tape with this.  I recomment the Fugi 90 minute normal bias tapes.  Maxell tape has more noise and is prone to defects. Also use fresh (Alkaline) batteries and change them after every two or three tapes.  And use a Q tip and alcohol to clean the heads after 10 tapes.  This will insure good quality recordings.  One a tape recording has been made you can transfer this onto CD if desired.

I needed the extra length due to the way my room is set up, and for under $5, I figured that if it didn't work, then no big loss
I ordered the cable on a Sunday, it shipped out Monday, and I got it Thursday


I'm sure where you live plays part in the shipping times, But I thought it was pretty quick
I tried the cable on my laptop, and my Blu Ray player

Worked perfect on both


The picture was perfectly clear, and so was the sound


Like a lot of people have mentioned, it's a digital connection


As long as there are no breaks in the cable and the signal gets through, then it's going to work

The cable I ordered was just as described
It does ship in a clear plastic bag inside a shipping bag, but when it involves free shipping, I didn't care as long as it wasn't damaged

$review_text.: This is a better than average TV in this rather scarce size class (I didn't buy it for the DVD player). However, viewing angles from above & below the level line of site are really bad (maybe limited to +47 degrees & -47 degrees). Horizontal viewing angles on my set were very good (perhaps 80 degrees left and 80 degrees right). So mine is not really usable at upper book shelf or top of refrigerator elevations, if viewers are in a seated position. Picture color and sharpness are both very good, contrast in low-light scenes leaves something to be desired, and sound is excellent for given speaker size. I would probably buy it again, but not for the same planned usage that I had for this one. As usual, Amazon.com shipping was prompt and without any damage.

$review_text.: I expected a lot more from this device.I expected it to at least perform as well as the older 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter TL-WN722N I was using in my Windows PC. In the past wireless PCI devices have always been faster and more reliable than any usb wireless device I have used. That is not the case with this device.It may be the software to blame since it didn't give me a first good impression. First of all, in Windows 7 64 bit it said it would only install the driver and not the rest of the software, and even after I installed it would randomly connect. The signal was also weaker than with the 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter TL-WN722N, which was hard to believe since this device has 3 antenna's instead of just 1 like my old device! Anyways, so I tried using it in Windows 8 to see if that fared any better but no it was worse! First off make sure you don't use the driver included on the CD unless you want a BSOD and have to try to recover the OS! Make sure you do a manual install of the drivers only in Windows 8 if you want to try it out. Officially there is no Windows 8 support for this device. Not that it matters much because even after I finally got it to work without crashing my computer the signal and performance wasn't any better than with Windows 7. I'm talking about 1/2 the speed I was getting with my older device so if I"m lucky I'll get 1/2 meg of bandwdith with 2 bars whereas with my old usb stick I consistently get 3 bars and up to 3.5MB/sec from my wireless router which is located about 100 feet away.Hopefully, there will be an official Windows 8 driver release which will not only work properly but fix the performance issues, until then I've gone back to my older and more reliable usb wireless device. Or maybe I just got a bum card since most other reviews of this card seem to be pretty positive?

$REVIEW.: I love this GPS watch.  I carried an uPro pocket GPS long before Callaway bought the company, and I successfully used it with the aid of my laser for over 5 years.  I was notified by Callaway that they were dropping the product line with no support and close the website in a few months... so I decided to make a switch.  I've been reading up on these GPS watches and realized it may fit my bill.  When on a course the most important data is distance, to the pin, or to carry or lie a hazard... This watch does it perfectly.  No reaching into my pocket or bag to read a screen to give me the same info a GLANCE at my wrist can do.  I haven't felt the need to confirm anything with my laser (You'll find it on eBay in a few days).  I've played 8 full rounds so far, you get 2 1/2 rounds per charge.  It also has the ability to measure a single shot at a time... Ever wonder just how long that drive was, or that second shot with your 3 hybrid when you know you caught it just right, and yea, you can do the basic deduct math in your head... But why not just stay focused on your game?  The silicone band is extremely soft and comfortable and fits my 8 1/2" wrist with 4 band settings to spare.  Just turn it on play golf 7 minutes before you tee off and everything else is done for you (auto hole advance).  I love this GPS watch!!

My existing stereo system has two large BIC speakers for the normal Left-Right service connected to to a Yamaha 5.1 receiver.

 Everything else does exactly as it says it does.OK, here is a comment of 0.1% of people out there, the amp in this - while adequate - has trouble producing midrange and there is the slightest interference from the transformer


 You will have to really be an audiophile to notice any of this - and then probably only with fairly high end speakers

$review_text.: This is my second RavPower product and I am quite impressed with the quality and performance of their items. The first item I got from them was a 5500mAH powerbank (a portable battery to charge phones/ipod etc) which is still going strong.This battery (HP12B-RB, 12 Cells, 10.8v) was used and tested in a HP DV4-2145dx laptop. The original battery for this laptop wasn't holding a charge, pretty much dead. I got the 12-Cell battery which is quite larger then the 6 cell, but also lasts longer which is great for me for those long flights.  The 12-Cell battery raises the back of the laptop off the surface which has the added benefit for increased air flow and tilting the keyboard up.  I like the keyboard being tilted up on the laptop and pretty much prefer it that way now.  The angle is similar to a desktop keyboard with the clips put down. It is in the middle price range for replacement batteries but looks to be a quality product. The packaging is attractive and the battery came in a electrostatic bag.Below is a timetable just to give an indication of how long the battery lasted and an indication of how long it took to charge.  The laptop was being used in full performance/operation when these times were taken, if the laptop was off the battery no doubt would have charged faster. Note: the instructions state that it will take 5 full charging cycles (charge/drain) before reaching full capacity, my test was done after 1 charge cycle.6:10  full charge6:38  84% charged6:49  77% charged7:05  69% charged7:56  46% charged8:32  32% charged8:43  29% charged9:15  8% charged, system goes into hibernation mode9:36  15% recharged9:46  20% recharged10:20 35% recharged10:42 46% rechargedAfter the first use the battery lasted roughly 3 hours.  Once the battery has reached full capacity I expect the battery to last even longer.Specifications:Model: HP12B-RBCondition: Brand NewCell Type: Samsung Li-ion 12-CellVoltage: 10.8vCapacity: 8800 mAH 95wWeight: 3 pounds12-Month manufacture warranty.One quirk: Make sure when you put the battery in that it clicks into place or else when you move your laptop the battery may loose contact and your machine will shutdown if you don't have the AC adapter plugged in.  This happened to me twice until I figured out that the battery needs to click in place.  It was somewhat difficult to get the battery to click in place but it does.But overall this is a great product, and I would highly recommend it.I was provided a free sample by the distributor for testing and evaluation to write a fair and honest review.Note: Read the instructions prior to use. The instructions state to charge overnight before first using.  The battery I received was 42% charged.RavPower Webpage with information on compatible part numbers and laptops, which is really a lot.[...]I was provided a free sample by the distributor for testing and evaluation to write a fair and honest review.

$REVIEW.: I received mine today. So far, I love it! I will be using it mostly as an e-reader, and I was concerned about that. I actually like it much better than my Touch as an e-reader. My two favorite things are the page turns (you can turn a page slowly) and the select a word feature. You get the definition and more options. Of those, the option I love (the Touch didn't have it) is to search the book for other instances of the word. If I don't remember who a character is, I just touch and hold their name, choose options, and search. Up come the instances of that word, with a short part of the context following. This can even be expanded. On the Touch, you get the definition, but nothing else.I don't think reading will give me eye strain.As far as the web surfing, it seems that the connection is actually faster than my computer.Of course, the screen look is fabulous and the touch sensitivity is just right (better than my Touch).The only nit-picking I can think of is: it's heavier than my Touch,it has to be charged more often, you can't put books into collections, and it is a little difficult to find the on/off button. I'm getting a Mo-Ko cover, so I hope that will make it more convenient.I'm glad I bought this instead of the Paperwhite.I'll try to watch this for a couple of days in case there are questions I can hopefully answer.

I've had no problems at all.All my MP3s & WMAs are ripped from CD or "borrowed" from back in the old napster days, so I really had no problems dealing with DRM.  For the past year or so, I've been using Yahoo Unlimited to stream on-demand music, so I had no reason to buy the tracks... thus no complaints about compatibility there either.On to the Zune software.  No real complaints there.  I enjoy the Zune Pass.  I will probably pay for it once my trial is up.  I would like to see some kind of "radio" or genre jukebox feature in the future.I love that there are already hacks for the Zune.

Tried again with another one, a generic non-Toshiba brand, and it was the same.Third time's a charm on this one--it  works beautifully. The brick is small so it makes it easier to manage when you have a computer in which the battery has died and you have to have the charger in it (if the charger plug comes out the computer shuts off completely with no battery reserve). This adapter works great and doesn't get super hot. I like the blue lighting on it too. For the price, I'm quite impressed with the non-branded adapter and if I needed one, would definitely buy this one again.

I dont like the thought of someone stealing my expensive radios, so this one will have to do.The stock microphone SUCKS, its doesnt fit the hand well, and feels of cheap plastic. Try out the SRA 158 by ranger, good price, good reviews.There is next to nothing fancy about this radio. Just a bare bones cb radio with PA capability. Modifications for this radio are pretty slim. If you play with it a little you can get it to perform. if you know what I mean.The best thing you can do if you skimped on the radio is get quality components for everything else. Coax cable, antenna, those are the real keys to cb success. Dont forget to tune your antenna.Once you get a good set up the radio is good to go as a basic cb that will get you through.

 Everything else is identical
 It sells for $250, which is less than the Flyer, but you need to have a data plan through Sprint

$REVIEW.: This isn't a horrible amp, but I think there are better options. I used it to power two horn loaded subwoofers.The first issue I noticed is that the auto on/off is useless for subwoofer duty. Even with the line level turned up on my AVR, it would incessantly switch on and off. The auto on/off feature can be bypassed by using input 2 and setting the "AUTO ON" switch to Normal, but it would be nice if there were a sensitivity adjustment of the input volume or if AudioSource would at least increase the timeout period before it shuts off from not receiving a signal.The second issue is that it made a very loud low frequency pop each time it was turned off via the switch (since the auto on/off doesn't work). It might be less noticeable when used for main or surround speakers, but it sounded horrible on a subwoofer and made the amp seem cheap.Besides the issues I mentioned, it worked fine and the sound quality was adequate (when it would stay on long enough to hear it).I ended up disconnecting it because it wasn't working out and decided to use an older stereo receiver that can be turned on/off with my Harmony remote.

On my i7-3770k rig, from the time I press the power button, its about 13 seconds until I am using the computer.  Very fast boot times!Plus having BF3 and all map-packs on it is really great.  Maps load instantaneously.  Can't say enough good things about this drive.So what are you waiting for?  Get one now.The only thing I would say is to try and do a fresh install of the OS if you can, rather than trying to migrate or clone it.  The Samsung Magician utility software is cool, but a fresh install is much better and more stable.

$REVIEW.: This is my first Hybrid HD. I already use one SSD HD for my Windows install and another one for my main gaming disk so I am familiar with the speeds it delivers at the expense of storage space. So it seems that an Hybrid option would be ideal to get higher transfer speeds while being able to store large amounts of data..If I am correct, the hybrid is a normal Hard drive coupled with an fairly large SSD interface.Does it deliver? I would definitely say so.I have just installed it a little more than one hour ago and I after formatting it with two partitions, I have started copying about 385 GB of data onto it. It has taken roughly one hour do finish it. It is extremely silent. My case is currently opened and I do not hear any disc noise whatsoever.My file manager reported the following speeds:- Max: 186 MB/s- Average: 146 MB/sMy previous Seagate 4TB HD was giving me some average speeds of 104MB/s when I tested it.Interestingly, I did not get nowhere as good results when writing onto my second partition on this disk.Here are the speeds I obtained with the same file manager:- Max: 131 MB/s- Average: 95 MB/sI also had twice the bad experience to lose the drive completely while transferring files onto it. Windows did recognize it again after rebooting. The issue has not occurred since but it worries me. I will increase my rating if it does perform well after at least one week but for the moment, the slow speed on the second partition and the sudden stops are not warranting more than two stars.Edit 12/10/13.As of now, the drive has not failed me again. However, when I did run it with HD Tune to check its speeds, it came out as being slower as the non hybrid drive from the same manufacturer (same 4TB size). Because the speeds are still acceptable and because it did not fail, I will increase it to 3 stars.

 I researched for two days & nights before making the purchase, I'm a little anal that way

 It is definitely as described & pretty darn simple to operate
External lighting is needed for more distance

I have two other Full Spectrum cameras & I may sell those & purchase another one of these
 The Cleveland Paranormal site is now in my Favorites list

 Again, bravo!!!  Oh, one more thing


 I received the camera 5 days before the estimated delivery date
 Thanks again!


$SUMMARY.: Excellent camera, bravo!!!

$REVIEW.: I'll give this five stars because it's an ambitious effort for under $600.00However, read all the reviews carefully for the cons; there are many and none noted seem unfair. Just take them into account before jumping into anything.If you do not have prior networking experience, and/or hard wire experience, do NOT buy this as it can eat you up. In my area, installation was offered for $250.00. If you can get that deal, go for it. Otherwise, be prepared to work, perhaps hard, to get this to do what you want it to do.If you do have prior networking and hardwire experience, keep in mind that this system, used fully, opens up your PC to all sorts of evils in order for it to work remotely. You may want to set up different profiles/users to get around some of this. And, if you have done lots of hardwiring, this system has you making some pretty big holes in things and leaves you wondering what to do with the excess cable, wondering how well the soft cable will hold up under stress and time, and so forth. My use for this system is short-term and I have a spare laptop to dedicate to this, so I'm OK with lots of the downsides just mentioned.Out of the box, this deal is simple enough. I was disappointed, to the point I quit asking, with tech support. I had no problems (after reading and heeding all the reviews) installing the system. But, fine-tuning it and getting more out of it without their input was just wishful thinking. It worked well enough for what I wanted to do, but it is by no means a "heavy duty" system or a "one size fits all" solution.First off, you have an effective range of 15 to 20 feet. It's handy for seeing that "something" is going on. But, it's not really a good ID system to prove "who" was doing something.Second, four cameras is probably not enough for any real security. Again, handy for some things - like, "Is somebody in the driveway?". But, once you start thinking about it, there are many areas around home or work that you might want to keep an eye on. And, anyone who wants to sneak up on you can check out the camera layout easy enough and find a way to get to you without being seen.Third, reviewing and off-loading video is slow, clumsy, and, akin to video editing. It has fast-forward features, etc. But, rewind is slow and viewing/copying is in real time. In fact, for practical purpose, everything happens in real time. Unless you know when something happened, you'll be at this a long time. And, if you have it on FF3, you may miss the tiny bit of activity that happened entirely.Fourth, it would be nice if it could be set to record ONLY motion. From what I can figure, when it detects motion it records at the frame rate you set... Meaning, in real time it can do x frames per second, but when motion is detected it begins recording at x times 4 frames per second so you can see more detail. If your actor is moving quickly, you may get nothing at all, or, nothing at all useful.I'll stop there. It's a good "nanny cam," and it can be handy for watching day-to-day real time comings and goings. Do not, however, bet the farm on this thing. It's just not solid enough to count on it for a lot.Still, for under $600.00 AND providing some remote access ability, you can't knock it on the very basics that it CAN deliver.

$review_text.: It's a little tight, and I'd like a little more room in the pockets for my battery charger, spare batteries and spare memory cards, but by being a little creative, I can get my Canon HS40 camera into it by putting it in sideways, I can get two spare batteries in the pocket on the top, a couple spare memory cards in their cases and the little pouch to hold the battery terminal protector in a pocket on one side, the charger in the side pocket on the other side and my microfiber lens cleaning cloth in it's cover and the USB cable to download my pics in a flap behind the camera. It's a snug fit, but it's well padded, compact, and does hold everything. It would be nice to have a little bigger pockets so I could eventually add additional filters for my lens, but it seems to be very well made and keeps my equipment from getting banged up by flopping around in it. I would definitely buy it again if I needed to, although if a similar case were to become available with an additional pocket or two, or slightly larger side pockets for a reasonably comparable price, I'd probably go for that instead. It would be great for the little square, flat cameras that don't look like the old 35mm film cameras.

$review_text.: I'm a bit of an audiophile and likely would be crucified for saying I use an FM transmitter in my car, but it was my best option at the time.  I've had multiple FM transmitters and there are always issues with excess static and weak signals, regardless of the station I'd be on.  The GOgroove is easy to use, sounds very good (for what it is), and the ability to charge your phone while in use is great.The one con I would say (and a fairly major one) is that while the phone is being charged, it would emit a loud sound in the speakers while trying to play.  I typically use the charging and FM transmitter separately as a result, which is not a big inconvenience for me, but may be for others.

$REVIEW.: Initially, I wasn't sure about the flip cover design of this Kindle cover.  I was looking at the more traditional side opening, "book" style covers.  After using this for a week or so, I'm really glad I chose this design.  The top can be secured with the elastic band and it does not create a bulky bend on the side - it's at the top and out of the way.  As other reviewers have said, you really can't stand up the Kindle while in this cover, but you can tuck your fingers in it and hold it without squeezing or gripping it.  The leather seems of good quality.  My only concern is how long will the elastic band hold up.  It is made of elastic embedded fabric and feels like it will stretch out with continued use.  This hasn't happened yet, but I've only been using it for a week.  I would recommend this cover, but understand that I can't be certain how durable the band will be.

You couldn't possibly have smooth motion for video work
Might be fine for photos only

Additionally, loosening the control rods just a little, required to release the tension, makes them very wobbly, adding to the jerky motion required to overcome the stiffness of the mechanism.

$review_text.: We used this screen with a computer projector in a trade show booth. Please note a couple of things:1) I didn't think I had the right frame at first as the two set of poles did not match up.  Fear not - gently pull the ends together - the slight tension keeps the frame very taught which is necessary to stretch the screen.  The wrinkles disappear when it's tight.2) The screen is slightly off white (very light cream).  Over the long run this is probably OK as it will hide the inevitable dirt and marks better.3) The screen is widescreen format so if your projector does not support this you will have extra &#34;unused&#34; screen on the sides.4) The actual white portion of the screen is 45&#34; x 79&#34;.  Overall the dimensions are 59&#34; x 93&#34; (just under 5' x 8') - perfect for a 10' booth.5) And it all fits into a bag that is 19.5 x 4.5 x 6.5 inches ... fits in a suitcase! (they say it weighs 5 lbs - I didn't check but that is about right)

$REVIEW.: I bought this connector to replace the broken one on my HP G60-530.  The connector itself is well made and fit perfectly however the wires are about 2cm longer than the original making it very difficult to find space for the extra cable in the cramped laptop case.  To make matters worse the wires themselves are a heavier gauge which adds to their bulk and also makes them harder to bend and get out of the way of the speaker mount.  I did manage to get the cram the connector into the case and get the screws in place but it was a *very* tight fit.

$REVIEW.: Our SONY KDF series lamp died.  Not being familiar with the technology, I was ready to call a repair person or replace the unit.  On a hunch, I did a google search which led to a blog, which led to a youtube video.I decided to buy a lamp and try fixing the unit myself (OK, it isn't much of a fix, replacing a light bulb). I looked at prices, what all was included with the lamp (some units do not include the housing, you must reuse the old one), and feed back.  The Pureglare offering was reasonably priced when calculating in shipping and handling.The unit arrived the next day (one night without TV).  I followed the youtube tutorial and within 5 minutes I was back in business.  I was ecstatic. I couldn't have scheduled a repairman for what I paid to complete the repair.Replacing the lamp is incredibly easy, and the fix was incredibly reasonably priced compared to the cost of replacing the whole unit.  I bought a duplicate of the lamp on the outside chance the set lasts another 8 years.

I have them running near a 4 gauge power cable and get no feedback at all
Most of the install the power and audio are separate for most of the run but at the end for about a foot or two the power and audio overlap


I was worried about feed back but have not had any problems with that


These cables are also long enough to run from the front of a toyota 4 runner to the back with extra cable to move speaker and amp around
I would highly recommend these wires to anyone very happy with product.

This is my 2nd Roku device, use them both on 2 different non-internet TV's.  And ROKU is the only one so far w/ Amazon Prime streaming video.  Chromestick?  Nope.  The WiFi receiver on this seems really good, I've never had a dropped signal even tho its clear across the house from my router.  Zero complaints.  Small size, fits out of sight behind the TV and powers from the TV USB port, so no extra cords needed.  It can be plugged into a wall outlet if your TV doesn't have a powered USB port.

 I really don't need a dvd player in my kitchen, but given the price of this unit, I felt that the convenience was worth it.Basically - don't expect much
It's a lightweight unit with mediocre playback quality and functionality


And I think that's fair, given the budget pricing


 If what you want is a basic functional player - as a backup or for a rarely-used location, then this model will do just fine


 I've probably used this about a dozen times, with no problems


 If I had been planning on racking up hundreds of hours on it, I would have bought a better model.For casual use in a non-primary setting, this is fine


 That's pretty much what my review is:  This is ok

$REVIEW.: I am reviewing the AKG K242 along with the FiiOE6.I plugged-in this power hungry 91 db AKG unit to my ipod's headphone jack  and as expected from the AKG's specs and the notoriously bad equalization of the Apple Touch Ipod, sound produced was very restrained.  A number of users warned of this so I ordered my AKG with an inexpensive EiiO6 headphone amp.The K242 delivered 300% better at line level boosted by EiiO E6 portable headphone amp.  With this low cost combination, program material was freed IPod's wimpy built in equalizer.  The AKG K242's great potential has been tapped for portable use!!I also own a Grado SR80i which is more efficient at 99 db and am happy to report that it also greatly benefits from the amp.The AKG plays loud enough out of Sony Walkman MP3 and the sound quality is good straight from device.  However, I bet it will sound better at line level + FiiO6 + L5 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For Sony Walkman.  I can't wait for my order (I am getting another EiiOE6 for it)Some may complain about the AKG K242's  10 foot chord but a belt clip GPS case solved the mobility issue.  I walked 5 miles yesterday with the entire package - AKG, EiiO6, L9 LOD in the GPS case and it was bliss!!The EiiO6 manufacturer's claim of 10 hours use per charge is true for this brand new unit.  It took approx 45min-1 hour to charge from a USB port.  I wonder how long the lithium battery will last ... anyway I am endorsing this model because of its performance and low replacement cost.

It's very, very easy to use

Unpack the unit, which is a black box with a USB mini port, activity light, and no other connections or buttons to worry about
Plug it in to the computer with the provided 14-inch USB cable
Windows recognized it straight away and it's good to go.The drive manual and optional software is preloaded on the drive itself

You can load their specialized drivers and formatters if you like
I didn't bother
The drive comes preformatted in FAT32 format which is most compatible with different OS'es

$REVIEW.: Other reviewers have waxed enthusiastic about the sound. To be sure these do sound great for what they are, but I want to level set expectations: if you tend to be a critical listener these may fall short. If you have to be surrounded by music most of your waking hours for pleasure you will love these.What earned the review sample that I received a solid five stars is they are ultra comfortable and they stay in place when I am on my daily walks and short jogs. There is a safty factor too: they do not totally block ambient noise, so I can hear approaching cars behind me when I am on a walk. The isolating in-ear monitors that I normally use so completely blocked out everything that I was in my own world on walks and drifted into a few unsafe situations.The sound quality is such that you can easily hear high, mid and low range frequencies in most music. I listen to acoustic jazz circa 1950s and these do an excellent job for that style.An interesting observation is during my testing I paired and connected with these, put them through their paces and then paired and connected to another bluetooth device that I was checking out. These remained connected after I established a connection to the other device and I was able to stream music to both simultaneously. That leads me to conclude that two people could listen to the same music stream if each had a pair of these phones. That impressed me.Bottom line: these phones are everything the previous reviewers said and are perfect for sports or other active endeavors because they do stay put. Plus they easily fit in a shirt pocket.

$REVIEW.: Bought this to use with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR camera and can definitely say that it performs without any glitch right out of the box, taking into consideration, I formatted it using the camera features to do so.Definitely a bargain purchase especially for those devices that require a high class flash memory as per its performance features.

$review_text.: I am updating my original review entered on December 2. The original review is attached to this update.I contacted COWON for an RMA, which was provided within less than a day. I sent my unit back on December 3 and received the repaired unit on December 12.The customer service, both on the telephone and online was excellent.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:I ordered my G3 2GB last July, 2005. Now the beginning of December it will not power up at all. It showed only minor signs of problems; signs I recognized only after it died completely.I tried reloading the firmware and all the troubleshooting pointers that the Cowon site and the phone techsupport folks walked me through. Still, nothing. The play/pause button has lost it's "click" feeling indicating that it may be an actual hardware, switch problem.It is within the product warranty. I have requested an RMA from COWON.If you are considering this product, I would suggest being conservative and invest in only the 1GB version, not the 2GB. And probably purchase the additional warranty. The warranty recommendation comes from a person who NEVER considers such warranties, knowing that they are generally money-makers for the manufacturers. However, after researching this problem and chatting on the Cowon forums with other customers with problems, I would purchase the warranty, as the product is not inexpensive.I will add more after my entire replacement/repair ordeal is finished. Wish me luck! It was, after all, five stars only yesterday.
$SUMMARY.: My review is back up to 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: I bought mine at Frys for $19.00 a couple weeks ago. (wow!) (or rather, holy cow!)I do not respect most things Apple, like Bonjour especially, but this simple thing works and works well enough that I can avoid buying a several hundred dollar NAS.Took about 15 min to get it fully functional with 3 computers, guess Bonjour has to get friendly with all the pieces in the puzzle. And without a drive attached it won't register at all. So I have a 4GB thumb drive "on" it all the time...and you wouldn't believe how handy that really is! A 1TB USB NTSF formatted drive is also plugged in, but I keep it powered off until I need it. Saves bearing wear, I imagine. Takes a little while to register after bringing it up. But I think of the $200 I'm saving...&lt;G>I use muCommander as my main file manager (on both my mac mini and Win XP) and it has no problem logging onto the SimpleNet and whatever is plugged in and turned on.I do not know how durable (as in using a drive attached to...) it is for a full image backup to it as a NAS, but the drive is a std USB and can be replugged wherever. As opposed to most NAS devices that require the drive, even USB external drives plugged into the NAS, to be formatted for Linux so you cant use it for Win or Mac directly. Media streamers might not like it. But I am document oriented and love it.Realizing what is isn't, I give it 5 stars for what it is...a cheap, effective way to directly plop a drive on your network.

$review_text.: So, I was excited to get the cleaner, and it works okay, but after a while, I noticed a few things compared to the microfiber cloths we have.The Pros:+ It's a handy little cleaner+ Easier to carry around than a larger cleaning clothThe Cons:- It's not as easy to clean as a cleaning cloth. The instructions say just wipe/brush it off, but you can't wash it, and that's a lot of germs a oils that get transfered to it without a good cleaning. In that sense, it should be anti-microbial.- You have to be careful to not let the plastic backing hit against your device (iPad, etc). If you bring it to clean the surface at an angle instead of flat, you can hit the plastic corners against your device's screen which isn't good.- It doesn't clean as well as just a microfiber cloth. It seems to smudge the oils around whereas a cloth, you can fold over to a new side to clean better, and then wash the cloth itself.- Would be better if it came with a little case to cover the cleaning side. If you toss it in your laptop bag, or set it down cleaning side down, it'll pick up the dust or particles.So, it's a nice little product, but really, a microfiber cleaning cloth works just as well, if not better because you can clean a microfiber cloth much easier.
$review_summary.: Nice idea, but a microfiber cloth is better

$REVIEW.: Yes, I know this was designed for the Thrive series, but as it was cheap, and the dock connection is (at least physically) the same I figured I'd try this thing, and the required power supply, to use with my Excite 10 tablet.  Thankfully it was only about ten bucks combined as they didn't work to power my tablet or pass through audio.  Which is not to say it should have.  So - experiment mostly failed.However, if you want a stationary stand for your tablet, and don't care if you can't simultaneously charge it, this works grand, and is about as cheap as a tablet stand gets :)  It's a good viewing angle for desk tops and very stable.I'd have given it 5 stars if the vertical support folded down to make it more compact and portable.

$review_text.: Straight out of the box, I love it.  I ordered my Lenovo laptop (4330AU) over Thanksgiving weekend.  Paid $376 for it with free shipping.  Received in 3 business days.  I purposely did not want the latest and greatest computer, and looked for solid customer reviews before purchasing.  This is my 3rd laptop and, so far, after only using for one day, I like this one best.  For the money, I'm pleased.  Some of the little things I liked immediately included:  a 10-key pad; a textured surface that doesn't show finger prints (finally!); easy to setup with no added crap; fast; quick to connect to my home wi-fi; very nice screen (although seems just a tad bit smaller than stated size).  This laptop doesn't get hot like my old one, and the battery life appears to be as stated (4 hours) while running several websites and the wireless card.I plan to use this laptop mostly for internet, Microsoft Office, photo editing, PC games, etc.  Nothing serious.  If this laptop holds up even 1 year for me, it will be my best purchase ever!Updated 12/28/12I have had two cases where, after a long period of time idle, the screen blinks when a key is pressed. Makes it impossible to shut it down using the mouse, so I use task manager and keyboard commands.  After rebooting, the problem goes away.  Never experienced this type of issue before, and not sure if it's serious.  I plan to look into more over the weekend.  Other than that, still very happy with this laptop.

$REVIEW.: This is a fantastic, multi-featured receiever with a few shortcomings


You have to buy a wifi dongle and a BT dongle if you'd like to use Bluetooth or Wifi, This will add almost $200 to the price of your unit.We have a 46 inch LED TV that was just straining like the little engine trying to push should from the Blu Ray player and an entire set of Polk Speakers in a sad pile under the couch

Waiting

Finally this unit came up as a deal on Woot and I went for it.Setup was a piece of cake, Maintaining the connections would be so much easier if I'd used zip ties and color coordinated tape
I suggest you take a lesson from my frustration if you have several components


I'm running an Xbox 360, sub, BR Player and laser disc player though this thing, along with appropriate Digital audio cords and an Ethernet cable

it's messy back there.For the most part the sound is amazing and I've had no problems


I used the learning feature on the remote to streamline my stuff quite a bit


Super easy.I bought and returned the Bluetooh adapter


the range was way too short to be useful.My biggest hang up with this unit right now is that it suddenly stopped playing iPhones through the USB


It plays my iPad's media just fine

The display, when plugged into an iPhone, will match the iphone's content

However no sound will stream through the speakers
I've not yet found any support solutions online, but hopefully this will get worked out soon since I work on the iPad and usually have the phone sitting idle


I just bought a powerline adapter and connected the Pioneeer through it, so hopefully I will be able now to use iton the network.All in all, great reciever and I think the iPhone issue must be related to latest updates, since the iPad will connect  perfectly.

$REVIEW.: I have had this home theater system for a couple of months now and am very pleased with it
I am using different speakers for front channel though
I did get one that had a dead rear left surround channel out of the box


I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement ASAP
However they did have to send the whole package instead of just the receiver, so I just swapped receivers when the replacement arrived.I had researched all current models of receivers prior to purchasing this one


I came to the conclusion that all home theater blu ray combos where out of the question if I wanted anything that sounds good
So, I looked at getting a receiver and speakers


Then I came to the conclusion that good sound was expensive

Then I found this Onkyo HTIB


It solves all the issues of someone that needs great sound on a limited budget


The auto config with the mic is awesome and works better then expected
The hdmi passthrough is handy when you want to watch something without using the receiver

Menus and interface is kinda plain, but works well
Ipod integration works well and shows all the music on the tv.I would recommend to anyone


If you get one that is dead out of the box, the amazon return is an easy process to do

The only reason this receiver did not get 5 stars is due to the the fist one being DOA.

$REVIEW.: I picked this up after playing with it at the airport - a guy next to me was using one.  Turns out he works for Microsoft and had a bag full of mice with him, and this is the one he pulled out of his bag to work with.I really liked the "cool factor" of the Arc Touch.  I like snapping it into an arc to turn it on and work, and snapping it flat to turn it off, and the thing looks sleak.  The receiver is small enough that I never take it out of the laptop, so I don't worry about it coming loose of its normal magnetic mooring on the bottom of the mouse.Other reviewers have commented that the buttons were hard to press, but I think they're trying to press at the base of the button, not the end where one's hand naturally falls.  The mouse glides over the surface easily, and I find it comfortable in my hand.My real problem is with the touch bar.  I cannot get it to scroll smoothly.  I've tried every setting, every speed, and every possible technique and gesture on the bar, and no matter what, the scrolling is more of a jerky "clunk, clunk, clunk" than a smooth scroll.  The touch is a little uncertian.  Flicking works OK, but has the same jerky effect.  My old Microsoft wireless mouse with the scroll wheel scrolls smoothly and easily.I'm not bothered with the lack of back buttons, etc, that other people have complained about.  I don't use them and find their presence annoying and usually shut them off.All in all, the Arc Touch is a little disappointing.  I'll probably schlepp it around for a couple more weeks just to show it off, but I'm thinking it gets relegated to the drawer at home where old toys go to die.  We'll see.  I may discover how to fix the scroll issues, and if I do, I'll like the Arc Touch a LOT better.  I will then post an addendum to this review.

$review_text.: There are four Das Keyboards:1) Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate: With no inscriptions on the keys. Nothing at all. Uses Cherry Blue mechanisms.2) Das Keyboard Model S Professional (this one): Sporting newly redesigned electronics provides full n-key rollover. Uses Cherry Blue mechanisms.3) Das Keyboard Model S Professional For Mac: Sporting golden-plated mechanical switches and a high speed USB Hub to connect your iPhone and iPad [NEW]. Uses Cherry Blue mechanisms.4) Das Keyboard Model S Professional Silent: This silent model (read not silent but less clicky) is ideal for people working in an open environment or for workers who need to type while talking on the phone. Uses Cherry Brown mechanisms. IMHO, this is the one to get.The 1961 IBM Selectric typewriter was the result of the first serious thought about keyboard ergonomics. The effort showed in every detail of operation. The adjustable but uniform key touch, spherical keycaps, the ability to handle and buffer multiple key presses, and its hallmark tactile feedback contributed to vastly improved typing speeds at any skill level. Every competent typist I knew for the next two decades refused to work with any other typewriter. Alas, in the frenzy to re-invent everything, we've thrown out most everything we learned. And, cheap flat undersized plastic paddles sitting atop flimsy mushy contacts that throw every possible wrench into eye-hand coordination have become the norm as professional typing skills (and High School typing classes) have sadly gone the way of the dodo.German Cherry Browns (tactile and less clicky) are the most preferred all purpose keys mechanisms (see first comment for reference) and there are basically 4 keyboards that use the Cherry Browns: This one theS Professional Silent Keyboard - Wired, the compact Cherry G80-1865, theFilco Majestouch-2, NKR, Tactile Action, USA, Yellow Keys Keyboard FKBN104M/EY2orFilco Majestouch-2, Tactile Action, Metallic Pink USA Keyboard FKBN87M/PWE2, and the Razer BlackWidow Silent (UPDATE: now only $80 at razerzone.com). I went with this keyboard for the best reputation as well as the lowest price ($133 w/ shipping). Smooth feather-touch but long throw softly clicking keys with cylindrical keycaps (as fingers are NOT flat) with a build quality that ends any chance for ghosting (missed key presses) and bouncing (extra key presses) should be a standard with every PC (as well as a more solid and precise mouse). This keyboard also includes a USB hub so short mouse cords are no longer a problem (my primary motivation for wireless). I don't need headset connections or lighted keys (I never need help finding the keys in the dark). I also prefer a separate wrist pad (3m Gel Wrist). While moving to a mechanical keyboard is impressive, going back turns out to be an even bigger change (you can never go back).While it may LOOK good to tilt up a keyboard like an old typewriter keyboard, doing so actually puts more pressure on your wrists. Plus, you should keep your wrists straight, angling them in towards each other, place your monitor directly in front at eye level or lower, and use two hands for entering key combinations. But, most importantly, your keyboard should be low enough so that your arms point slightly downward when you type - with your fingers slightly lower than your wrists (which should usually hover above the wrist pad). And, don't forget a chair with some lumbar support as well as brief stretching breaks every 20 minutes. Also note that wear to lettering can be accelerated (still taking a long time) if hand moisturizers have not been fully absorbed. But, the Filco padded key caps are known to have more problems than the lazer etched keys used by DAS, Cherry, and Razer. Otherwise, Filco - and Das - build quality is legendary (but Filco's are slightly overpriced IMHO as distribution is more controlled). The Razer advantages are their inexpensive pulsing backlighting on the Ultimates and extra keys with macro software (their mice are also legendary but I own all Logitechs). The new Razer Silent should be very popular with gaming enthusiasts, but they're only available from Razer directly (and so with a higer price - UPDATE: now only $80 at razerzone.com). Moreover, the function keys on the Razers are shifted right from a normal layout and the larger keys (esp the space bar) can reportedly stick.High-end keyboards still lack the variable key touch of the 1961 IBM Selectric so one must choose the switch characteristics to their liking / primary use (a better way). To that end I'll summarize the basic types of Cherry key switches:A linear switch - best for gaming (eg: hard to press Cherry MX Black to allow resting your hand on the key without accidentally pressing or easier Cherry Red) is like a doorbell - smooth travel with no bumpA tactile switch - best for typing and very good for gaming (eg: Cherry MX Brown with the smoothest and lightest touch for the fast control typist or gamer although accidental pressing is therefore possible or the harder to press so gamers often dislike limited production Cherry Clear or discontinued White) is like a light switch - halfway through you feel a bump and then the light comes onA clicky AND tactile switch - best for a lone hard-hitting typist as they are very noisy and often disliked by gamers (eg: Cherry Blue or Buckling Spring) is like a Bic pen - clicks loudly AND you feel a bumpAfter one has chosen the preferred key characteristics, here are good keyboard options:BLUE: This keyboard,104Key Ps2/Usb Adapt Keyb Blk,Razer BlackWidow Mechanical Gaming Keyboard,S Professional Keyboard - Wired, orUSA Filco Ninja Majestouch-2, NKR, Click Action, Keyboard FKBN104MC/EFB2BUCKLING SPRING: The classicIBM Model M 101-key KeyboardBROWN:DAS Keyboard Model S Ultimate Silent, Razer BlackWidow Stealth, compact Cherry G80-1865, orWhite Filco Majestouch-2, NKR, Tactile Action, USA Keyboard FKBN104M/EW2/ Filco Majestouch-2, Tactile Action, Metallic Pink USA Keyboard FKBN87M/PWE2WHITE: Elitekeyboards.com rare Leopold White or Deckkeyboards.com Legend TactileRED: Rosewill 9000RE or the rare Filco Majestouch-2 with Cherry Red FKBN104MR/EB2BLACK: Filco Majestouch-2, NKR, Linear Action, USA Keyboard FKBN104ML/EB2 or SteelSeries 7G Gaming KeyboardWhile iOne / XArmor / Ducky do use Cherry key switches, everything else is so cheap they're not comparable. Finally, I would unfortunately ignore all online reviews (including mine) as 99.9% are by people with experience limited to what they own (with the impossibility of finding all these keyboards together to try). No matter what / how you choose, however, I expect you'll be significantly better off.Please, let me know if you found this useful.

Fits snug but enough wiggle room to add a cable in the side pocket if needed (but won't do that) and bought it just to protect the NB itself (without being heavy nor bulky) since will be slipping it into a backpack when moving around anyways.

$review_text.: Don't let the other reviews mislead you, this express card works just fine, like a lot of hardware installs that I'm used to on Desktop computer, I figured the drivers and firmware were out of date, and probably the cause for most of the issues people have had with this device
A lot of laptop owners don't understand the difference between plug and play and true hardware installation
Hardware installation is simple, it's the same as plug and play the difference is just that one will have to find the updated drivers and if need be the most current firmware and have those items ready to install


I went to the Startech website, located the drivers for this EXACT model and downloaded.I was pleased to see the firmware was included with the download, another review had said a previous version didn't have the firmware bundled with it
I will leave the new updated link for the download at the end of the review


I am please that the card is flush mounted, it sits securely against my laptop and this has given me a much needed upgrade to true USB 3.0 my download transfer speeds are 480mb/s PERFECT! I am using this port with my Lexar card hub and having the 5GB/s bandwidth will come in handy


I have gone ahead and used the supplied bower adapter to give the unit a bit more juice, My 3TB external usb 3.0 drive required it to run at the faster speeds


All in all, a perfect upgrade and I couldn't be happier, if you are looking for something that will WORK and are willing to put a little elbow grease in for yourself, then I highly recommend this, if you don't feel comfortable in installing drivers and flashing firmware, then just hire someone to do it for you.http://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/USB-3.0/Cards/2-Port-Flush-Mount-USB-3-ExpressCard-Adapter~ECUSB3S254F#dnlds

$review_text.: My old Linksys WRT54GS finally died after maybe 8 years of faithful service so I bought this one.  Here are my simple observations:1. The Cox online automatic setup does not work.  I got a Cox technician on the phone and within 15 minutes was up and running.  The Zoom 5352 is on their approved list.2. This is a combined modem/wifi.  I really like it for that reason.  Really, in this day and age I'm surprised this isn't yet the norm.  It looks nice too.3. Range is very good.  HD Netflix streaming to the living room and far master bedroom is no problem at all.  Buffer load times are faster now.4. My upload speed more than doubled from 5mbs to 12mbs using this new/updated modem.  It probably could go faster but this is the service tier I pay for.  I get 30+ download speed and 15ms ping here.Now for some negatives:5. The power cord is 5' or less.  It can be too short if you have it on a bookshelf.  I had to put my battery UPS on a pedestal in order to reach the shelf the modem is on.  What a stupid thing to cheap out on.  That extra few feet of cord length is very useful if you need it.6. The biggest negative for me is DNS configurability.  If you use an alternate DNS server like Google DNS or OpenDNS...this modem/router will NOT work.  I researched this issue, found no solution. If you've never heard of OpenDNS - check it out.  It's a great way to filter out all the porn/adult web sites automatically that you don't want your 6 yr old getting into.  Another advantage can be better speeds and incredible reliability with no downtime.7. The firmware cannot be flashed.  If you're a DD-WRT fan forget it.  I never bothered flashing my old router but some folks love to tinker.Install tip:Have the S/N and CM MAC # ready when you call the ISP for the install.  No need to flip the unit over - there is an identical sticker right on the box.I give this unit 5 stars for doing it's mission and 4 stars for overall configurability.

$REVIEW.: Let me first say that I have tried most headsets (Astro A40 w/wireless mix amp, Turtle Beach PX5, ect.) but none of them offer what this one does.  It is Truly wireless!  As in no wires, not a single one to be exact!  Other wireless headsets have a wire from a mix amp to your headset and or have an ungodly amount of wires connected to the PS3 and the wireless transmitter base.Simulated surround?  Yea, and it works!  It's no truly Dolby Digital System like offered on the Tritton AX Pro's, but the Trittons are a wired system so it's not really a fair comparison.  But if your Gaming I can assure you that you will be able to pinpoint the direction and location of sounds.Battery Life is good, giving a good 5-6 hrs of use.  I did find that the battery tends to drain while turned off, but I guess that is expected as they can not truly be absent of using power if they are to send a connect signal.  Not a big deal, but if you let them sit for a few weeks they will have drained down some and may need a quick charge.Audio quality is good, though it may lack in the midrange frequencies.  Mic quality is great but lacks output to the headset, so you can not hear yourself very well.Over all?  It is a great headset that has since replaced the others I've had, and at a fraction of the price!
$review_summary.: Finally a truly wireless headset!

$REVIEW.: This review is for the tablet alone.  Lenovo reneged on their sale offer for the whole package after confirming my order.Pros:Full Windows 8.Charges quickly.Good battery life.Includes adapter for microUSB to USB.Excellent display - both size and clarity.Responsive touchscreen.Runs most, but not all, Windows 7 programs and drivers.Internal Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work fine except Bluetooth audio which is unpredictable.I do switch back and forth with Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth USB dongles for additional features or range; they work fine.  The Bluetooth dongle is necessary for Bluetooth audio.Good audio.  Nice fidelity but not much volume through internal speakers; excellent signal through 3.5mm.  Sad Bluetooth audio unless you upgrade to a Bluetooth USB dongle.Good video with digital files, streaming, capture card, TV Tuner, and USB DVD.I get 7+ hours battery operation with heavy audio/video and web surfing use and a couple of USB loads.Cons:The tablet has a single microUSB port that doubles as a charging port. No other USB port or charging port.  You cannot charge while connected to a USB device or connect to a USB device while charging unless you are connected to the optional keyboard-dock, which has been discontinued!!!  There is no aftermarket device, either.Summary:The bonehead charging/USB design from Microsoft and Lenovo overrides anything good about the tablet.JimUpdate March 17, 2014The internal Bluetooth is now totally nonfunctional for A2DP (stereo audio).  Lenovo customer service is no help - they say that it is a software issue and software support is not covered under the warranty.JimUpdate June 2, 2014Based on the design defects and lack of support, I will never buy another Lenovo computer.Jim

They have clear plastic on the outside to hold a wrap around label
Avery has a free template on their website for DVD case labels, but it didn't fit right, so I made my own using a 3-cell Word table


There are clips inside to hold a book, and the regular push button hub to hold the disk in place

They snap shut just like a regular movie case, too
These were way cheaper than any I could find locally
When I need more I'll order the same ones again.

$review_text.: I bought this for a second DTV tuner I own
I also have an old Radio Shack set of unamplified rabbit ears which I've never found anything better for DTV


This Phillips amplified antenna gives me about equal performance to the obsolete Radio Shack one
I live about 15 miles from the broadcast towers
We get 6 digital channels here so far


I kind of have to tune the antenna so I get a 7 bar signal strength for each channel

I can peak the signal at 10 bars on most channels, but the other channels may become unwatchable.The main secret is don't use the supplied RG-59 coax lead

Go to your electronics store and purchase a larger RG-6 coax lead


This will improve your signal strength, and in my case made the difference between receiving our highest channel (18 PBS) or not receiving it.

It was a great player but wasn't Blue-Ray so I replaced it with the New Sony Blue-Ray player. It's great one of the features I like is that if you stop a dvd during the playback and take it out of the player for whatever reason, when you put it back in it starts right where you left off. Even if you put it back in 2 weeks later. It's has a ton of places you can download tv shows and movies from not just from Netflix or hulu or amazon. But about 6 others some free some not. It's a player I use every day.

$REVIEW.: I wanted Sirius radio to be able to listen to Howard Stern.  My parents got me a Sportster 5 for my birthday a little over 3 years back.  The radio wasn't too hard to hook up in my car.  I also got a home dock for my office that was easy to hook up.  The radio was easy to use and the features decent.I had the radio around 1 year and 4 months.  Suddenly the radio would no longer keep power.  It would restart itself or turn itself completely off.  Sometimes it would turn itself right back on, sometimes it would turn itself on after a few to several minutes.  Sometimes it would lose all of my settings after restarting itself.  I could sometimes get it to come right back on and work for a bit by wiggling it in the cradle or thumping it.  I knew it wasn't the cradle or the power source, because the same thing happened no matter which dock I used.  I called Sirius and of course it was after the 1 year warranty.  All they could offer me was another radio for a "discounted" price and pay another activation fee.  I decided to get another Sportster 5 which turned out to be a huge mistake.Again I have had the new radio for around a year and a half.  Now I have the same issues with this newer radio.  I called Sirius and explained the situation.  Again in broken English I was given the option to buy another "discounted" radio and pay to have it activated.  I declined this time since at the time Howard Stern had not made the decision to resign.  Now that Howard will be back for 5 years, I am left trying to decide what to do.  I am not going to waste my money on another one of these Sportster models and I am not very confident on the other models.  I also hate Sirius' customer service and lack of phone employees that can speak English which can be easily understood.  I am in the market for a new car, so perhaps I will just get one with Sirius preinstalled.  Perhaps it is time to go the smartphone route.  In any case, I will not be throwing my money away on a radio that will last less than 2 years.  With Sirius' customer service and garbage equipment it is no wonder stock prices keep going down even with the best radio personality of all time on their channels.

$REVIEW.: I debated quite a bit on a toolset to get. This one was perfect: it had the tools I need and NO soldering iron. Any iron you get in a kit like this is destine to fail. These tools are good quality for the price and everything you need for computer repair. I cut my own cables for my computers, and this kit is exactly what I need. In terms  of your average computer goer, more than enough. I just need to buy a separate soldering iron.Not only is it useful for computer repair, but any electronics for the matter. The torx drivers make it perfect for cell phones, laptops and any electronic device I have. The mini-screwdrivers are perfect for tiny situations and the carry case is icing on the cake.My ONLY con so far is the voltage checker. While it does its job, a Volt Meter (gives actual readings) would have been better, but that's just being picky.

$review_text.: The basics have already been covered, so I am going to share a few tips on living with an iMac G5 20".1. It is wide, but it is also on the tallish side. Some computer desks may not be compatible with the height. I put shelving in my office before the iMac G5 was announced, and wouldn't you know it - the shelves were installed ONE inch too low. So, double-check your clearances before you bring this monster home.2. The SuperDrive has ate everything I have ever thrown at it - DVD+r, -r, you name it. So, there are only two considerations on how to feed the beast - money, and time. The iMac doesn't seem to mind cheap or expensive disks, but sometimes cheap quality disks take longer to burn. So if you want to go a little cheaper on disks, be prepared to give up some time.3. Burnin' rubber. Yep, this is a G5. Would you buy a Corvette to have it sit there and idle? Nosireebob. So the first thing you are going to do when you plug in and boot this bad boy is open the System Preferences, and click on Energy Saver. Click on the options tab and down on the left you are going to click on the pull-down menu next to where it says "processor performance". Set this menu to "Highest" and never look back. I haven't noticed the fan noise is atrocious, and I seem to be free of all problems I hear about other iMac G5 owners who keep their computers on "Automatic".4. Take every opportunity to make your PC-usin' friends drool. They pretend not to like your Mac, but trust me - on the inside they are eatin' their ever-lovin' hearts out. Do they have anything in their universe even remotely this cool? Nope, and they never will. Plus, they still have to wait nearly 18 months for "Vista"!5. Three words - killer surround sound. You now have what may be the most killer computer in the known universe, don't botch it now with cheap speakers or (GASP!) running with the internal speakers. Get thee and thine hence and purchase thee mighty, thundering speakers with wattage that bespeaks the power of God! Trust me, you don't want to watch movies on this big, beautiful, extra gi-nourmous widescreen and listen to the built-in speakers. It ruins the effect, and how. Speakers are like cars - there is no such thing as too much power.So let's recap - measure twice, feed the beast decent disks, warp speed Scotty, rub it in, and crank it a notch or thirty past 11. Do these things, and the iMac G5 will leave a smile on your face a mortican can't erase.

$review_text.: I've had this camcorder for a month or so now and I've been really happy with this camcorder


I use this camcorder to take pictures of my wife and kid occasionally
The video quality is acceptable when there's sufficient light, at low light the video gets grainy but there's a built in light that can be turn on (manually or automatically)
The microphone was also pretty sensitive and the sound in my videos are good of good quality
You can take snapshots in the middle of recording a video, the  quality is ok for facebook but it you're looking for high quality you should get a digital camera

It has no built in memory, but recording to SDHC is convenient and downloading to PC is very easy, just insert the SD card and grab the AVI files, I haven't had any problems with the encoding.If your budget is $200-$300 then you're probably comparing this JVC MS120 with the Canon FS200 or the flip ultra HD (maybe the Sony/Panasonic ones as well)

I went with JVC since Canon is more expensive, flip ultra HD has very limited controls and the reviews of Sony/Panasonic ones weren't that great


And the JVC has kept me happy so far.



$SUMMARY.: Works great for camcorders in this price range

$review_text.: I wear glasses, so when ear buds became common I was thrilled because over-the-ear headphones always seemed to press the frames of my glasses against my head in uncomfortable ways.  But the sound immersion and quality just isn't the same, so I always keep my eyes open for headphones that might work for me.  I think that with these Polk headphones, I've finally found one!The headphones are pretty lightweight, considering their size and bulk.  The ears are very well-padded, and after fiddling around for a few minutes I was able to find a way to make them tight enough that they don't slide around as I walk through the house, but not so tight that they squeeze the ends of my glasses into my scalp.  I'm not confident that they'd stay in place if I was out jogging or something really active, but for hanging out at home and playing on the computer, they're fine.I'm not a sound snob, so I can't go into great technical detail about the quality of these headphones.  I think they sound great, fantastic, generally wonderful - but I'm just an average listener who usually uses ear buds.  But I'll be honest - if you're some sort of music professional who needs headphones for work, I honestly don't know whether these would meet your specifications.  Luckily, I'm sure there are other reviewers who can address more technical questions.I was really pleased by how well this worked for phone calls, too.  The quality was just as good as if I was holding the cellphone to my ear, and people that I talked to said they could hear me clearly.The three button control is really handy, since I'm usually listening to my iPod and if it's tucked away in my pocket, it's easier to quickly touch the button on the headset than to dig the electronic device out - especially when someone starts talking to me without waiting for me to take the headphones off first.I think the gold buckle design is a lot of fun.  If you are going to be wearing headphones anyway, why not wear something that stands out a little?  I'm so glad that I was given the chance to try a pair of these headphones out.
$Helpful?.: [1, 2] $SUMMARY.: Fantastic set of headphones for anyone!

$REVIEW.: The first two units had defective battery power management systems. They would not take or hold a charge. Both worked fine when powered from 12v power source. However, since they didn't hold a charge, a simple stop of the vehicle would cause your route to be lost and needed to be re-entered to continue on your trip. The third model's battery power management system works as designed. The system's battery holds a charge and continues to hold your route when the vehicle is turned off.Test any new unit battery power system thoroughly when new. TomTom did replace each defective unit. I did have to pay the cost of shipping the units back to TomTom. I still like the units performance for navigation, but I was certainly disappointed that the first two units were defective.

Not as clear as it used to be. It does come with plenty of cord and I used this in my Dakota truck. So that is pretty long. Though the quality isn't the same it still does the job and I can still tell what is going on. Might upgrade to a better camera later though.

$REVIEW.: A &#34;retro&#34; look with that old time leather camera case look!  Takes me back 50 years (yes I am rather old) to my first Brownie and Pentax 35mm case!  The leather is thick enough to provide protection from the dings of swinging the camera and case from the shoulder.  The snaps seem secure enough for light to medium duty.  My only reason for a 4 Star rating is that I have to remove the camera from the case to access the miniUSB connection.  However, as the camera is wifi capable, the cable will not be an issue once (if ever) I figure out how to use the wifi feature on the Canon SX280 HS!  I would recommend this case, although perhaps not the color of the case (especially for younger trendy folks) highly.  Leave the retro stuff for me!

$REVIEW.: I started out with a cheap Samsung sound bar initially and it was OK for the price I paid. However, I wanted more. More sound, more design, more bass! I was eyeballing the Klipsch SB3 for quite sometime and when I had saw the price drop, I jumped! The sound is amazing and extremely responsive. The subwoofer will literally shake my 400sq living room. Music sounds excellent and movies realistic. For the price, you cannot beat it. Set up was a no brainer and easily paired to my DirecTV remote. Originally my 60&#34; Samsung sat on an entrainment center but as soon as I put the beefy sound bar in front of it, I knew it was time to wall mount my TV. I had to purchase a longer optical cored because I installed my wires within the wall. It looks fantastic.My ONLY issue (if you'd like to call it that) is that there is no bluetooth connectivity. This for myself is a pretty big downer as I play music a lot in my household. However, it does have an auxiliary port to plug into which works fine. This is the only thing keeping my rating at a 4 star over 5. You'll be pleased with the sound and know Klipsch knows what they're doing when it comes to audio. My old soundbar sits at my bar downstairs and even though it doesn't sound &#34;bad&#34; the difference is remarkable!

$review_text.: These are the first high-end speakers that I've ever purchased before, so keep that in mind.  I wanted speakers that were going to reproduce accurate sound for video editing (I'm a film student) as well as enjoying music.  These speakers do just what I wanted.  The burn-in time is real; it takes a while for the speakers to really open up, but once they do, it's great.  I went ahead and got a Pioneer sub to pair with the speakers, but in all honesty, they really don't need it.  The bass is tight, the highs are sweet but not quite as high as prominent as I'd like.  They're pretty powerful speakers, but don't expect them to completely surround you in a large room.  I'd recommend getting the stands for these if you're looking to work with them at a close range.  I haven't had the heat issue that others have mentioned, but be sure to give these speakers room to ventilate.  The construction is phenomenal; I can see why Audioengine is proud of their products.

$review_text.: If you have any experience with applying screen protectors you will soon see a major difference in quality here


I purchased this for my new Canon S95 because I don't particularly care for thin film protectors with their associated optical distortion issues
Since this is actually glass and not plastic it's slightly thicker than you might expect


But don't be deterred as it has virtually no distortion and is dimensionally precise

It fits the S95 screen perfectly.As for the installation

I suggest you start with a high quality microfiber cloth and alcohol

Place a few drops of alcohol on you camera screen taking care to prevent any from running off onto the camera housing, I used an eye dropper

Next use the microfiber cloth and very gently wipe away the smudges and skin oils from you where you fingers have touched the screen
You might need to repeat the process a few times using different parts of the cloth to prevent recontaminating the screen


You'll know it's right when you look across the screen at an angle and has a mirror clean reflection.Of course the trickiest part of the installation is the alignment


I started by removing only the screen protector's adhesive backing film


I turned the camera on to activate the LCD display and help gauge the location of the camera screen's thin (black) border outline (LCD edge perimeter)


Keeping the camera on and holding the protector only by its edges, I visually aligned it as best as I could and barely allowed it to touch the LCD screen.Naturally, it didn't line up exactly on the first try so I ever so carefully lifted the protector by its short edge (using an X-acto knife) so I could readjust it's position

Honestly, it took about 3 attempts but it was never so sticky that I was unable to remove it.When it was finally right, I used the microfiber cloth to gently press it down apply even pressure over the entire surface
As a preventative measure, I left the transparent protection film on the screen protector (top side) while applying pressure minimizing the possibility of scratching the protector lens during installation

Once attached, just peel the protection film off and you're good to go...Overall, I'd say this glass screen protector is the best quality I've come across, it's that impressive


It should provide excellent protection from potential scratches (but not severe bumps)
It's so optically clear it's practically invisible and I never notice it when using my S95 which is exactly what you want!

$REVIEW.: I like the compactness of the pancake lens and how it makes the camera (in my case an NX300) *almost* pocketable.Pros:- Nice and fast at f2.- Best for portrait and low-light (yeah, I'm the Minister of the Obvious here)- Great sharpness for the priceCons:- No image stablization (OIS)- No iFn functionalitySome of my favorite shots (of all-time) have been taken with this lens.  Not bad since I've only had it for about a month!  I can live without OIS and iFn on this lens because I haven't had a lot of issue getting the shots I want when shooting off of a tripod.

$REVIEW.: Contrary to another review, I found that with a bit of customization, I could get to use every cubic inch of space in this comfortable pack. However, the first thing I missed was a sternum belt. I fixed this by buying a parachute clasp and affixing it to the adjustment straps from the shoulder straps. I have a Canon 5D Mark II, a 300 mm f/4 lens, a 24-105 lens, a 20mm lens, a Tamron 28 - 300 zoom a 50m Canon and a set of extension tubes. Plus a Polaroid PoGo printer all in the lower compartment. The Mark II's battery charger is in the top along with my iPod and extra batteries. A MacBook 13" fit easily in the compartment along with a 100gig HD. The whole thing weighs 26 pounds. Time will tell if it all works on an African Safari.
$SUMMARY.: No wasted space after customization

$REVIEW.: This mouse is great for use with my netbook. I really like the small form factor of the usb wireless plug. It barely sticks out of my netbook. Because of this, I can just leave the USB plugged it without affecting the portability of the netbook. Even when I am not using the mouse, the plug is so small that I just forget it is there.If the plug is so small, it could be easily lost except that on the bottom of the mouse is a little dock that the USB plug locks into. Of course, if you forget it is there, you might spend a while looking for it because it is firmly and snugly stored away.The only downside of this mouse is for those that are used to more buttons. I am used to a higher DPI, 5 button mouse and missing the 4th and 5th button took some getting used to. However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the benefits gained from being no longer tied to the netbooks touchpad.

$REVIEW.: 2012 Travel Zoom Digital Camera Round-UpWay, way back in 2009, a lengthy group test of pocketable long-zoom travel cameras was performed by one of the most popular sources for digital camera reviews. It was only three years ago and the camera specifications were all within a narrow range: The tested cameras all had 10 - 12MP CCD sensors, zoom ability was 10x-12x, none could record video at full 1080 HD, and most screens were of the 230k pixel, 2.7 inch to 3 inch variety. The winners in that match-up happened to be Panasonics, with Panasonic ZS-3 having a street price of $380 or thereabouts, at that "ancient" time.Onto 2011, where another, larger group test was conducted. The cameras as a class offered BSI (back side illumination) sensors more often, LCD screen resolution was improved to 460k (or better) and the long zoom notion was no longer 10x, but 14x to the (at that time) 18x Nikon S9100 as the class leader in the zoom department. GPS units were added as a "feature" and the winners were the Canon SX230 (a verdict I agree with) and the Nikon S9100 which I personally found to be a spectacular disaster of a camera.It is just a year later, and BSI sensors have become standard fare, claimed to be twice as sensitive as the CCD variety. The 14x zoom of the 2011 Canon SX230, actually a fine camera, now seems anemic compared to the 16x - 20x base capabilities of the current crop. I don't particularly subscribe to putting a price on a memory, but as a bonus 2012 compact long zooms, despite having more expensive sensors, greater usable magnification ranges, better video capability, and more features the price of entry is no more, often less than three years ago.Some of the common "complaints" about this class of camera are nonsensical. You'll redundantly hear about the lack of an EVF, the electronic viewfinders, RAW capture (meaning s-l-o-w with the intent of post-processing) and some equally nonsensical carping about low-light. The reason to enjoy this class of camera is that it fits in a shirt pocket, weighs one half pound or less, and has long zoom capability. If you don't care about bulk, heft, and zoom range . . . you are looking at the completely wrong platform of camera for your needs. The camera in your pocket captures the event when the others are not with you. A seven ounce camera is more pleasant to carry than a two or four pound hunk of equipment; a 16x zoom offers composition possibilities that no 3.8x, 4x, and 5x zoom can possibly match.Of more importance is shooting performance, handling, overall speed. No one wants a camera they have to wait for-- by then, the shot you wanted may already have ceased to exist. Image stabilization ability is also a very important component of this class of camera. There are only three basic components: lens, sensor, processor. The software / cpu combination is often designated as an "engine," with a newer bit of programing called a better version of the engine. How they work together, under the most diverse circumstances, is what makes for the satisfying travel compact long zoom. The basics, in 2012, for a camera to qualify as a modern compact travel zoom appears to be 15x zoom or better, a BSI sensor, and at least some HD video capability.Of the last dozen cameras I've spent quality time with over the last year, few actually qualify as those that I can confidently recommend. The 2011 Canon SX230 is one, as is the current enhanced zoom (20x) 2012 Canon SX260. The 2012  Panasonic ZS-15 is another, perhaps the most well-rounded and versatile value out there to this point. The unevenly performing Fuji F660EXR was a failboat with the horrific video performance sending it soundly to the cannot recommend list.Now comes a final 2012 model long-zoom compact, the Samsung WB750. It is easy to confuse the WB750 with the Wi-Fi version, the WB750F, but they are different cameras with different sensors: the "F" edition has a 14.2 MB CCD type sensor, not the 12.5 MB BSI CMOS of the WB750. The WB750F also lacks full HD video, stereo audio, the slow-motion video modes, and so forth. It is easy to confuse the two, my feeling is that Samsung could have made the differences far more easy to discern. Yet, the $350 or so W850F model does have a BSI sensor, further adding to the muddle.Sensor size is perhaps the best barometer of image potential, though the industry seems to go to great lengths to disguise it. More megapixels on a tiny surface means each photosite gets less light, must be smaller, and  there is more opportunity for signal cross-talk. Yet, the number of megapixels has long been touted, though more megapixels tends to diminish image quality potential.The WB750 was actually announced September 1, 2011, to little fanfare. The original press release stated, "Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today announced the launch of the WB750 camera - featuring a proprietary BSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS sensor that ensures consistent professional images and video. Featuring a newly-redesigned image sensor, lens and image processor, the WB750 brings to bear a range of new technologies to deliver unprecedented levels of performance and ease-of-use. The WB750 also features an 18x optical zoom with 24x Smart Zoom technology, making it the longest ever zoom in Samsung's compact camera portfolio."  Rightly or wrongly, mostly wrongly, we tend to pay more attention to brand names than actual product. It tends to mean that Sony, Nikon, Canon, and Panasonic get better coverage whether deserved or not. Such is the blinding power of the mythical world of product branding.While the specifications of the Samsung WB750 would have been astounding a year prior to its original announcement, most of them in July, 2012, fit the middle of the road. A year ago, the 18x zoom would have been equaled by very few, such as the frustratingly bad Nikon CoolPix S9100 I tried to work with, that sounded like a tractor when I used it, had erratic image stabilization for stills and no effective image stabilization for video. The WB750 has essentially a 24-432mm range, wider than many, has a panoramic feature that Canon still doesn't, and offers smaller image size high-speed video that many lack: 440fps @ 224x160 and 250fps @ 368x272 pixels. In night scene mode, the shutter speed goes all the way down to 16 seconds if you prefer.For purposes of comparison, I'm pitting the Samsung WB750 primarily against the Panasonic ZS-15, perhaps my favorite travel zoom to date.Battery life: Panasonic wins, though not by much at 260 shots vs. 225 for the WB750 (CIPA standard). Both have in-camera charging, requiring the purchase of an external charger to avoid taking the camera out of commission by plugging it in.Lens:  f/3.2 - f/5.8, 18x, 24mm-432mm for the Samsung vs. F3.3 - F5.9, 16x, 24mm-384 mm for the ZS-15. Advantage Samsung, for the slightly brighter lens and longer true optical zoom, though neither "advantage" is apparent to me.Size: At 4.15 in. x 2.34 in x .98 inch thick  and a weight of 6.7 oz., the Samsung  is notably slimmer than the 6.6 oz. 4.13 x 2.27 x 1.31 inch Panasonic ZS-15.  The stated thickness is misleading from both companies, as the cameras are thicker through the lens portion than published. The Samsung is still the thinner camera, if minimally.LCD: Both have 460K three inch LCD's. They are close, a slight edge to the Panasonic for its "high angle mode."Price: The Samsung is currently available at $150 - $170 street, clearly less than the $190 - $230 recent pricing of the Panasonic ZS-15. For the record, I actually paid $150 for my WB750 vs. $230 for my ZS-15. This isn't exactly dinner, dancing, and Chilean Sea Bass money difference but still-- the Samsung is currently a better value by a clean forty dollars, if it does what you want it to do.Video: The Samsung is more fully featured with stereo sound and high-speed capabilities. Also, the full18x true optical zoom is available during video as well. The WB750 allows taking a few *full* resolution stills during video where the Panasonic captures two total in 3.5M (16:9) reduced resolution. The Samsung's fast zoom easily outruns its autofocus ability. However, the Samsung picks up far less camera noise with the "Sound Alive" on and as a result, it has superior audio quality.Shooting Performance: Start-up times to first shot are both quick, 1.6 seconds for the Panasonic vs. 1.7 seconds for the Samsung. The Panasonic, if anything seems to focus faster but both are reasonably quick. Neither camera is going to keep you waiting; both offer 10fps burst modes if only for a limited number of frames at full resolution: 4 frames for the Panasonic, 8 frames for Samsung at 10fps. Shot to shot times are similar, about one second for the ZS-15, about 1-1/4 seconds for the Samsung. The Samsung gives you a brief "processing" screen more often than the ZS-15 does. The Panasonic is far peppier when using the flash at 2 seconds vs. 3 seconds or so for the Samsung. The slow-charging flash of the Samsung is a negative.Videography: Travel zooms, as a class, are very poor substitutes for camcorders. The audio invariably picks up some motor noise and due to the pathetically small mics, audio quality is limited with no possibility of using an external mic. Still, some are better than others with a recently tested Fuji F660EXR yielding uniformly tragic results. Yet, the Samsung has the cleanest audio of the long-zoom compacts I've tested this year.Unlike many travel zooms (Canon SX230) both the Panasonic ZS-15 and the Samsung can take a few stills while you are recording video. In the case of the ZS-15, the value is dubious to non-existent. In an indoor, very low-light test I found that the ZS-15 captured very clear, sharp, ISO 1000 stills. You get but two still captures in video mode, they are 3.5M, and used under the same conditions they were not only low-resolution, but captured at a horribly grainy ISO 3200. Most small travel zooms pick up motor noise when zooming: it is to be expected. The best solution is avoid zooming as much as possible, or displace the audio with music, etc. Samsung at least recognizes this with a "Sound Alive On" mode that is designed to reduce zoom noise. It does work, actually far better than I expected. While the Samsung does have stereo mics, this advantage is primarily a "spec-sheet only" benefit in a compact travel zoom with tiny onboard mics that can offer minimal stereo separation. Nevertheless the Samsung shines brightly in audio quality compared to the Panasonic.The current notion of wanting, much less needing 1080p capture from a non-dedicated still camera is silly, more marketing than beneficial. Too soon we forget the movies we enjoyed, and still enjoy from the "lousy" DVD format: 29.97 fps, 480 interlaced resolution. Yet, DVD is still the dominate medium in market share. Resolution alone is a very poor indicator of video quality. Consider that even the full HD of 1080 rates only as low resolution in still image terms. The native resolution of the Panasonic ZS-15 sensor is 4000x3000, I suppose we'd call it 3000p if it was video, the native resolution of this Samsung is 4096x3072.Clearly, the notion of sensor native resolution does not translate into any meaningful measure of video prowess, nor does the resolution of the video mode itself. In a compact long zoom, the best that can be hoped for is in-focus moving images with good color fidelity, the notion of excellent audio quality is a myth. This is why, from a video perspective, there isn't too much to get excited about here, nor could there be. The best video is obtained when not zooming at all and with the use of a tripod for full zoom. Even then, audio quality can only be amateurish. The edge in video goes to the Samsung, as full-resolution images can be taken while in video mode, and the Samsung offers more fun novelty-type modes, including high-speed capture.ConclusionsThe Samsung WB750 comes as an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. Prices vary for all kinds of reasons with digital cameras but I can't call the WB750 at $150 - $170 anything less than a spectacularly good bargain. It joins the Panasonic ZS-15 and the Canon SX260 as the only compact long-zooms I can recommend to anyone seeking this platform of camera.The Panasonic "Intelligent Zoom" does retain image sharpness better than its competitors when exceeding its true optical limitation; Samsung has a "24x Smart Zoom" that is essentially an in-camera crop. There is a curve of diminishing returns when magnifying images: I'm just not clever enough to be able to tell you what it is. The "long zoom" compact used to be 10x, but I certainly have had several instances where that proved insufficient. Even last year's Canon SX230, a very competent unit, seems underpowered compared to all three of these despite its 14x zoom. Twenty-eight percent more zoom ability in the WB750 vs. the SX230 is substantial but the eleven percent additional of the SX260 vs. the WB750 is far less noticeable. Note the Canon lens is F3.5 wide-angle to F6.8, a bit slower than either the Samsung or the Panasonic, but in real-world terms this isn't a noticeable difference. They are all competitive; where the true optical zoom becomes the most noticeable is during video capture, something that none of the three do superbly well. Those that want the 20x of the Canon and think the GPS is of value could be easily swayed. In my terms, for my uses, the Samsung and the Panasonic are better fits.The Samsung is a slight winner in pocketability, with a thickness of just under an inch, in at least some areas. Both of the others are about 30% thicker in places: the Samsung can be slipped in where the others cannot.The display is vital for shot composition. All three have generally good, 460K displays. The Panasonic display is more reflective, yet that is combated by Power LCD" and "High Angle" modes. The Samsung has an auto mode, but gives you three basic choices: normal, dark, and bright. It doesn't sound as sexy or technological as "Power LCD" but it is the same idea. Canon features the "PureColor II G" LCD, which also imposes a bit of needless technobabble.  Non are as good as the higher-resolution, 921k screens, as good as the fold out and swivel "articulated" LCDs, or nearly as good as an EVF in bright sunlight. Yet, they are all larger (3 inch) than the standard fare of a couple of years ago and are double the pixels of the screens of a couple of years ago as well. None are anywhere close to perfection in bright, sunny conditions but all are improved and far more helpful when reviewing images prior to transfer to your PC.If you feel a GPS is invaluable or the 20x optical zoom is vital, then the Canon SX260 will likely be your choice. Neither of these features are particularly important to me, the GPS of precisely zero benefit, so for me . . . the SX260 would be a 3rd place choice, yet it is a very, very good long-zoom compact with no great negatives to stop the purchase excepting price, although by some (Sony) levels, the Canon seems a strong value.That leaves the ZS-15 and the Samsung and it is a very difficult to find a clear winner. I can't shake the feeling that if this Samsung had "Sony" branded on it, it would have already have been heralded as the marvel of the age and the loudest screaming deal of screaming deals. It is a sleeper in the compact long zoom class, largely ignored compared to competitive models without solid basis that I Have been able to discover.Yet, the all-round shooting performance of the ZS-15 is faster than the Samsung; the ZS-15 processor is clearly quicker. The Samsung creative modes are surprisingly good, the audio is better, and the full-resolution still ability during video is of clear value. The Samsung rendition of the Panorama mode is excellent; up / down / left / right, just move the camera and the WB750 does the rest. And, you have more smart filters to experiment with as well as high-speed video.The all-around winner, for my purposes, is the Panasonic ZS-15, with a higher percentage of "keeper" photos than the rest in a variety of conditions. The Samsung WB750 remains a great value, as it is both feature-laden, economical, and takes very good video if you lay off the zoom and the audio is actually very clean. For indoor use, it falls behind both Panasonic and Canon for its turtle-slow to charge up flash, and both weak and unpredictable color saturation and cast. You can get decent indoor pictures with the Samsung, but all too often it is a slow and tedious process.The Panasonic ZS-15 wins, the Samsung remains a surprisingly good value best suited for outdoor use and also if the audio quality of your video is important to you. The Canon SX260 gets the nod if you want a GPS, is still a very worthy travel companion, but it lacks in the video department, and does not have the manual controls of either of the more economical choices, nor a panorama mode.In the value department, the WB750 is very hard to fault and the full-resolution during video ability is something most of its competition lacks. Nevertheless, its shooting performance is only average compared to the ZS-15 and SX260: the ZS-15 @ fifty bucks more, the SX260 at about twice the price.For video ability and 18x zoom value, the Samsung does well. Six-eight months ago, it would have been far more appealing though, as today (12/2012) the ZS-15 is a better still-image camera with prices now running as low as $149, the ZS-15 is tough to beat.Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman and Randy Wakeman Outdoors.

$review_text.: I picked up one of these for my Asus EeePC Netbook.  It works great!  I chose this SSD for several reasons.  First, this one has the lowest power consumption rating of all the SSD drives I researched.  It should extend my battery life watching movies on long flights.Second, I like the durability of SSD's.  I don't have worry about physical damage from rough handling or dropping, since this will be my main traveling computer.Third, low noise and low heat.  I've been working with computers for 20 years and I absolutely hate noisy computers.  This SSD drive makes no noise.  It also reduces the internal heat of the netbook, so the cooling fan doesn't need to run as much.  Heat is also a waste of battery power.I re-installed Windows 7 Starter, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Office Tools, Firefox, Skype and all the OEM Crapware.  Only 14gb of disk space was used.  I was able to use the Windows 7 'Shrink Partition' feature to free up 8gb of space for a Linux partition, and 16gb of free disk space to spare for movies.  I would have given this drive 5 stars if it was a larger size.  At this price, I shouldn't complain.  Most other drives in this price range only have 30-32gb of space.I was concerned that this drive might be too slow.  The specs have decent read speed but the write speed is rated slower.  It's definitely faster than the factory 160gb Hitachi TravelStar that came with the Netbook.  Installing the OS was much faster than with the factory hard drive.  This drive is a trade off between speed and disk space.  Hey, it's only a $300 netbook.  I didn't think it was worth spending $200 for bigger faster SSD.  I plan to put the old hard drive in an external USB enclosure for extra storage and backing up my data.This drive is rated at 1,000,000 hours Mean Time Between Failure.  That's about 114 years of continuous use.  Funny that it only has a 3 year warranty though.I'm very happy with this drive.  It was between one and the 30gb OCZ Vertex.  I went with the Intel drive because it had 10gb more space for the money and used less power.  The OSZ drive has a write speed almost 4 times faster, but has 10gb less space and uses more power.  Even 40gb is kind of small, but it works for me and has enough room for a dual boot between Windows and Linux.  Next time I upgrade a computer, I'll probably go for the 80gb Intel SSD.

$REVIEW.: I installed the Yamaha RX-V673 over the last two days.  It is the hub of my entertainment center:  Samsung television, CD player, Sony blue ray that also streams Netflix, HDMI from computer that acts as DVR for over-the-air television using Windows 7 Media Center.  I also use Media Center to stream my photos and MP3 music to the TV/Entertainment Center.  I tie all this together with a Harmony One universal remote.The receiver works well, as noted in the reviews and Yamaha descriptons.  The Internet Radio streams are solid.  All the stations we usually stream were available (and a lot more).  It allowed me to discard my aging Dlink DSM 320 media center that I has been using to stream internet radio through my entertainment center.You can use the receiver to stream music, photos, etc. using media server software (such as Tversity) on your PC.  This is more complex to setup and redundant for Internet Radio and Windows Media Center, but it insures you against the remote possibility that vTuner should discontinue its service.The menu system on the receiver takes a little getting used to, and the remote is functional but feels cheap.  The Harmony One universal remote (or some other universal remote) is almost a necessity if you are tying all this equipment together.  I spent more time programming the remote to coordinate the equipment  than I did attaching speakers, etc.  The Harmony One remote works well with the Yamaha receiver after you get the hang of customizing buttons.I'm pleased, and pleasantly surprised by how well vTuner streams Internet radio.

$review_text.: I have tried several keyboard protectors ever since my first MacBook Air got fried after an accidental spill

 This one is hands-down the best one of the bunch, and &#34;premium ultra thin&#34; means exactly that - premium quality, and it IS ultra-thin


 With other protectors (that were much cheaper) the keyboard protector also left imprints on the screen, and I was weary of seeing this one doing the same - but, surprise! - it does not, so it IS super-thin and does not seem to collect the oil from fingers as readily

 Overall, I am a super-happy camper, and considering buying one more - just in case


:-)

$review_text.: Always bought Nikon cameras and have had great experiences.  My last camera was the Nikon Coolpix S8100.  That took incredible pictures but I always took it fishing and to the beach and sand got in the telescope lens and eventually it malfunctioned.  Considering that I decided I'd definitely stick with Nikon and try the AW100 so I can take it anywhere.  Here is what I've found:Pros:-Fairly small and compact.  Easy to whip out and take a picture.-Great selection of colors (although I recommend not getting camo if you plan on taking this into to woods for obvious reasons).-Although I have limited underwater use, the ones I did take looked pretty good.-Seems fairly durable so far.  Its taken a couple drops from four feet on a tennis court and held up (although video that had been recording is lost when it is dropped as the camera turns off).Cons:-Battery Life.  You need more than one battery especially on trips where you will be taking videos.-Charger.  You can't charge the battery in the camera.  This is a must for "all weather" cameras.  It at least should include a travel charger with a car charger or USB connection so you can charge it on the go.  With this camera all that's included is an external battery charger that requires an outlet.  This is a big downfall to this camera.-Images.  Although this camera takes some very good pictures, occasionally it will take ones out of focus. The same thing happened a couple times with videos.  Never had this happen with my previous Nikon S8100. I find I'm not as confident when I need to take a "must have" picture with this camera on the go.-Color. I got the Camo color because it was much cheaper on amazon than any of the other colors.  If you really plan to use this outdoors though, I'd get orange or blue but you will pay more.-Video.  Video is average to above average but the problem with it is when the camera falls the camera turns off and you lose all video you had been taking.  I took about a half hours worth of tennis video.  It took about a four foot fall and hit the court.  The camera itself was fine afterwards but it had turned off and the video was gone after the fall.  That was a bit disappointing.  Maybe I had too much confidence in its advertised "shock proofness" though. I did contact customer service to ask them if this was normal and they said after a 4 foot fall I would "have issues".  That's all they said.-Customer Service.  I really would have liked more than a short answer as to why an "all weather" camera does the above when its advertised as being "shock proof" but it is what it is.Overall: Decent camera but a step down for Nikon.  Image quality is a step down from regular cameras but that was to be expected as the lens in enclosed.  Randomly taking poor quality blurry pictures doesn't help my confidence though as I never had this happe with my previous Nikon's.  I haven't decided whether to take this one back or not.  I would take a good hard look at others before buying this one.  The battery charger is a huge issue as well with this camera for anybody that needs to charge on the run.  Good luck.
$SUMMARY.: Step down from other Nikons

$review_text.: I had tried several routers, thinking a different router would get me more power in my living room and bedroom - since the router is in my office and apparently my apartment has very thick walls. Anyhow, the various routers all performed exactly the same - and with the same results. But this little guy did the trick!! I got half-way through the set up and did something wrong, so I ended up having to call customer service at D-Link - they were terrific!! It took a while to figure out the problem, but they eventually did and now it works like a charm!! I have at least 3-4 bars throughout the house. I bought this one instead of other choices that might have been a little less expensive because my router is a D-Link and I figured it couldn't hurt to use the same brand - especially if I ended up having to call customer service. Don't know if that was true, but I'm satisfied - with the router, the extender, and the customer service experience!

$REVIEW.: This is a four foot cable that is well-suited to connect my iPod touch and portable speaker

 It fits both devices perfectly and is sturdy and well-made
 Because I use the pair in the car where they can be bounced around, it is important to me that the cable connecting them be more sturdy than the fragile cable that came with the speaker originally.Fits the devices perfectly, sturdy enough to stand up to my usage, who could ask more of a cable?  I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who uses a connecting cable.FIVE STARS!

$REVIEW.: Device worked as advertised, although I had problems with the buttons operating other than expected. Up volume would frequently close apps on my iPhone which meant I had to unlock the phone, open the app in question and manually restart whatever I was listening to. Doesn't sound like too big of a deal, but the purpose of the remote is to work remotely (originally had this remote mounted to the handlebars of a motorcycle to control my iPhone while riding).Buttons are of adequate size, would like to see a backlight for the device in darker conditions. Has a built-in keyboard but the buttons are so tiny and of use in the rarest of situations, few of those in a remote capacity.Does a job, just not the one I needed it for. Returned the device.

$review_text.: .The drive itself is a Western Digital Black
There are millions of them running right now all over the world
 Given half a chance (mostly meaning no shipping damage, and not overheated) these drives will run happily for years.As for it being an "Advanced Format" drive (AFD), I'm running Windows XP on two such drives
Western Digital provides a program that makes the needed adjustments (if any) to the drive, though oddly, you can only download the program after you register your warranty

The program itself is simple to run.The important thing here is that Amazon seems to have cleaned up the way it ships hard drives


 I've posted pictures of the shipment I received
The drive was contained in what appears to be a factory box, and that box was contained in another.Sadly, there was no packing material at all between the two boxes

 All shipped boxes are thrown around by carriers (if not by human handlers, then by the sorting machinery) and the lack of packing material here can actually amplify shock loads when the small box slides inside the larger

 Even a small amount of brown paper wadding here would make all the difference


 But still this is a huge improvement over Amazon's previous near-useless packing methods, so credit where it's due.Again sadly, it's not certain that every shipment is packed this way (or perhaps better, with packing materials between the two boxes)
 In the past different Amazon shipping points have used different packing methods, so unless Amazon makes an announcement we can only hope for the best.There are some general things to know about hard drives


 None of this is my personal opinion, it's all information I've gotten from the Western Digital and Seagate web sites:All hard drives are essentially silent
 Any intrusive noises, including loud clicks, and especially including any grinding noises, are guarantees of imminent failure.Hard drives have no noticeable vibration
 Put your hand on the metal casing (not the circuit board) and you can barely feel the disks spinning, and that's all be vibration there should ever be

 Anything more means, again, imminent failure.An occasional exception to the no-noise-no-vibration rule happens when the metal parts of the computer case vibrate, which can amplify sound the way a guitar top does

 But this is not common, and the general rule about hard drives is: you should never know it's running.Overheating is death to all electronics


 If you're at all geeky do a web search for a free program named Speccy, by piriform dot com
 Speccy requires no installation
Just 2click to run it, and it reports various internal temperatures
 Anything over 50 degrees Celsius is bad, and lower is better


 Check your fan(s), make sure air vents are clear, always ensure that there's a cooling airflow.As a matter of information, these are laptop drives but I have two and run them in my two desktops


 The data (small) and power (large) cable connectors are the same, they plug in with no alterations or adapters of any kind

 The connectors themselves automatically make the right connections.And finally, my opinion is don't hesitate to use Amazon's 30-day warranty

 Shipping damage seems to be the #1 cause of hard drive failures, so if you have any suspicion at all that you received a damaged drive, then I say back she goes..

$review_text.: Often when one refers to something as a classic, there is some performance trade off. Not the case here. This is THE tele macro of choice for Nikon users. It is so so sharp at macro/closeup shooting distances. The bokeh (out of focus area) is spectacularly smooth. This is not an AFS lens so the AF performance is neither quick nor silent as more modern designs deliver. Yet, know that this lens is really designed for close-up/macro work, so focusing speed is less of an issue. While some find it to be a serviceable medium tele (it is a fairly fast 200mm lens after all), I find it to be much more of a specialist's tool. Luckily, macro has become a specialty for me and this tool is phenomenal. A little longer than the phenomenal Sigma 150 and much more expensive as well, so if you are on a budget for a tele macro lens, do take a very very serious look at the Sigma. Highly recommended.
$review_summary.: A classic!

$review_text.: As an iPhone owner and having used similar screen protector on my iPhone I knew for sure this screen protector will work on my iPad. Without much hesitation I ordered one. It arrived in a weeks time. But my mail man bent the package and had pushed it inside my mail box. I was really worried when I saw the package laying twisted in my mail box. I got it out and left it on a table with some weight on it to straighten it out. Then next day I opened one of the six protector and was happy to see it in good condition. Applying to the iPad was not much difficult at all. It comes with two peel of masks one at top and one at the bottom. You can find many videos in YouTube on how to apply one. There were bubbles and I was able to push them out with ease using the card that comes along. The protector does tend to go over the boundaries ( not a perfect fit ) but it's not that bad. That's why it gets 4 starsPros:1. You get 6 protectors2. Each one comes in their own package along with a cleaning cloth and a card to rub off the bubbles.3. Easy to install4. Washable and reusableCons:1. Not a perfect 100% fit. But its not that bad too.

The sound quality is surprisingly good (I've tried it with the earbuds, which are so-so, and with over-the-ear Panasonic, Sony and Sennheiser headphones, with the latter two producing the best results for me);The only downside is that because the unit is &#34;super compact,&#34; so are the controls. My fat fingers haven't learned the switch locations yet, so I still have to take it out of my pocket and squint at it. That said, the controls feel solid rather than sloppy.So far so good.

$review_text.: I'm very disappointed with this lens.  The subject of every picture I took on my K10D with this lens was out of focus when shot on auto.  The focal point seemed to be 3m behind my subject.  None of my other lens have this problem. My DA* 50~135 consistently hits focus on the target and is ridiculously crisp.  I could manually focus on my subject and produce a reasonable image if the aperture was dialed down enough, but the point of this lens is the ultrasonic auto focus.  At 50mm f2.8 everything was very soft.  The image didn't start to sharpen up until f5.6.  When shooting at 16mm nothing was sharp.  The entire aperture range was blurry.  At any range there was a 5mm purple fringe on any high contrast object.  I have heard some people have gotten great copies of this lens.  This wasn't one of them.  For every great review of this lens I see, there are about 8 people complaining about it.  Pentax, this is unacceptable.  Think of your reputation!

$REVIEW.: Bought this about 2.5 months ago after learning my daughter's 3 y/o camera wouldn't power up, and the stock battery was all icky / leaking looking. I've never had a li-on battery get bad like this, but since I'm reviewing this replacement and not the original, it gets all 5 stars. As others have mentioned it is compatible with the info-lithium capabilities of some cameras which guesses at time remaining and not just a "fuel" gauge. Capacity seems fine and holds a charge as expected. Some reviewers report suspicion of getting a fake battery - I didn't notice any funny business with the battery or packaging, ordered from seller "AC365". When in doubt and the prices are close, just click on the XX New button and order direct from Amazon for best odds and easiest returns. An aside - the leaking battery (which was left in the charger, unplugged, for months at a time) messed up the charger and I replaced that with Sony BC-CSG OEM Battery Charger for NP-BG1, NP-FG1 battery with success.

$review_text.: The sound is very good, however the chord quality, especially where it meets the earbuds are very poor in quality.  The chord will get brittle in cold tempertures and eventually will crack, exposing the wire, and then break eventually.  Given the high price of Shure headphones, this is unacceptable.Good luck in trying to get Shure to listen to the customer complaints when describing the problem with their product.Furthermore, the inner ear plug, does not lock into position, and is easily lost.  Replacements are only available through Shure at a ridiculous high price (Something that is worth literally 10 cents in material is sold for 10 dollars.Good sound, but a faulty product design therefore ultimately a waste of money.

Believe it or not, everyone does not live in a McMansion with a dedicated media room.Got a good deal on a "refurbished" unit directly from Zvox via Amazon, appeared new. Setup was easy, though I had to go through the remote learning process three times before it took. Making sound adjustments are easy and straightforward. I found that the dialog has been made significantly better and I do not even use the dialog enhancement feature.I did a bass test using the movie Titan A.E., and I would say it held its own. Although, at times there is some bass distortion.  But keep in mind that I am not an audiophile. So far I have to say that I am very impressed by this speaker.***************************************************Update 4-2-2013Just bought a new, heavier TV, the bass distortion seems to have disappeared, so it was probably more of a TV vibration problem.  I read another review recently where someone else had the same problem and he placed a black towel between the TV base and the Zvox to eliminate the problem.

$review_text.: I bought this 5 months ago and haven't had an issue for the majority of that time. While it's true that the instructions are terrible, anyone with a slight familiarity with technology should be able to figure this camera out well enough. I played with the controls for about 10 minutes before I was certain I had everything down pat. I installed it in my car and was very happy with it up until about 4 months into owning itFEB 2014, I noticed that it was no longer turning itself on in the car and recording my daily commute. With the camera was still plugged into the charger, I just could not get it to turn on. I unplugged it from the charger and attempted to turn it on. It did power up only twice and even then it didn't make it past the splash screen.The problem appeared to be that it no longer holds a charge. I brought the unplugged camera inside to charge it on my personal USB charger I had for the wall; this was to determine if the charging issue was the car cable or my camera. Unfortunately it turns out that the camera doesn't hold the charge.I charged it all night on my personal USB charger and it only held a charge long enough to record ~2 minutes of video before the LCD screen began to flicker and the camera would lose power. Given the other reviews, I will attempt to work this out with the company and I will update my experiences here.EDIT: The seller is shipping me a new camera unit and does not require me to ship the defective one back. I was offered a brand new set up (camera, mount, charger, etc) for $10 but declined. I wasn't given an estimated time of arrival, but I will keep this post updated.EDIT: Camera arrived about 2 weeks after they agreed to send me a new one. It's installed in my car and so far things are going well. I will update this review if this unit fails again.EDIT: It's only a week later and my replacement camera has also stopped holding a charge. I ran it through the same tests that I did to my original one and produced the same results. Just spend your money elsewhere.
$SUMMARY.: First one went after 4 months; Replacement went in under a week

$review_text.: The Roku 2 XS is a superior producet, just as their last versions were.Much has been said about streaming devices, and the ability to cut the cable.  I am on the fence about that notion.  It really depends upon how much of a TV watcher you are.  I happen to love HBO True Blood, in particular, and it's event programming, and like to have access.That being said, the Roku 2 XS is a superior streaming device. I love the small footprint, and ease of use.  I have had earlier versions, and so have my elder parents --  so easy to set up, and simple to use.I use it for AMAZON Prime on-demand, Crackle, Pandora and HuluPlus most frequently.  There are many "stations" you can set up, some free, and many with a fee.One thing to mention-- you MUST have high speed internet to enjoy this product. I happen to have Xfinity, and it works like a charm.Another thing - sadly they do NOT include an HDMI cable, which may impact some who are hoping for out-of-the-box perfection- this is a KEY issue, and VERY IMPORTANT for those who may give this as a gift to anyone with a HD TV.  Though one could spend more, Amazon offers affordable high quality  HDMI cables via "Amazon Basics" , and so do other big box stores.Though not essential, add in a MicroSD card too, if you plan on using it for games.  The new remote offers Bluetooth connections for games and they do lag and sputter without the MicroSD card. If you dont plan on games, dont worry about this.To conclude:An excellent option if your TV lacks a a net-streaming function, easy to move around for a family, singles and college students, and very nice for seniors  they will say they dont want it, but will love it).Just be sure to get that HDMI cable if you have a HD TV.Hope this helps.

I've had the previous cordless/wireless Trackball and I can say it was the most 'flawless' mouse I've used for nearly 10 years. This updated version keeps everything in quality, updates the smoothness of the overall touch and enhances overall tracking too. The 'Forward/Reverse' buttons area a delightful add on. You simply will love this mouse compared the old drag-and-snag mice/mouse of the now by gone era = use less muscles to control your mouse... This beauty simply scrolls with ease and perfection; no jitter or delaying to the trackball input. Cheers!

$REVIEW.: This is a great product


The first one work so well that I bought a 2nd one for my laptop which only had &#34;b/g&#34;


This runs at 450 all of the time from anywhere in my home on the 2.8 MHz band

The first one is hooked up to my HTPC in the living room, and works great also
It is set to run on the 5.0 MHz band


They are very small and come with a detachable USB cable

Depending on the needs, you can configure them to run on either band, and that can be changed if needed.The only problem I found is that they do not work well with any USB extensions, and the cable that comes with it is only about 2 feet in length

OK for a laptop, but a little limiting for a HTPC where the receiver need to be in a more open location.I have 2 wireless &#34;N&#34; routers, (1 Dual Band) 2 wireless &#34;N&#34; card adapters, and now 2 Dual Band wireless &#34;N&#34; USB adapters, all from TrendNet and they all work great and offer a 3 year warranty.

$REVIEW.: I am using this IR extender with various remotes and am very happy with the performance.  But my road to satisfaction had a bump I can help you avoid.  I, like most folks, like to test things out to see if they work before I invest much time in installation.  Installation is minimal in this case, just running some wires and making room to plug the device in on a pretty full UPS, but I wanted to test it out none the less.  So I plugged everything in, moved the receiver around the corner, pointed the stylish blaster at the devices (an ATT Uverse box, TV and DVD player) and .... nothing happened.  Added a mini blaster and ... I got very erratic transmission.  Moved them closer, farther away ... still awful performance.  I could see the lights responding on the blaster.  I read the instructions again, which are very brief because the product is so simple, and still could not figure it out.So, I called Logitech support, got escalated a level and then got an answer to my blunder.  I am now appropriately humbled.  I was pointing the shinny rounded edge toward the electronics.  It is the side with the wires coming out that needs to be pointed in the general direction of the devices to be controlled.  It makes total sense for when you install the blasters.  They were designed to sit on a shelf slightly in front of any equipment with their wires extending toward the back of the shelf.  But, when I was testing from in front of the equipment, I did not think to turn the blaster around so the side with all of the wires attached was pointing at the electronics.Once over this bump in the road I created, the product worked well with all of my remotes.  Of note, the IR receiver - the only part that sits out in the open - has a cord that is 8 feet in length and ends in what looks just like a 3.5mm audio jack.  That should cover most applications.  However, if additional length is needed, a headphone cord extender would fit - I just do not know of the signal would travel the additional length.
$SUMMARY.: Very effective.  Some advice for testing during setup.

$review_text.: My family has two Nikon DSLRs -- a D5100 and a D60. On a recent trip to Italy, we lost one of our lens caps (Nikon LC-52 Snap on Front Lens Cap). In general, we knew this was going to happen eventually since we first bought a DSLR; it's actually a bit surprising we made it this far and only lost one.After I purchased a replacement lens cap, I Googled for a solution to the lens cap problem. We're the type who will put the lens cap onto the lens as soon as we're done taking the shot we want, so putting the lens cap back in our bag was not an option, and I'm personally not a fan of them dangling around the camera with a string. So I stumbled upon this lens cap buckle and the concept seemed interesting to me. It took me a while to figure out how to thread it onto my stock camera strap (yep, I even look like a tourist when taking shots in my own city), but once I got it on, I was surprised that it stayed put without moving up and down easily. The lens cap fits onto it just as easily as it does onto the camera lens -- just squeeze the sides and push in.My only gripe about it so far is that it's always on the same spot on my strap. When my shoulder gets tired I sometimes switch which side I put my camera on, and as a result the buckle will end up on my back instead. I can't deduct a star for this though, since I can't think of a solution to that.Overall it's a very good product, it holds the lens cap very snugly and I'm no longer afraid of losing another lens cap. Just make sure you choose the correct size.

$review_text.: The Garmin Nuvi 285 is a bargain. Amazon lists it at about $135 today. I received it a little over 1 month ago and I believe it was $25 higher, but also a bargain. I drove 3500 miles on vacation the last 3 weeks and used the Garmin almost all of the time.. The Garmin was easy to use with rapid start and programming. A couple of times it took what I consider a bad route, but all you have to do is drive what you think is better and it will rapidly recalculate and keep you on track. The recalculation is even more valuable if you get lost as the recalculation feature combined with a destination will probably get you back on path rapidly.The display was quite good, the information very helpful. You can find out the route in advance with a push on the screen. Estimated time of arrival is listed and revised after a pit stop. I have some problem seeing my car speedometer in some lighting situation, but the gps guided speedometer on the Garmin is great. You want to go home? Click on home. It remembers quite a few recent destinations as well. Points of interest including motel, service stations and restaurants are easily available.The audio voice is pleasant. Like other GPS you are told to turn right or keft, but this Garmin tells you the name of the street for which you are making the turn.I did not use the blue tooth feature as my car already has built in blue tooth.My prior car had a navigation system with a larger map, but was less convenient and required taking your eyes way off the road to see the screen, which was too low in position.  I used a friction-bean bag mount for the Garmin and placed it near my line of sight immediately below the front window line. It is very easy to glance at without departing the road. I find it much more useable than the $2000 built in nav system I used in the past.In conclusion, the Garmin 285 is a bargain and functions extremely well. Spring for a friction-bean bag mount for best placement.

You're not going to get amazing sound out of these, but they're loud and clear enough where it justifies the purchase. I like how you can roll the extra cord in the back of the speaker so you don't have cables lying around your desk. I do wish they came with a volume knob, but it's not a deal breaker. I bought this refurbished from Amazon for $16 shipped, and for that price, it's fantastic.

The feature that sealed the deal for me was the line in recording and it works great.I have a small library of cassette tape sets of self-help and financial gurus (Nightingale, Gerber, etc.).  I know that recording/digitizing these tracks through my PC's sound card is possible, but the Zen is a very simple alternative.The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that it requires the Zen software to be installed on the PC to browse the contents.  This is probably because the unit is capable of synchronizing Outlook contacts.  Same thing with my Axim PDA.  Not a big deal at all though.Sounds good, sized and priced right. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Let me start by saying this lens focuses quickly and accurately and the image stabilization works extremely well. Pictures are sharp and contrast is beautiful.To answer the criticisms of this lens that I have seen,1. Do you actually own it?2. It's not an "L" series lens and has never been advertised as such. Thus, it is not weather sealed. Then again, none of the EF-S cameras are weather sealed either.3. This is the fastest, sharpest, and most hand holdable of the f2.8 lenses in canon's lineup right now. If you look at the results on Photozone.com, the 17-55 IS F2.8 is sharper than canon's famous EF 24-70 F2.8L.4. EF-S should be around long enough for you to take some great pictures with this lens. If you're not satisfied with 1.6X crop factor you can always sell your lens on E-Bay for almost the price you paid for it.In conclusion, this is the best all around lens for the EF-S mount canon cameras available at this time. Go get it and start taking pictures.

$REVIEW.: Bought this on Amazon and had it installed a couple of weeks now. This is my first bluray player. I figured the price couldn't be beat. One of the first things I did was connect it to my wireless, then it prompted me for a firmware update - which I did and went smoothly. It then played a couple 3D documentaries and one 3D movie. Very enjoyable 3D experience and exceptional clarity on a normal 3D movie. Unit is very compact, light, very quiet, movies loaded in a few seconds, and wireless experience is very good with great clarity on a 5MB internet connection.Then there was this one time I loaded a previously played 3D documentary to show some cousins the 3D experience - and it gave me the dreaded "Cannot play this disc" error. I loaded it about 3 times - which it then played. After that, we watched half of another BD movie. The next day, it then refused to play ANY disc (DVD or BD)!!!!  It would say LOAD for about a minute or more, the disc would spin and stop about three times - and then the error pops up. All the discs I tried are spotless. I tried a $30 (CleanDr) disc about 3-4 times - and that would not go through the menu properly. I also tried shooting some compressed air in. Eventually, it would then only play the two 3D documentary discs that I have, but NOTHING else. I inserted a USB flash drive (1GB) inserted on the back - since Sony online says some players need to have one inserted. I tried all the other troubleshooting techniques on the Sony support page.  I'm taking it to a local electronics repair tech to see if he can do anything with it. Since I brought this to my country from my brother's in Florida, I have no way to return it.I am very disappointed about this!!!

Thought this review may help a mac user considering purchase.The advanced power settings require windows to setup, but I did this through Parallels, and it works great. When I'm done at night, and power down the computer, all of my (now inactive) peripherals that are plugged into the managed plug are powered down to save power. I know it's about 15 watts it's saving me thanks to the great LCD display on the device. Not much, but it all adds up. Again... to take advantage of certain advanced settings you need Windows.It'd be great if APC made a Mac version of the management software, but if you can use a PC, parallels, vmware, etc... (even borrow a buddy's temporarily for the setup) you'll be good to go with the advanced power management settings. But even without using Windows the basics work great... When I plugin in the provided USB cable to my mac, the battery level, remaining time and power source show up at the top of the menu bar on Lion and Mountain Lion (may also work with previous versions of Mac OS X - you'll have to look). Also, in System Preferences additional options show up on how to handle a power outage. These are built in to the OS and work perfectly with the APC BR1000G UPS.One of these keeps my DSL modem, my Airport Extreme base station, some external hard drives, and a Mac mini I use as a fileserver and iTunes server running. It'll run for quite a while too. So... since the router and Wi-Fi access point have power backup, the internet keeps running though a power outage! Very nice... since ipads, laptops, kindles, etc have their own batteries (gives you something to do while the power is out) but it's especially nice for minimal downtime for those momentary power outages.For home or business use it doesn't take much time wasted with power outages to justify this purchase - especially if you have irregular power service. I highly recommend this product.

$REVIEW.: The unit is smaller than I thought it would be.  It sounds great for its size.  I have only used it with an iPod and have not setup the wireless yet.  One thing that I don't like is the fact of having to turn the volume knob six full revolutions to turn from all the way down to all the way up.  There are 100 volume settings,this is a little much. A disc with a PDF file would be great instead of having to go out to the website for features and instructions.

I had no issues installing the drivers that came with the card. I am using the drivers that came with the card on a Windows 8 64 bit system. I was a little worried that I may not get a USB 3 card to work in my system, but this is doing a fine job so far. I think this card has an NEC USB 3.0 chip on it, which I heard were more reliable than others. Worth the money!

$review_text.: This tablet is an all around excellent Tablet. I've owned the original 7 in tab which was nice but too expensive and slightly under performing compared to this tablet. I also own the Toshiba 10 inch tablet and the Samsung 7 inch Tab 2 which are OK but really are not in  the same league. This tablet outperforms these other tablets in just about every way. The other tablets had either short battery life, were too slow or not as responsive as the Tab2 10 inch.This tablet is very sharp, easy to read, very responsive and the battery life is spectacular compared to the other tablets I use. Is this good enough to replace a notebook or laptop? I don't think so. I've seen tablets used in very creative and productive ways but it can't replace my desktop or laptop. I find even my old very slow net book will outperform this tablet and any other Tablet (surface excluded). This tablet is just a great electronic toy that is also very useful for web surfing, video, displaying camera images, and a 1000 other uses. I think most purchases of a tablet will use it as a very portable computer which it is but not their sole computer. There are so many application for its use most of which I haven't discovered yet.The best thing about this tablet is it works almost as well as the very best tablet out there but is now very reasonably priced. Why spend $500 or more for a tablet that will be replaced in 2 years. I mention this period because the batteries are not user serviceable and it's life is unknown (probably 2-3 years)The tablets available in the next few years may match laptop power of today, who knows.Overall I like the Tablet a lot. I use it along with my Kindle for reading, Pandora, driving a creative stereo speaker via Bluetooth, checking email, a few games, Amazon, and Netflix, and viewing my cameras digital images which works out great in the field. I could use it more but I like using my big 17 laptop with 17 core, 8 GB memory, Windows 7 and big solid state drive. It boots much faster than the tablet between 5 and 15 seconds. If you are tired of long boot times on your computer try a SSD, you will be pleasantly surprised.If you love Apple products, you may not like this Android device, however if you have any Android phone, I feel confident you will probably really like and be glad you bought this tablet. I bought a Bear motion leather cover (excellent) that acts as a stand and the tablet can be used vertically or horizontally and protect the tablet from damage. Overall The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10 inch Tablet is a great tablet at a reasonable price and you won't regret the purchase.

I'm able to stream VUDU and Netfix with no problems. I already had a lower version of the Samsung hooked up with an Ethernet cable, so this one (put in my bedroom) I needed the wi-fi capability.

$review_text.: I decided to get this case because of all the glowing reviews here on amazon
Yes, the price is right and you get a free screen cover which are both nice but the grooves that allow you to prop up the pad are too short


My iPad 3 slips off them all the time

It's very annoying! I have also tried theTargus Versavu for the New iPad (3rd Gen)and really like it a lot! It has deep grooves which never slip and a rotating design that lets you change the viewing positions between landscape and portrait which is a nice feature! The on/off mag feature does not work correctly on any cover that I have tried so far
It's always hit and miss


We alway turn the pad off with the switch just to be sure
I think the extra 15 bucks for the Targus is money well spent


But this case is an OK alternative especially if you still need a screen protector.

$review_text.: This seems to be a great value. 8GB with 266x speed for a fraction of the price of other cards with this rating. But be aware that this is the read speed. So I've put it to the test. Reading at roughly 40MB/s it holds up to the specs but writing is poor: about 18MB/s. Which means you get less than 133x CF specification. You can get the Kingston 133x for about the same price. The only advantage over this would be that you can download your photos to your PC faster. So it always proves true that you get what you pay for. I don't want to say that it's a bad value but you won't empty out the cache of your DSLR as fast as with a SanDisk Extreme 40MB/s for example.

$REVIEW.: Although this looks like a CRV3 battery in the picture and turns up on an Amazon search for rechargeable CRV3 battery it is NOT a CRV3.  While it fits in a CRV3 camera and charger (barely) the terminals are not the same and it will not work.  I can't imagine why Kodak would create a proprietary battery type that is so similar to a standard battery to ensure confusion.  My mistake though - it doesn't actually say it is a CRV3 in the description.  But you just sort of figure that camera companies have a bit of common sense and make their proprietary battery packs distinctive from common battery types.

$REVIEW.: I would have given this item 4 stars, other than it is hard to install in my HP laptop. If you try to push it into the slot with your finger, it will not go in far enough to latch, and simply pops back out. You need to take just your fingernail and push the card in until it clicks. It probably needs to go an eighth of and inch past the edge of the laptop to get it to latch. Getting it out is difficult as well, since again you need to use your fingernail to push the card in until it clicks and pops out. I don't know if this is something peculiar to my HP laptop, or if all HP's are like this.On the plus side, once installed you can just leave it installed, since it doesn't project beyond the edge of the laptop at all!

They even send it in a beautiful brown gift bag - a nice extra touch if you're thinking of giving it to someone for a gift.It's beautiful, high quality leather with a vintage feel and look to it.The iPad fits perfectly and snugly and the on/off feature (close the case - device off - open the case - device on) works exactly as advertised.I couldn't decide between this or the curve model, but I love the laces on the binding and the more vintage look.If you're wondering about the quality and look of this case - wonder no more.  I'm a tough (but fair) critic and you're going to love this case.

$review_text.: I was sent this Seagate 2Tb USB External Hard Drive by Amazon Vine for an honest review

Here's my take on it.I was looking for a larger external drive to replace an older one and this is exactly what I needed

With its 2 Tb size, I can store all my husband's wildlife photos, documents and music without hogging valuable laptop space.It's truly plug and play

As soon as I connected it, the software downloaded in seconds and it was ready for use


Copying (drag and drop, actually) 6.7 Gb of RAW images took a bit longer-7 minutes


Still, I couldn't complain.It is compact and extremely quiet


The additional plug in my power strip wasn't a problem, especially since I switched out an older drive.The laptop is a Windows 7 x 64 machine with the faster USB interface and the file transfers worked without a hitch
Although I use an online file backup, I feel better having the photos, documents and email address lists stored in a handy external drive.

Removing the quick access door reveals a circuit board rather than the drive bay.  You need to remove the circuit board from the other side of the case in order to change the drive out.  WHY???The cable is totally custom, splitting the mini-USB into two pieces.  Other vendors use a standard USB cable.  I have no idea why they did this.To me this is scrap.The vendor shipped quickly and it was packaged well.  I have no issues with the re-seller.

When I copied the my program onto the DVD for backup purposes, I had difficulty recopying it back to my computer; it wouldn't do it reliably and frequently crashed.2.) When I tried to rewrite over an old program (i.e


update the same program but with new information) on the DVD it wouldn't (although it asked me if I wanted to and I said yes)


So I had to erase the entire DVD before I tried to copy a new file on the DVD disc.3.) After I erased the DVD, that disc would not accept a new file being copied to it; the EZ-Dub kept asking me to put a disc in the drive, although there was one already there.(the one I just erased)I ended up taking this unit back as I could not seem to get a consistent working response from this machine.

$REVIEW.: I ordered these so that I could hang a projector screen in front of my Plasma tv for the occasional big screen viewing.I use this for an 82 inch screen.  The bracket does extend for 6 inches, and is very sturdy.  However, the section that screws to the wall is almost 6 inches as well - so in my case, it extends longer than my crown molding at my ceiling.I am only using 1 screw (not three) for each bracket - it works fine.Overall it is a high quality product that I would recommend it you have to extend your screen away from a wall.
$SUMMARY.: Works as intended - but the picture is not 100% accurate.

$REVIEW.: I haven't had a mechanical keyboard since I was fifteen years old. I had been using chiclet styled keyboards on macs since college, and about a year ago I decided it was time to get something that would ease up all the typing I have to do (software development). I chose the cherry blue switches as they are regarding for typing and I love the tactileness and responsiveness. I game, too, and have no problems using this keyboard, either. The keyboard looks really sleek, too, and avoid the future issue of letters rubbing off after repeated usage as the markers are listed below the keys and available to the user at an angle. All this said, unless you need your keyboard to glow, I'd go with this one. I started my hunt with the DAS keyboards, but those don't seem to hold up to what they used to be (unless you buy refurbished editions) but these coolermaster keyboards feel solid.
$SUMMARY.: Man do I love this keyboard

$review_text.: I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSCS40 as a replacement for my Sony 2MP CyberShot - which was a workhorse of a camera! The original CyberShot was much smaller and didn't have any zoom capability - but I would have purchased that camera over DSCS40.* Size - the DSCS40 is larger than previous CyberShots - I am assuming to house the zoom lens.* Battery Life - pretty good - even when using a flash* Shutter speed - I disagree with most of the reviews here - If you are outside with sunlight this is a great camera with good shutter speed


If you are inside and the flash is needed, you are going to be waiting 3 seconds for the camera to focus


Once the flash goes off, start counting to 5 before you can take another picture


If your subject moves, add another 3 secoonds to refocus
Again, my old 2MP CyberShot performed better...* VISIBAL LASER BEAM - No one else wrote about this


This is the first digital camera I've seen that has a visial laser that shoots out to determine lighting and the focus
Pointing lasers at people's eyes is always a bad idea


The camera's manual says that the laser is "safe" but it recommends not aiming at people's eyes (interesting)

If you have children, do not buy this camera because this laser is not a good idea


My previsous CyberShot and most other digital cameras (high and low cost) do not have this visial laser - why this camera does I'll never know.* Zoom lense - nice feature to have - glad its there
However, if you use the zoom, you have to be extra stable before taking the picture or it will result in a blurry picture.* Picture Stability - The camera has no automatic picture stabilization - make sure you are solid before taking the picture - I have many shots that I deleted because I moved just alittle bit


This occurs even when not using the zoom.* Memory - I've gone with the 3MP setting because the aspect ratio matches a 4x6 photo.* Flash - As stated above, it takes 5 seconds to recharge

Also, using the flash usually maeans the color will be whited-out (i.e., not great quality).* Picture Quality - Excellent when the lighting is good* Video - I haven't used it much - I pull out the digital video camera for that.* Price - Average camera for the price - This is a much better camera when outside in good lighting

However, it gets 2 stars because I expect more from Sony and for the price, there were better digital cameras I could have purchased.* Summary - My previous 2MP Cybershot left me with a great opinion of Sony's cameras
The DSCS40 Cybershot has damaged that reputation


I will definitely check Sony out for my next camera, but the usually reliable Amazon reviews really missed the boat on this one


People giving this 4-5 stars must have had really bad experiences with previous cameras to give the DSCS40 such a high rating
I don't know else how to explain it


I will be sure to test the camera and not just go off of reviews before purchasing in the future.

$review_text.: Great item for the price
I saw no difference between this and the OEM item.The OEM item is something like $50-$80 to replace which makes no sense - and it still died after a year

I have had this one for a month without any issues - if it does not last the next 5 months I'll take off one star.Review update (5/24/2014):The original review was written on Nov 2013 - I left it unchanged on top
We started using the adapter on 10/25/2013
On 5/15/2014 the adapter died


The annoying thing was that the little green LED was still on even though no power made it to the laptop


$9.5 for 7 months of use - I say still a great value


I was going to take a star off - but it did last for more than 5 months.I am really impressed by the amount of engineering that went into the product - good enough to work for at least one month, yet still die within a year to ensure repeat business
Those guys are really good at what they do.Anyway, got a similar adapter for $8 from Amazon, it came after two days

Laptop as happy as ever.

$REVIEW.: I've only owned an iPod nano, and have never been able to hold all of my music. I am quite pleased that I purchased this classic iPod instead of the touch. It has a lot more gbs, and is not as expensive. I already have an iPhone, so I didn't see a need for it. I just wanted more music space. The overall design is the same as it's always been, but I like the fact that the front is a matte black - the back is a shiny silver, with the standard apple logo. I recommend this item if you have a huge music library over the touch.

$review_text.: I expected this Nuvi generation to be a lot more intuitive than it is.  I am a relatively high-tech user, and find the logic and screens too confusing to change some settings while driving, even after owning it for several months.  Most features technically work as described, but not always the way you expect.  I gave this 2 stars because I expected to be really impressed. I'm thinking of giving this unit to one of my children, who have lesser requirements GPS-wise.The audio quality of the bluetooth handsfree is so poor I don't use that feature.  Before I stopped using the handsfree, the unit would sometimes automatically connect with my Treo phone, but sometimes it wouldn't, so I had to check it every time I got in the car.Another problem is that the volume control is for the entire unit.  You can't turn off the speaker for the GPS function separately from the phone.  If you have turned off the GPS "voice" and are getting directions visually off the screen, when a call comes in, you have to turn the volume back up on the speaker to use the phone handsfree.  If you forget, the person on the other end can hear you, but you can't hear them.The screen is very bright.  I find myself having to adjust it to the prevailing light conditions as they change.  The screen seems to reset to the defaults each time it's turned on.This is my second GPS, the first was a Streetpilot i3. All GPS units are only as good as the maps and logic. From the reviews I've read, Garmin is supposed to have the best maps and logic.  If this is the best,  I don't need to try the rest.  In congested areas like the Northeast US, Garmin's logic only takes you the fastest route about 50% of the time, because places like NY, NJ and CT always have unpredictable traffic.  I haven't seen how this works when you have the optional FM traffic receiver, but that would depend on how good the traffic info is.New construction can take more than 2 years to show up on Garmin's maps, but it may be just as bad for the other GPS companies. I've driven the entire east coast of the US in the last year using my older Garmin GPS, with the latest updates, which cost $75. On Garmin's maps, some Washington DC beltway construction and the Ravenel Bridge in Charleston SC (opened July 2005) confuse the unit.They give you a cute slipcase for the GPS, but nothing for the suction mount & cable, so if you are traveling you need another case or bag.  I would have preferred one case with two pockets.One feature I will look for on my next GPS is the ability to pre-program and save specific routes, and have the GPS guide you.  This would be useful when you want to take an alternate route that parallels the route the GPS logic would take (say, a parkway), and then use the GPS for local roads at the end of the trip.

$review_text.: I purchased this to use the eSata interface on my external drives from Seagate.  When I started to notice some issues with my MacBook Pro with respect to accessing the drive and file permissions, there was a small note at the bottom of the Sonnet web site stating that there were driver issues with OS X and that the next release should remedy them.A couple months later, the site was updated to state that there is a known incompatibility with a certain Oxford Semiconductor chipset used by Seagate and Western Digital.  It is odd that this card has issues with the #1 and #2 makers of drives.I am not saying it's Sonnet's fault, but you will be SOL if you're using those FreeAgent Pro or MyBook drives.

$REVIEW.: Presentation/Packaging:First, these things are beautiful - from their packaging (which is large yet surprisingly minimal) to their actual craftsmanship
 I describe the packaging as "minimal" because, though large only includes the headphones themselves (which rest on a faux-silk/polyester-esque material covering a plastic housing) and, underneath the headphones, only two cables (one ten foot, one three), a zippered carrying pouch and a small pamphlet

Even with the list prices these have, no case is provided to store/protect these (a shortcoming/flaw in this reviewer's opinion).Size/Comfort:Second, the size of these is massive

 I mean massive

 My wife actually laughed when she saw them on my head

 Not only is my head large (a size 8 hat), but the headphones themselves are extremely large - much like wearing those large, 26 oz
cans of canned tomatoes on your ears

 Each earpiece is so large and heavy that, on my set anyway, holding the headphones by the top of the headband would cause the cans to slide down about an inch from where they expand/adjust to fit your head


 This also results in them being uncomfortable after a period of time; you feel their heft, their weight just pulling down on your head and neck

 The minimal padding on the headband does not alleviate this

 While the ear pads are soft and comfortable, they are almost too much so
 I found that mine were significantly molded to the shape they attained by resting in their box (flat on one side)
 On a plus side, the cups/pads are large enough to completely cover your ears, but those with small ears will probably find them too large.On the topic of their size, the ten foot cable is huge

 It is thick, it is heavy, it is dual-sided, it is covered in a rough material much like that of some of the older HDMI cables

 The plug which plugs into each ear piece is also so large that you will feel it bump against the tops of your shoulders at times (when you move in certain ways, etc.)

 That ten foot cable also adds even more weight to these, causing them to be even more uncomfortable, particularly at the very top of the headband resting on the top of your head


 Although Denon provides what they call an "on-the-go" three foot cable, such a notion fails in practice - practically speaking, these are far too large to carry "on-the-go." They don't even collapse at all, making the prospect of carrying these around while traveling even more of an effort.Build:As mentioned earlier, these are well made, but mostly plastic
 The padding, also as mentioned above, is soft enough to the point of being too soft

 Even the soft headband might be thick enough to provide comfort were the ear pieces themselves smaller, with less weight, but these particular cans are so heavy (even excluding the weight of the 10-foot cable), that they just pull down and cause the padding on the headband to compress so much it becomes uncomfortable


 But they do seem well built and as if they would last for some time to come (especially since they're so large you'll likely be unable to take them anywhere outside of your house).Sound:Amazing
 Truly a luscious, beautiful sound stage
 From lows, to highs, to mids, all separated nicely, all present, all very natural
 While not a "monitor" type of headphone, it is not overly enhanced
 All genres of music (jazz, blues, rock, classical, pop, soul) sounded excellent

 I loved the sound of these, but the rest of the shortcomings (at least for me) simply didn't justify keeping these, despite their great sound.Price:Lastly, at the time of this review, these headphones are apparently being discontinued and/or being replaced with a newer model

 As a result, my local Best B** had these on clearance for $149.99

 This prompted my immediate purchase of them

 That price is an absolute steal


 Nevertheless, despite being such an incredible value, the other issues listed above could not justify my keeping them and they have been returned

 Point being, if you're interested in picking these up, you'd do well to see if you can first find them at your local BB.In short:All in all, great sounding, well-made headphones, but with too many other flaws (for me) that just prevent them from being keepers

 At the price point offered here, they are vastly overpriced and not worth it

I couldn't even justify keeping them for the $149.99 that I paid.

$REVIEW.: I was very impressed with how quick and easy this was to set up.  Being USB, I just plugged the N600 into my computer, ran the setup/drive cd for the driver, and it immediately connected to my wireless router.  Because my PC sits on the floor beside my desk, I decided to use the included USB extension cable so that I could mount the N600 higher on the wall for a better signal.  I am in the next room to my centralized Wireless-N dual band router, with only one wall in between, and I am constantly connected at 300Mbps on the 5.0 GHz band (802.11a/n) with an 'excellent' strength signal.  I haven't had any drops either, even with online gaming.  The 2.4GHz band (802.11 b/g/n) works just as well, but the 5.0Ghz band is less used in my area and is said to be better for gaming and streaming movies.The configuration software that comes with the N600 is on a mini-cd. It contains the driver and the interface software.  The interface software has a nice clean look that's easy to use to connect to the different bands on a dual band router.  The N600 can connect to either the 2.4GHz band or the 5.0GHz band, but not simultaneously.  The software makes switching very easy, however it does not retain passwords so it's a bit of a pain to have to keep typing your password if you switch bands frequently.  The software will retain your password through computer shutdowns and reboots, provided you remain on the same band.I was so impressed that I purchased a second N600 for a different computer in a back bedroom.  This setup was just as simple, however this computer has a few more walls between it and the router, and has a lower quality signal on the 5.0GHz band.  This computer does a better job connecting with the N600 on the 2.4GHz band (5.0GHz doesn't penetrate walls as well as the 2.4GHz, and has a lesser range).  In truth, I can't say if this is the N600 adapter or the wireless router, or a bit of both.In conclusion: the N600 wireless adapter works great, is easy to set up, connects well, and I would recommend it as a great alternative to an internal NIC.

$review_text.: Received the item in early July, and it works well so far. It is, of course, pretty zippy in a USB 3.0 port, but even in 2.0 and 1.1 ports it is faster than others. My aunt noticed it, and said she wants one now, and her computer isn't even USB 3.0! It has been through the wash once, which may impress some, but most of the flash drives I own have been at some point, and all survived.For specifics in terms of speed, in real world usage I have seen read speeds around 130MB/s and write at around 40MB. These, of course, are peak speeds: unfortunately, when transferring, the speed will start maybe 20% under those speeds, get up to them, peak, and drop off. Still, the drive is extremely fast, and the fact that it can be hard to measure real world speeds because the file finishes transferring too fast should give you an idea of how this drive does.There are a couple of cons. First, as mentioned elsewhere, is the lack of indicator light. Also, even after 5 or 10 minutes of use, the drive gets quite warm. Neither of these issues are very concerning to me, but might be problematic for others and are therefore worth mentioning. All in all, this is a good, but not excellent flash drive.

$REVIEW.: This product is a great concept: Turn any camera into a wi-fi enabled photo uploader. In practice, it is not so good. The setup is complicated, the Eye-Fi tool on my Mac kept having major issues accessing the card when attempting to update the wi-fi networks, and the iOS app is a huge pain. In order to transfer photos to your iPhone/iPad, you need to mess with the iOS wi-fi settings and connect to an Eye-Fi &#34;direct network&#34; connection. For some reason, if both devices are set to connect to the same home wi-fi network, you can't seem to transfer photos to your device. You are also unable to set the card to share photos with more than one device. I had to choose to either sync with my Macbook or my iPhone, not both.This product was returned. If you need to transfer photos wirelessly, I would recommend purchasing a digital camera with the functionality built in.

$review_text.: The Good:I've had one of these for years (5??).  Anyway, it still works perfectly.  The best thing about this is that it can "learn" any function from another remote.  So even if you can't find the device code for your piece of equipment you can simply grab the remote for that device and map the keys to the Remote Commander even if the device labels don't match.  Or if you do find the code, but there are certain features that original remote has that aren't working on the Remote Commander you can assign and "learn" keys on Remote Commander.  For example: I mapped all my Roku streamer remotes' functions to "CD" on the Remote Commander since I don't own a CD player. Roku didn't even exist when the Remote Commander was designed.  The Remote Commander doesn't care it just knows send out the code it learned for that key.  It's also noteworthy that nearly EVERY key on the Commander can be "mapped/learned".  The touch screen areas and every "real" key you see in the picture can have a function assigned to it.  The think the only ones that can't be programmed are the device switch keys (TV, AMP, DVD, etc...) , power on/off, timer and light key.It also can do macro commands so you can program a key to turn on/off all your devices with one press, switch everything to a watch DVD, etc...very handy once you get it programmed.  It's made it a lot easier for my girlfriend to watch TV at my house.  She knows if she presses Function Key 1 it will turn on the TV and set everything for her to watch the DISH.  Simple.Finally, it has a very powerful IR transmitter.  With fresh batteries I don't even have to point it at the entertainment center and it still works.The Bad:It takes four alkaline AA batteries.  They've been lasting about three months a set for me.  I watch TV about 1-2 hours a night on average.  I think someone that watches more or has a family might go through batteries fairly quickly.Programming the Commander is not simple.  You really need to have the manual.  It's on the internet if you lose the printed copy.  I didn't have any real problems, but I'm a tech guy so this stuff is easy for me.The writing on the touch screen keys is pretty small.  If you have bad eyes you might have problems.Last, only the touch screen has back lighting.  The device keys (TV, AMP, DVD, etc...) and function keys are not lit.  Although the device keys are made with glow in the dark plastic I have found this is not sufficient.Bottom line:This very flexible universal remote.  It's a bargain at less than $100.  If you need something simple to program, with big keys and with better lighting you might want to look at some other solutions like Harmony.  Of course, you'll probably pay a lot more.

$review_text.: I was not sure I'd have any use for the Monster Mobile PowerCard Portable Battery, after all I have chargers for my iPhone.  However it turned out to be a cool little gadget.  The one I got is a cool metallic red color.  While it is about the size of a credit card the thickness is a little more than a USB plug - since a USB plugs into it.  So while they say you could carry it in your wallet that's not really true I don't think.  However it is small and light and easily will fit in your pocket.  You charge it via a mini USB plug and it comes with a short cord but you will need your own USB plug for the wall outlet.  I've used it with an iPhone 5 and it seems to be good to inject about 75% power into my phone.  It's kind of cool to have portable power as an option.  I could see it being very handy on a trip or an emergency but it's cool at home too as you can charge your phone and keep it with you or close by at the same time.  So it turned out to be a cool device I'd recommend to someone.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a simple, basic sound system to complement my new Samsung 55UNB8500 LED television.  We didn't want or need a full surround sound system, we didn't want to spend money on a separate receiver, and we didn't want to run wires all over our family room.That said, Bose's Cinemate Series II system fit our needs precisely.  The sound is rich and noticeably superior to the relevant alternatives that I considered (e.g., various "sound bars"). The system is also really easy to install.My only gripe about this product is the price.  $600 is a lot to pay for such a basic system -- and as nice as the system is, I'm not convinced that it's really worth $600 to most consumers.  We rationalized paying the price, because I'd just negotiated a really good price on our new TV, and when we applied that savings to the cost of the Cinemate sound system, we were still under budget for our total "TV setup."  Frankly, we were also getting tired of looking for alternatives.  But, standing alone, and given how basic the system is, I think the system is overpriced by $100-ish.

I tested this cable against 3 other Cat5 cables we have in our office and there was absolutely no difference whatsoever - same response time when they were all connected to the same Apple Airport Extreme router.**UPDATE**: amended my review to 5 stars:Apparently, Cat 6 is suitable for 10 Gigabit Ethernet and Cat 7 is suitable for 40 Gigabit Ethernet, provided the host network supports it.

$REVIEW.: I chose to give these a shot for two reasons. First, the Amazon reviews were very positive. Second, I have used Kingston memory in past and have always been pleased. When I upgraded my MacBook Pro to Lion, I was faced with a much slower machine. Fusion was causing the system to slow down even further. Programs like IPhoto and ITunes were crawling.The memory arrived packaged well. It took me 5 minutes to install and now I am working like the old days. Its too bad that it took 8 GB RAM to make my computer work right again but I am happy. Oh, by the way, I originally visited the Apple Store where I was prepared to pay $400 for the memory upgrade. Instead, they gave me attitude saying that they only supported new computers in the store, not a 2009 MacBook! I thank the dude with attitude, he saved me $350!

I still will end up buying spare Nikon Batteries but this was a great money and time saver since they were half the price, but they do only provide half the power...If they start to have low performance I will update, or if I can do a test to demonstrate how man shots I can get out of both of them I will and post that information as well.

$REVIEW.: I own a MacBook Pro purchased in May 2010.  This version of MBP supports audio output through the Mini A/V output.  The product came quickly and in packaging that is clearly new.  As described, this is not an 'official' Apple product, but it has the same quality fit and finish as the Apple version (minor difference in HDMI side shape - but is cosmetic only).Setting up the Audio and Visual output on the MBP was mostly instant for me.  I say "mostly" because it took a quick tutorial through the MBP's "?" function to see exactly what to change in System Preferences to get the audio to pass through to my HD TV correctly.  A less-experienced MBP user might find it difficult to set this up, but most would figure it out after some trial and error once the Apple Online instructions are followed.  Don't let this scare you from the product.  It is an excellent value and is so handy that I consider it a MBP Must-Have.As for folks who have MBP's from before early 2010, the audio may not transmit through the HDMI due to a difference in the DisplayPort hardware.  It is easy to check if your MBP has the capability to do so:  Go to your System Profiler (inside the Applications folder, then inside the Utilities folder) - The icon looks like a caliper over a microchip.  A small window will open with a list of Hardware options on your computer.  Select "Audio (Built In)".  If your computer has "HDMI / DisplayPort Output" or anything of that nature, then your MBP has both video and audio capability through the A/V port!  If not, your MBP probably does not.

$REVIEW.: ...at least at its current pricepoint.  I had steered clear of these after reading a number of negative Amazon reviews complaining about their long-term reliability, so I instead ordered the Alesis M1 Active 320 USB Studio Monitor Pair initially.  Sounded great, but the right speaker (the one with the amp) went out on me less than a week in for no reason...I had been using it very gently and moderately!  Figured it was just bad luck and ordered another one, which turned out to be DOA (same right speaker)...so I said what the hell, shipped them back for a refund, and ordered these M-Audios instead, for an extra forty bucks at the time.  I figure that if I like the sound, I'll just spend fourteen bucks or so for a 3 year Square Trade warranty to cover my backside...it's still much cheaper than any powered speakers of comparable quality.Well, I have to say that these AV40s, despite having a bigger mid-woof (4" compared to the Alesis M1's 3"), a larger rear port, bigger and heavier in general, somehow put out LESS bass!  I tried setting Windows 7's Bass management high-pass filter to 50Hz and the bangin' drum line of Amy Winehouse's "You Know I'm No Good" really distorted...had to go all the way to 80Hz to get rid of that, and of course 80Hz is M-Audio's official spec for bass extension.  So these speakers are even LESS of a good match for you bassheads out there...stick to 2.1 systems, y'all.  (And if you are the sort to blast music or want to rock out a party, you're certainly barking up the wrong tree.)Also, the tweeter seems less sparkly and dynamic than the Alesis...the M-Audios have nice full mids and fairly accurate highs, but attack and decay is not quite as good.  They are much more of a smooth, mellow, laid-back speaker although not greatly lacking in detail.  There is however a slight treble roll-off, which probably accounts for the warm tonal quality.  As work/office speakers, it's critical that they are totally non-fatiguing...you can listen to them for hours and hours.  Especially good for jazz, classical, and vocal-dominated acoustic rock/folk---which just happen to be my 3 favorite genres.  The all-important midrange is luscious.  So, all in all, I am quite happy with them and will hang on to them.But if I had never experienced the Alesis speaks, I doubt that I would be complaining at all.  For computer speakers, these AV-40s decimate their similarly-priced competition, especially the likes of Altec Lansing, Creative, Logitech, or (cough, choke, gag!) Bose, which typically have overpowering and boomy bass and shrill treble with an appalling hole in the midrange.Hopefully they will last a hell of a lot longer than the Alesis speakers, knock on wood!  I am not real optimistic because the back of the speaker gets a little warm after prolonged usage, even at the very moderate volumes that I use.  Also, with music off, if you turn the volume knob up to the 1 to 4 o'clock position, there is a definite hiss...not unusual of A/B amps.  What I can't figure out is why these powered monitors don't come with T-amps, which are so cheap, compact, totally cool-running, and have spectacular sound quality?  M-Audio, I hope you are reading this review!

$review_text.: I am a power user of external storage drives, streaming about 50GB of daily backups


I am a longtime user of Western Digital internal and external drives, but I figured I would give the Seagate a try because of the good reviews

That did not work out so well for me

First, my workstation stopped recognizing the drive; then I started having disk read and write failures

All attempts to recover drive data failed

So it was nine months and into the trash, just like so much Chinese mass-produced-for-pennies junk
Problem is, this isn't a toy squirt gun


So it's back to Western Digital, which, yes, is more Chinese mass-produced product, but WD gear has consistently worked for me

Frankly, there is so much variation in all of the drives from all makers that it's Vegas Night when you need to buy one

Sigh.

It's battery lasts, the transceiver and storing it is great, I've only worn the finish off two but maybe that's a good sign.

For Skype and other conference uses, it does the job well and is worth the few extra dollars over lesser models.The built-in stand results in the camera being placed on a table and producing those unflattering up-the-nostrils views. Mounting it higher produces a more flattering view but draping it over the top of the monitor may not work on some montors. Taping it to the monitor back is more secure.\As always, kudos to Amazon.

$review_text.: I have never been so completely satisfied by a product purchased on amazon.com.  With the daily deal on Friday I purchased the 240gb and 120gb and received them on Saturday since I was too excited to wait for Monday.  I installed the smaller one into my 2006 Dell Inspiron E1405 and the boot time went from 30 seconds to around 12 and my Desktop that I personally built last year boots in less than 10 connected to the sata 6.0 port with appropriate cable.  I get a 7.9 rating on the windows index and my computer is that much faster.Ease of use:  It is a simple installation for even a beginner user, you are just replacing the previous hdd with two connections and you can fit it anywhere in even the smallest desktop with it being only 2.5 inches long.  If it goes on sale again everyone needs to get on this and even at regular price the SSD's from Sandisk do not disappoint.

$REVIEW.: This is the best iPad case for me so far and for $6 you can't beat that! I have the New iPad  ( apple decided to take this particular generation off the market few months after it was release, I was little bummed) Anyway, this cover/case snapped on well. I think it has better protection than my older cover I used to use before this one.. I been using  this cover Manvex Slim and Compact Leather Folio Case for The New iPad 4th Generation (will also fit iPad 3 and 2) Smart Cover w/ Sleep/Wake Function, for a while there I was satisfied with it, I have few small issues when I had this cover, the groove isn't deep enough sometimes my iPad just slips when I put if on landscape position and the 2nd is that it' wasn't rotating so making the iPad stand on a portrait is not really advisable. But I've had it since March 2012, it held up well until last week I decided it's time to get new cover for my iPad because one of my kids (5 years old) decided to stick chewing um on the inside where the groove are. I took if off of course but it leaves a little stain.Anyways, this new cover is fantastic! I was very happy I bought this instead of the other ones I look at. The sleep and wake function works very well, but remember to have the iPad in the right direction hehe coz the other night my iPad was rotated upside down (in the landscape position: the camera in on the right side and the home button is on the left side) I didn't notice it at first but I wonder why the sleep wake is not working so I found out that my iPad is in wrong position so turn in to the right position and there the sleepwake function works like a charm.The groove on this new cover are deep enough that it holds up the iPad in both landscape and portrait positions very well, unlike the previous covers I used. I know I won't have problem with my iPad constantly slips off when on landscape or portrait positions.  With my old case, it's so annoying to constantly try to get my iPad to stay standing without it slipping so I find myself holding the entire thing most of the time..Right now as I am typing this review I am actually typing on my iPad on landscape position and not once it slips off the 2nd groove,  Awesome! The iPad has a tendency of slipping off the groove in the very first groove but still it hold up better much better that my previous case. I'm so happy with this purchase, I can't believe I waited this long,but I guess it's a good thing because I would have probably end up buying a different one if I had been not been patient enough to find this perfect cover, Lol.Really I highly recommend this base on two things it rotates in circle, grooves are deep, the sleep and wake function very good. About the quality? Well, the outside leather doesn't feel like very durable, or doesn't feel like it would hold up good with two little kids but I don't know it's only Beene few days and so far I'm pleased with this overall package, it's pretty showing the apple logo :) . To be honest I must say  the material doesn't feel as high quality compared to the cover mentioned above but for $6? It's the best out there, I usually chose quality pay extra, but if  I have to pick which one to get between the this one or my older cases I'd definitely pick this one! It's not only for the price but its also because it functions very well and I think it has more protection too, it covers the entire back...I'm giving this 4 star because  this is not perfect as in perfect, minus a star on the quality of the leather but everything else is very good.Sorry guys for the lengthy reviews haha,  I just want you all  to know that I really love this case so far!

$REVIEW.: I bought the BG-E2N for my 50D and love it. I wanted a grip for my 5D2 also. I've been contemplating aftermarkets for about 1/3 the price (5D2) and 1/2 the price (50D), but the thought of "you get what you pay for" looms over my head every time i think about it. I've taken the plunge and bought both genuine grips. Now, $162 for the 50D grip ($65 generic Linkdelight), $262 for the 5D2 grip ($82 generic Linkdelight). The only difference between the 2 Canon grips are: 5D2 has AF button and is $100+. I really wanted the generic grips to save some $$$ since this is a hobby, but didnt want to waste $$$ on junk. My thoughts regarding this grip (BG-E6): major rip-off. Its been 2 months that i've had this grip and I still cant find the "real" battery (at non-gouging prices). Otherwise its an excellent piece and makes the camera feel "full" and heavier. I've read some reviews about the generics, but at the time, much info wasn't avail. Hopefully someone out there has both the generic and real one to really do a side-by-side comparison. I am giving it only 3 stars because of the $100+ over the 50D grip and Canon's reluctance to make the batteries more avail.

It gets as warm as any other drive, but it seems to handle it fine too. Performance has been as expected.  Only issue was with the auto-power feature--drives were not recognized when rebooting, but I attribute that to a problem I had with my PC not shutting down. When the shut down problem was fixed the drives were recognized as advertised.  I have no complaints after over 4 months of use.

$REVIEW.: I bought this stylus to use with my GTablet at work, and it actually works a lot better with the GTab than the Griffon Stylus that I use with my ipad.  This one slides across the screen more smoothly than the Griffon and it seems to be more responsive, requiring a lighter touch to launch apps or scroll pages.  So why only 4 stars?  Because of the idiotic design decision to put some silly string with a plastic bulb on the top rather than a handy clip like the Griffon has.  I could not use this with my iPad, which is my carry around tablet, because I have no way to attach it to the case and I would end up losing it in 20 minutes.  Even if there WERE some way to secure the stylus to my ipad case using the ridiculous string, I don't think I'd really want the thing swinging around loosely every time I pick it up.  Thankfully I mostly use the Gtab at my desk so its not as much of an issue, but I'm finding myself looking around for an old-fashioned metal pen clip that I can slide on to it so I will be able to secure it when I do have to take the tablet off my desk.  Dumb decision. Doesn't ruin the product but definitely worth taking a point off the rating.

$review_text.: I have about two dozen of M42 lenses, all primes. Have used Fotodiox M42 to Eos adapter without the AF chip, and was quite happy with it. Decided to upgrade and bought another one with AF confirm chip.Pros: will aid focusing greatly, price is just right, EXIF support,  same build quality as Non-AF adapter, all my M42 lenses hit infinity at the infinity mark on the lens, sturdy, durable, fits well, have mounted lenses weighing over 2lbs and it holds them just fine; focus confirmation works - camera beeps once focus is obtained, can be programmed to lens's specific focal length, aperture and focusing method (front or rear unit focusing).Cons: instructions are bit confusing, but not that much. If you decided to program Dandelion Chip, in aperture priority (AV) mode pictures might come out slightly overexposed, that's due to camera doing double light metering off of Aperture value from dandelion chip, but it's not a problem if you're using your camera in full Manual mode. No other issues.Conclusion: it does what it suppose to and does it quite well. Just don't expect it to do impossible things such as improve picture quality or whatever.

$review_text.: My criteria when selecting my radio were that it be a CD receiver head unit that:1. Plays mp3 formats;2. Has integrated Bluetooth for phone calls;3. Has some sort of auxiliary input for an external music player; and4. Costs less than $200.Additionally, this radio has the following:1. Dual USB (plus the standard input jack); and2. Bluetooth AD2P (music transfer via bluetooth).I am very happy with my purchase. If I could make one or two comments based on some of the reviews for this model (and the KD-R800):First, Bluetooth connections are really finnicky. Do your homework and make sure that your phone supports the appropriate Bluetooth version (in this case, version 2.0). My phone is a crummy "dumb phone," and though it isn't on JVC's list of devices (it is Bluetooth 2.0), it works just fine. Getting your radio to link up with your phone requires getting the radio to make a connection with the phone, and the phone to make a connection with the radio. If this isn't done correctly, your phone will not want to automatically connect to the radio when you start your car back up. It is an exercise that requires two pieces of equipment (your radio AND your phone), and so those that proclaim in their reviews that the problem is with the radio may not always be 100% accurate in their analysis.Next, comments have been made (also in reference to the KD-R800; discussion is appropriate here because the mic is the same for both models) about the quality of the microphone and the "ugly" factor of having the exposed wire running on the inside of your car. The mic connection is a standard mic plug. If you really do not like the mic included, you can get a new one. As for the ugliness, it is really pretty easy to hide mic wire. I ran mine underneath the dash panels and snaked it out just above my steering wheel. Done that way, it is invisible. I did the same thing with the rear USB plug. It comes out next to my emergency brake and is hidden the whole way.All in all, this is a great radio for the price and I am far from disappointed.

They came packaged with a set of 3 ear sizes and I'm sure that should cover most people's size preference. They are by far the most comfortable in ear headphones I've owned.These do a really good job blocking noise as well. I wear them under my motorcycle helmet when I ride to block out wind noise, and they do a decent job keeping me from going deaf. When I'm just riding casually I'll play some music through them and I don't have to max out the volume to hear the music like I do through other headphones I've used.  They have a low profile and don't get shoved into my ears under the helmet. It slides on and off right over them, which is very nice when getting ready to ride.

Make sure you have it oriented correctly and use firm pressure until it goes in all the way. After that, turn the computer and it should recognize the new hardware all by itself. No software to install.I've had this for over a month now and not one thing to complain about. As for any OCing, I haven't done any so I can't speak for that.

$REVIEW.: Where to start.  First, how do you mess up zip ties? well let me tell you.  On some of these the latch was broke, or simply didn't work.  When you found one that did zip correctly, it would snap in half as if it were frozen.  1 out of every 3 zip ties I used broke in my hand.  I used over half of these on a single computer build.  I will never buy anything from this company again.  I mean they really found a way to screw up a zip tie.

$REVIEW.: It's been 10 minutes after I posted my last review...In that time, I have installed the latest software and updated the firmware.  The two really took me about 5 minutes.The update adds a nice feature for single-PC networks.  If a device is labeled a single-user device, then you don't need to take control of it every time you want to use it.I also found out that it is possible to boot others off the server (actually everyone).If you go to the Admin tab on the server SW, and edit the server settings (something simple like a password change), it will reboot the hardware (not your PC), which will disconnect all shared devices.  This is a rather brute-force approach, but the manual doesn't indicate any other way.Even after an extra 10 minutes of use, I think this device is the best thing since a USB thumb drive (which you can connect to the server as well).This thing is just TOO COOL!!!!- end of gushing -

$REVIEW.: These infrared stick-on's allow you to transmit signals inside of closed cabinets or from units that do not have line of sight to the components.  They work ok, but the adhesive supplied seems to be derived from the sputum of gum chewers, in other words, it is tacky but certainly not going to hold anything together.  If you want them to stick you will have to get some double sided 3M tape and replace what came with the emitters.

$review_text.: This camera "armor" can be described as a tightly fit bag made of elastic, soft neoprene. It offers a certain degree of protection against minor bumps or vibration, and prevents scratches.  It is somewhat oversized for an E-P2 with the M. Zuiko 14-42 mm kit lens, and it is somewhat too tight with the Lumix G 45-200mm lens.It comes with two options for attaching it to the camera - either to the tripod socket or to a rubber ring that goes around the lens.All in all, this is a good compromise between size and the degree of protection, albeit I would like to see this kind of armor with a more rigid construction.
$SUMMARY.: Decent soft protection for your camera

$review_text.: The good thing about this camera is that it has a tight seal to prevent water from damaging the camera. Have used the camera to take pictures underwater with no damage to the camera. However, that is the only good thing about this camera.The bad things.1. The picture is poor in quality often too bright or washed out. I have already tried adjusting the settings but I still get poor picture quality.2. Picture also appears grainy even on highest setting.3. The LCD views (front and back) is too dark that it is hard to see when you are taking pictures outdoor.4. Slow flash. You will have to wait at least 3 to 5 seconds for the flash to charge.5. Slow shutter. You will have to remain stationary when taking pictures. I was using this on a Kayak trip and can't get good picture if we are not completely on a still position.6. Included battery did not last long. You can however use a lithium ion battery which will give you a full day of battery power.Of course, I may have gotten a defective product as there are also lots of positive reviews about this camera.  I have decided to return mine. I was able to get the refund with no problem. If you want to give this camera a try, I suggest that you test it right away once you receive it so that you will have a plenty of time to return it or replace it with a better product.

$REVIEW.: I've had this radio for over a year now (and this is my 2nd one--I broke the first one). I love this radio so much, I bought one for my sister for Xmas last year. I listen to this radio EVERY morning for an hour; a set of batteries lasts about 6 MONTHS! Yeah, you heard that right--MONTHS! Add in a few extra hours here and there (weekends, etc.) and it comes out to roughly 200 hours on a set of batteries. My only gripe is that I wish it had a backlight for the display. I have to bend down and look at the display to see any data. The adjustable timer is really handy. The timer has preset times (10, 20, 30, 40, 60 minutes) but it's adjustable so that you can set any time on it (e.g. 3, 5, or 15 minutes, etc.). This timer is great for making sure that you don't take too long in the shower or for timing your hair coloring, etc. There are 2 different timers on this radio: one is a countdown timer that results in a beeping alarm when the timer reaches it's end; the other is a play timer that results in the radio shutting off when the timer reaches it's end. If you are using the play timer, the display WILL display the clock so that you can listen to the radio and still see the time of day. The play timer is really great because I can turn in the radio and set it for 60 minutes while I get ready. If I forget to turn the radio off before I leave in the morning, it doesn't drain the batteries because it shuts itself off. One downside is that when you have the countdown timer set, the countdown is what displays and you cannot see the time or the station you're on unless you turn off the countdown timer. While the presets are limited to 5 AM and 5 FM, that's plenty for my area. Digital tuning makes it easy to find any station you want anyway. Setting the presets is simple and intuitive. This radio gets plenty loud. I get up 2 hours before my wife so I usually play it at only 1/4 volume and it still wakes her up on occasion! The speaker does distort at full volume but full volume is louder than you need for a bathroom radio in my opinion. I never play it at full; the highest I've ever needed it was 1/2 - 2/3 volume. It has a weather function and an external antenna; both work as they should. To avoid the plastic membrane protecting the button controls on the top from deteriorating and causing leaks, I recommend cleaning this radio with water ONLY. Water and a sponge or an old toothbrush should be all you need to clean this.I highly recommend this radio!Incidentally, I broke the first one of these radios that I got by changing the batteries while my hands were still wet. The smallest amount of water got into the radio via the battery compartment and shorted it out. It quit working right after that. I tried to take the radio appart to see if I could fix the problem and discovered that this radio is solidly put together and every seam has rubber cauking. So as long as you use your head when you're changing batteries and don't do it with wet hands, this radio should last MANY years! The battery compartment is the only place where water can enter this radio. That little lesson cost me $50. Yeah, I know it was stupid, but I'm hoping you can learn from my error.
$SUMMARY.: One of the best radios I've owned let alone shower radios!

The monitor appears to lean slightly to the right.  If I didn't tell you, it would hardly be noticeable if at all.

$REVIEW.: The Targus case is very stylish, sleek and slim, and holds the iPad snugly
The case works OK as a stand in Landscape position, but it isn't designed for such a use and isn't all that safe


When in Portrait position the angle is too sharp to use most of the time
The case has magnets to turn the iPad on/off, but these magnets aren't strong enough to keep the case closed, which kind of ruins the feature


If the cover is going to keep flapping open, why would I want my iPad turning on every time? (you can turn the 'wake with cover' feature off on the iPad, the pref is under General in Settings)The iPad slides in through the top, then there is a little flap of material that folds over it to keep it in
It is probably more secure than it looks, but I still don't like it (with my iPad 2 anyway -- the new iPad fits snugly and will not fall out on its own)

It also leaves the upper corners of the iPad exposed and unprotected


Also, the camera used for FaceTime is partially blocked (for the new iPad) and is hard to maneuver into an effective place
I think this is probably due to the fact that the new iPad fits so snugly, but doesn't sit quite centered in the case (iPad 2 seemed fine)


All other buttons, switches and the other camera are easily accessible (both versions of iPad).Overall the case is sleek and protects the iPad decently, but it could still use some tuning for functionality


And it needs a price drop.Here is the case I use (I really like it too, though its magnet feature doesn't work at all with the new iPad):BoxWave Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 Smart Case - Ardent Red, Premium Synthetic iPad3 Leather Folio Case w/ Multi-Angle Stand for iPad 2 and The new iPad (3rd Generation)

$review_text.: My router has always been in the basement resulting in weak wireless signals in some areas of my house. Now my router is on the main floor while the modem remains in the basement. I bought these because they are small. I don't need high speed since this is only the link to the internet which at best is 15 Meg. But, I do want it to be reliable. After 1 week, it seems to be reliable. However, I have not yet streamed anything. I did have a couple of unexplained disconnects that I resolved by unplugging one adapter and then plugging it back in. Since then, I've moved one of the adapters off of a circuit that is protected by a AFCI (arc fault) breaker. Set up did not go as described. It took me hours to get these two connected to each other. At one point I think one of them was connected to my neighbors powerline network. I also set his up about a year ago. That setup (also D-Link) did not go well either.I can't find any instructions on how to unpair the DHP-309AV. Anyway, I think all is well now.

$REVIEW.: So I had my case laid flat on the floor while I was working on installing parts. I decided to quit for the day and turned the lights off. I was going back to the window to adjust the blinds when I knocked into something and heard a BANG and sickening rattle. I turned the light back on and discovered that I'd accidentally kicked the front bezel off! I bent down, took a look at it, expecting all kinds of horror, but it was in mint condition. The bezel snapped right back on. Whoever said that this part of the case is "fragile" doesn't know what they're talking about.Moving on, this thing is a sleek SOB. I love the black powder coating on the inside, the top-mounted USB ports and power button (I don't expect to be accidentally kicking the computer off now), and the large, quiet case fans. The rear fan is a bit difficult to remove, I have to admit. Its wiring is tucked away so neatly that it takes some fine manipulation to extract it. The fans are also 4-pin Molex only, and with the three of them, it's possible that you won't have enough Molex connectors left over on your power supply unit to attach everything else. The bottom mounting of the PSU also means that the motherboard power cable (the smaller 4-6 pin one) may not have enough play to neatly tuck it underneath the motherboard on its way to the plug near the top.The expansion card slots also use a tool-less fastener design that *is* relatively fragile, but you can still use standard case screws. Speaking of screws, the case comes with quite a variety of them, plus plenty of brass motherboard standoffs, some zip ties, and eight silicone grommets to attach to your fans to reduce vibrational noise. Plus rail mounts for your hard drives; just snap them on and slide the drive into the slot. Very handy. The tool-less lock for the 5.25-inch bays is just on one side, but you can fasten the other side with some supplied screws.If there's any downside here, it's that it's difficult to get fan filters in the 140mm size. The front bezel has a built-in filter, but the top 140mm fan does not. (The rear fan is 120mm). These are just not very common, nor are they inexpensive.Still, it's an attractive case, its fans are pretty quiet (their sheer size allows them to move a lot of air without making too much noise), and the rear has a feature that I didn't have on my old case: Viewing it from above, you can look down straight past the motherboard I/O plate and see the connectors on the expansion cards below it. This makes plugging in video cards and whatnot much easier. Customarily, the I/O plate is framed in a way that blocks your view of the lower area of the case when viewing from that angle.All in all, a pleasing -- and physically robust -- computer case. If you're wondering about its size, its dimensions are industry-standard for a "mid tower." The carrying handle doesn't add much weight, and that is offset a bit by using mesh on the front bezel, instead of a solid material. However, the handle assembly's construction is such that the top fan grill can't have anything mounted on its exterior. The assembly can be removed, however.

$review_text.: I've now had the Fantom Green Drive for about 3 months

 Wanted to use it a while and try a few different things before writing the review

 Also my G5 Mac tower did not at first have an eSATA card..

 If you try transferring a couple hundred GB over USB 2.0, you can pretty much start it and go to work, it may be done when you return

 With the MAC, the set up was seamless and with the new Tempo Sonnet eSATA card (see my other review), the transfers were lightning fast

 The fanless operation had me concerned for over-heating, but I have to say after leaving it on for over 60 days now and using it daily for automatic file backup and frequent storage & retrieveal of files - esp movie files sized 50GB+, I am astonished at the performance of this drive
 No perceptible heat emanating either
 Read- and write-times over eSATA are still leaving me with that stupid look you get when technology is ahead of your comprehension..

you don't have to like being left behind, you just have to accept it


Plus it's 'green' - apparently hard drives can consume dumploads of juice, and this one saves a few greenback saving on power consumption, which is a huge plus


 I'd spent countless hours trying to find the drive with the best combination of speed, reliability and value, and I have to say I'm gloating a bit right now with the Fantom Green Drive!

$review_text.: I got this because my cord that came with my Ipad was fraying at the plug in to pad itself
The cord is great and the price was certainly better than the Apple store, even with postage

It works great and I think better and faster than my old cord

So I may have been right about the frayed part slowing down the charging process
At any rate it is a good buy and the folks that sent it were timely too.

$review_text.: This kit is basically a bunch of separate AmazonBasics iPod accessories grouped together in one box. It's also significantly cheaper than buying all of them separately. There's 2 silicone cases, a USB dock connector cable, 2 screen protectors, a USB car charger adapter, and a coiled audio cable with 3.5mm plugs. All of them are of pretty good quality.The cases come in black and purple, and have grooves on the back which gives you a bit better grip on your iPod. I have no real use for the second case, but I guess it's there if you need it. There's bumps where the volume and lock buttons are, which allow you to use them even though they're full covered. There's also openings for the camera and mic on the back, and speaker, 3.5mm audio jack, and dock connector on the bottom. While the case protects the top and sides of the iPod great, the bottom doesn't feel as snug, and is only protected by a flimsy strip of silicone that half-covers the bottom edge. I already needed to replace my iPod once due to dropping it on this edge and cracking the glass, so I was disappointed when I saw this otherwise well-made case didn't protect the bottom as well. I guess it would be hard to protect the bottom without covering the bottom ports up.The USB dock connector cable charges and syncs data, no complains about that. The cable seems to fit a bit more snugly into the iPod's port, and there's a larger area to grip the connector compared to the original Apple-supplied cable  Nothing really bad here.The 3.5mm coiled audio cable is also pretty well-made. I used it to hook up my iPod to a stereo system, and to record stuff on my laptop. The coil can be a little stiff at first, but after you stretch it out it's fine.The screen protectors have holes for the front-facing camera and home buttons, and come with a cleaning cloth. You *have* to make sure your screen is completely spotless before applying the protector on, as even the slightest piece of dust will make air bubbles form under the plastic film. Maybe it's just me, but I actually think these are slightly better made than cheaper ones available elsewhere, as my fingers seem to glide over the protector better.And lastly, the USB car charging adapter works fine. Plug the USB cable into the iPod, and the other end into the adapter, and it charges fine. The adapter has a small blue LED to let you know it's getting power. The LED is actually quite bright. In my car, the light ends up being positioned in such a way that it can actually get annoying while driving at night. This isn't really a fault of the product, but just something I've noticed while using it.All of them have the AmazonBasics logo branded on them somewhere. At $20, it's a bit pricier than buying some other accessories, but most of them are well-made, maybe with the slight exception of the bottom of the silicone case.
$SUMMARY.: Good quality kit.

$REVIEW.: I decided to replace the GT 545 card from the Alienware x51 for this card.I got a used one but it was in perfect conditions and even with all the extras that come in the package.Installation was a breeze, no complications at all.This card is just amazing, perhaps I am excited because this is the first high end card I have had
It runs even modern games at a very good and high speed and very cool temperatures.This card is one of the best in the market while looking Price vs Performance, so it gives a lot for the buck.Pros: Excellent price vs Performance, Excellent iddle (35C) and load (65) temperatures, Very good build quality, Very easy to install, Runs games at excellent speeds.Cons: None I can think of.

$REVIEW.: I want to say up front that I really wasn't expecting this to work as nicely as it has turned out to work

I was thinking that it would be a device that does okay at a few things, but ends up feeling pretty limited
In actuality, it's managed to really surprise me with how much of my computing time it has taken over
I've actually been finding myself reaching for it when I'm sitting at my desk with my (much more powerful and running MS Windows 7) desktop.The limitations here are really important to consider

You can not install a whole lot of extra software onto the device (by default, anyway, with some tinkering you could make it behave like a more standard Linux-style device)
You're not going to be installing MS Office 2013 on here


Though, if you really wanted, you could use Office 365


(On that note, though, it'd be worth giving Google Docs and other options a chance


For most purposes, like writing school papers and working on resumes, the 'free' options are more than adequate.)What the device can do, is anything that you're currently doing through a Chrome window on a desktop or another laptop
For a lot of people this will mean social networking, video calls, taking online MOOC classes, reading the news, writing on blogs, shopping online, and that kind of thing
For a lot of people, there are enough Internet-based services that this'll probably cover everything you do with a computer regularly.Speed - This thing runs extremely fast


4GB is a lot of memory on something that isn't doing a whole lot more than running a web browser

The processor keeps up with its needs very well
The Haswell architecture has a really good reputation for power-efficiency, and I haven't really been bothered by battery limitations
A lot of devices start threatening to cut me off entirely at 10% or so of power, to ensure they have enough in reserve to not lose anything in storage

This seems content to run down to 5% or so before it starts to nudge me about a potential problem.Storage - 16gb is pretty small, but you get a decent chunk of Google Drive storage for 2 years (100GB) as part of the deal
You can also easily bolster it with USB thumb drives and SD or MicroSD cards, or even full-sized external hard drives.Doing More - When I have wanted to do things that the Chromebook can't, there's a remote desktop feature in Chrome


I flipped it on and basically used the chromebook as a remote client for my desktop
The desktop did all the work of running the software that the portable device couldn't, and I could see and interact with everything that was happening remotely.Video Out - You can get video to another screen with the HDMI port, but this feature was working strangely

It didn't seem willing to go to 1920x1080 for me, and so the resolution was never quite right


This may have been something to do with the fact that I was hooking it up to a TV rather than a device designed to be a monitor, and I hope it's something they eventually fix in the software so that it works more smoothly.ChomeCast - If you have a Chromecast, you can easily 'cast' your Chrome tabs on the Chomebook to a TV that way
Easier than using the HDMI-out, really

It only shows the tab and not your mouse cursor, which makes it impractical as a way to totally use the device with a TV as the screen

For watching videos or reading a lot of text on web pages, though, it works very nicely.Keyboard/Mouse - The trackpad works fine and includes gestures (for example, 2 fingers on the trackpad dragging downward is scroll down)


The keyboard is full-sized and reasonably comfortable
It took a few days to adjust and for my typo-rate to drop, but things are fine now


There is bluetooth support, and you absolutely can hook up an external bluetooth keyboard and mouse (I'm sure this also applies to USB if you wanted)


I did it


It worked fine.Internet access - Wireless only, no ethernet port (it's not really big enough to have an ethernet port.)
You might be able to do wired internet using a USB adapter, I'm not sure

Keep in mind that having Internet access is pretty important to really using this thing, though

It's designed to be an Internet-heavy device.Value - This is what make's the Chromebooks really shine


It comes with the previously mentioned Google Drive space, and also passes for a plane-based Internet service

If you're someone who uses those things anyway and is paying for them, buying the chromebook pretty much pays for itself and it'd almost be silly not to try one out
(If you don't use those things, obviously it's not such a big deal.) Otherwise, the value you get for the simple hardware that's included is still good.Security - And for a few people I know, this is going to be the main reason I recommend a Chromebook

I think we all probably have one or two people in our lives who really aren't comfortable with computers, don't take naturally to figuring out what's safe to click and what's not, and never install patches

Often, they just use the computer for email, a little social networking, and maybe some browser-based games

These devices do those things well, and their limitations are actually a huge benefit because they auto-patch and they don't let you install the kinds of things that often lead to horrible virus infections

For some people, having one of these will work out far better than having a Windows Desktop with much more powerful hardware, because it does what they need to do and refuses to do the things that might get them in trouble.There's a lot to digest there, but the upshot is that this is a really surprisingly nice device


It has a few issues that I've come across and it's definitely not perfect, but it really does well at the things it was intended to do


On the other hand, it's definitely not for people who need to install Windows software, who don't have an Internet connection, or who have the skill and motivation to maintain tight control over their own computers.

It's so fast you can barely boot into safe mode if needed! Anyways...It runs like a dream on my desktop. 8.1 added the start menu. So people who were not liking the &#34;metro&#34; style are in luck! Gaming is just as good on it as with Windows 7. The main critiques of windows 8 are just that it is &#34;too different&#34;. Without change, there is NO innovation. While this OS might not be innovative per say. Its a HUGE step up from Windows 7. I recommend Windows 8 to anyone building or buying a PC.GOOD LUCk!

 As long as you can live with the short legs that don't extend, this is a very good tripod
 However, with the flexible legs that wrap around a pipe or other object, you can put it at any height you want
 I mainly use it to take photos for eBay sales and often put it on top of couple of phone books to raise it to the proper height for my photo tent.All in all, this tripod is worth the price.

$REVIEW.: I have been a big fan of Sonos for awhile, already owning a Play:3, two Play:5's, and a Sub
I decided to buy the Playbar with another Sub, because I knew it would be exactly what I needed to upgrade a mediocre Vizio sound bar I had prior to this.The sound quality of the bar is definitely great

I think you can compare it to a pair of Play:3's, which is a similar price point

I tried it without the Sub, and I can say that it does sound competent solo as you would expect

However, when you pair it with the Sub, it takes on a whole new life and the music becomes warm and rich


It is a lot of expense, but if you can get the pair, it is an almost perfect setup.The greatest thing about the Playbar is that it is two devices in one

It has autoplay that kicks in when you turn on your TV, and the TV audio takes over


You can also use the Sonos app to play all of your favorite music services, podcasts, etc


All of the great Sonos features you know and love, and a great soundbar for your TV as well.The big surprise that I had is that I could use my Logitech Harmony remote to control the volume

I didn't even know it had that feature when I bought it, and I expected I'd have to use the app to control the volume like my other Sonos devices
My Harmony was already set up to use the Vizio, so when I went through the Playbar setup process I was able to "learn" the Vizio volume +/- and mute


Now I can control the volume from my Harmony, and I didn't even have to reprogram it
The learning process is very simple.Mounting this was super easy as well
I bought the Sonos kit separately for this, which comes with everything you need in the box


It would be nice if the mounting kit came with the Playbar given the price

However, some people likely won't need it, as they'll lay the Playbar in front of the TV.Overall I'm very pleased with this, as I am with all of my Sonos equipment
It just works, and it sounds great.

$REVIEW.: I've owned two RF20s.  After years of use, the buttons started wearing out.  I bought a second thinking I could transfer the programs to the new one using the "clone" feature.  Turns out I could not because had changed their firmware since I bought the first one!  Given how long it takes to program this remote, I consider that an EPIC FAIL!  I have since bought a Logitech Harmony 700. Instead of spending many hours programming & learning as I did with the RF20, I simply hooked the Logitech up to my computer and used their software to set it up.  The Harmony 700 took no time to set up and even does what I could never figure out how to do with the RF20.  Bottom line in the RF20 is ancient technology Don't waste your time and money.  Get a Logitech Harmony.

$review_text.: To start off, shipping was on time. This is the Blue version of 1TB that I have ordered for my dad's computer build. This is the OEM version, so no screws and sata cables. Just what I needed because I had some screws that came with my case. Just wanted to try out a different version because I am using the Green version of this, so giving my Dad the Blue version. All and all, this is a brand that I trust for my HDD and other storage needs. Thank you again Western Digital for your fine products and I am looking forward to shopping with you again.

$REVIEW.: This keyboard is so sleek and small, yet it is full-sized and the keys are well laid out. The mouse is very comfortable. The 2.4GHz receiver works from anywhere in my house. Previous wireless keyboards that I have had barely work at 5 feet, let alone in the front yard or upstairs. I have had it on for 3 months straight and the batteries are still going so it is power efficient and must have some sort of built in sleep mode for conserving battery life when you aren't using it.I've never had Genius products before, but I will always consider them now.Highly recommend this product.

$review_text.: Because everything written about this drive refers to "portability" I checked with Seagate to find out if I could use it with my iMac. They didn't see why not, so I unpacked it and hooked it up. I did encounter a couple of issues with the set-up - perhaps because I don't have anything stored on a "cloud" and have no interest in social networking (I log on to Facebook now and then purely to see my friends' photos, then spend forever trying to figure out the latest hiding place for the sign-off to deactivate my account). Anyway, the dashboard just didn't want to install on my hard drive. But finally after a restart the software was installed. The big thing about this is that I wanted to replace the big external hard drive I've been using for the past several years with something small and sleek, and this definitely fills the bill. It has a tiny footprint and more than enough space at 500 GB to hold the contents of my iMac's hard drive. Having checked the drive this morning (after installing it yesterday afternoon) I was pleased to see that it is working perfectly and backing up my files. So I would definitely recommend this for people wanting external backups for their desktop computers. Just know that you may have some issues with the software unless you do an immediate restart. And there is no mention of that anywhere on their site or in the minimal amount of info that actually comes in the package.

I bought it because I thought it would have tons of room, but I find myself wrestling with it just to fit my laptop. Maybe its the zipper style and since you can fully unzip, maybe that's the issue.I would say that if your laptop is more than an 1.25" thick, than look elsewhere, but my 2.5" thick laptop is stuffed.Don't let that part drag you down, it's an awesome bag, lots of handy pockets and chachkis to make carrying a bunch of stuff easy.

$REVIEW.: I have a house built in the 90's so it has a large recess where the older/thicker TV's would set.  I needed to bring my flatscreen out to the front of the recess because putting it on a stand inside the recess made it set back too far.  this worked perfectly.  I was worried it would wobble, but I have a 50" sony attached with the arm nearly fully extended and it is solid.  I think this thing weighs more than the TV....its heavy.  I'm a girl, and I installed primarily by myself without much hassle.  you need someone to hold it up while you put the first lag bolts in and someone to help lift the TV on it.  If you don't have studs at 16 inches, there are ways around that and they give you every conceivable tv bolt and bolts if you need to install on masonry.  handy that there is a level on it.  super-happy.  now my tv sits right up to the front of the opening and there is a ton of room behind and under it to put other electronics instead of having it on a stand taking up space.

You would think that the required driver would automatically install from the installation cd that comes with the device. On the contrary. It seems that dozens if not hundreds of others have the same problem. Windows cannot find the correct driver on the cd or the web. But it gets better! I downloaded drivers from their website, but not a one of them worked. In fact, one driver that is supposed to be a windows driver turns out to be a Mac driver. I also downloaded and installed the most recent version of the software, but that doesn't work either.  There is something fundamentally flawed with this software if installing it is so difficult.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this drive because of its high-speed eSATA connection, high capacity (2 TB) and extensive software package.  I knew going in that Iomega didn't provide the backup software on disk.  It had to be downloaded but this was no problem for me ... or so I thought.  The drive installed in a flash and was instantly recognized by Windows 7 Professional.  Smiles all over my face.  Next I tried to download the Iomega Protection Suite based on EMC's Retrospect Express.  Supposedly there are two versions for Windows and one for Mac, each with its own license code, but the literature was so scanty, I couldn't figure out if I'd be better off with Express or Express HD.  Neither version would download, install and work with the license codes provided.  Okay, not to worry.  What I really wanted was Iomega's NeverDown software which apparently clones the entire internal drive (like Apricot) so you can actually operate your computer from the backup drive if your main drive goes south.  Once you replace your main drive, you can shift everything back over to it and you're back to "normal."  And since the Iomega is on an eSATA connection it should perform just about as fast from the clone as from the original.  That didn't work either.  So I tried to "chat" with an Iomega tech.  No response after the "Hi, I'm blabbermouth. How are you?" "Well if I were fine I wouldn't be typing to someone I don't know.  But here's the problem ...." No response, no response, no respone, Still checking.  No response.  No response.  Still checking .....  I log off and try again.  This time, I got a response:  "You'd better call in to solve this problem."  So I call.  "NeverDown, what's NeverDown?"  "It's your software and it would have been much cheaper to have packed a disk in with the drive so we wouldn't have to go through this!"  "NeverHeard of NeverDown."  Very cute!  "You've got to be kidding;  that's why I bought the drive.  How can an Iomega technician not be aware of Iomega software?"  "Oh, they change things all the time and never tell us anything."  "Well, what about Iomega Protection Suite?"  "You know, what I'd suggest is that you just use the Windows backup software that comes with Windows 7.  That's what I did.  No conflicts.  No hassle.  And it works."  "Are you telling me there are conflicts between the Iomega Protection Suite and Windows 7?"  "No, I'm not telling you that.  I don't know.  I do know that Windows backiup works fine."  So I'm using Windows backup until Iomega supports its own cloning software!  As for the drive itself:  it's fast, quiet and mounts without a problem ... so I'll keep it in the hopes of finding software that does what I want.

$review_text.: I purchased this product at a retail store a couple weeks ago. I bought it because I used it in the store with my iPhone 4, and it sounded awesome. When I first brought it home, it worked great. The next time I used it the remote wouldn't work. Sometimes it would change the volume or source and power on/off, but I couldn't use it to change the radio station or change the song. The same day the sound kept going out. If the iPhone or system moved at all while the phone was docked, it lost connection. So when I would change the song on my iphone (because the remote nor the buttons on the dock worked) the sound would go out.Just today I started having a hard time getting it to charge. Like other reviews, I had to push really hard to get it to charge, and it would still stop charging after a few minutes. I honestly really liked the style, and I compared the sound to my brother's Bose side by side. You couldn't even tell a difference. It's a shame it's having all these problems. I've decided not to chance it and am returning it today.

$REVIEW.: My last headphones were over-ear closed Shure SRH440's.  I'm missing the sound isolation that those provided but I generally listen in a quiet environment where I am alone, so isolation is not really an issue.  Open phones like the HD 598 have a more natural sound quality.  I'm very pleased.My SRH440's were noisy over my ears if I moved my jaw.  The HD 598's are very quiet and also very comfortable.  It is very easy to forget that you have them on.  I often wear them for hours at a time and have never removed them just because my head/ears needed a break.What I love most about the HD 598's is the great frequency response.  They are very similar to my Mackie MR-8 studio monitors.  These headphones don't seem to &#34;colour&#34; the sound.  I especially dislike the overdone bass response on certain celebrity endorsed, (and more expensive) models, so the HD 598's were a welcome addition to my work place.These are wonderful headphones for general listen or mixing.  I would choose something else if you need something for recording and require isolation.

$review_text.: From a hardware perspective, it's a work of art. Beautiful, sleek, lightweight, and solid feeling.  I got it in my hands and fell in love.  And then I tried to use it.  Which required installing SonicStage.  I'd read all the bad reviews of SonicStage, and I'd used (what I thought was) equally bad Sony software in the past -- OpenMG for their NetMD player, for example.  So I was prepared for some annoyances, fine tuning, maybe occassional bugs.  I also assumed the people who complained were exaggerating about how bad it was.  LET ME PROMISE YOU -- THEY WERE NOT.  In almost twenty years of using computer software, tinkering with electronics, owning some version of almost every gadget known to man -- I have never seen such a promising piece of hardware CRIPPLED by such a buggy, ill-conceived, underpowered, unintuitive piece of software.  It's WORSE than what people are telling you.  It's so bad that I ended up returning mine and buying an Ipod -- something I swore I'd never do.  The user interface isn't even consistent between the player and the software.  There's no way to shuffle all the songs on the drive.  User support is non-existent.  SonicStage freezes and crashes for no reason, despite being upgraded to latest version and uninstalled/reinstalled.  Certain songs won't transfer, others are marked as having no digital rights (even though they were tracks recorded from the same albums as other songs that transferred fine -- and that NEVER had digital rights assigned to them in the first place.)  A lot of people have complained about Sony forcing you to use their proprietary ATRAC3 format instead of MP3.  Honestly -- that's the LEAST of this unit's problems.  The bigger problem is that the software engineers are too incompetent to program a stable program that will actually CONVERT and MANAGE those ATRAC3's.  Sony's hardware engineers created this beautiful player, and their software engineers will be the cause of its failure.  Words cannot do justice to how badly Sony bungled this mess.  It kills me to say this, but don't waste your time.**NEW ADDITION:  To the reviewers who make comments to the effect that anyone who has problems with SonicStage software either has a faulty computer or is a complete idiot:  Have you actually tried to USE the software?  Or do you just sort of sit and stare at the pretty pictures on the screen?  (I mean, come on.  Nobody's arguing that the hardware is extremely impressive, but the software is buggy, unintuitive, and inconsistent.  It's been pretty well documented by several thousand people. I can't imagine that anyone outside of the programming group that put that mess together would actually think it's a competent piece of software, and if they do, they must enjoy spending hours in front of their computer and not have much of a social life.)  Second, some reviewers have disputed my claim that the unit cannot shuffle the entire HD.  My claim is true, it has been substantiated by a senior marketing representative from Sony with whom I have exchanged several letters and phone calls.  Yes, you can shuffle within albums (or "groups"), and you can shuffle within artists and playlists.  But you CANNOT shuffle through the entire HD as a whole.  The only way this would be possible would be to designate the entire library as a single playlist, and playlists are currently limited to 1000 tracks.  So if you have 3,000 tracks on the player, there is absolutely, positively no way to shuffle those 3,000 tracks -- only subsets of those tracks (e.g., album, group, etc.)  I suppose you could spend several extra hours of your life creating complicated playlists and shuffle between those playlists.  But on an Ipod (and, incidentally, almost every other MP3 player on the market), you simply hit a menu entry titled "shuffle."

$review_text.: This filter accessory kit for the Panasonic Lumix LX-series compact camera is a perfect example of a simple product that does one thing and does it pretty well.The LX7 camera comes with a lovely Leica-made lens. Even though the LX7 looks like a typical compact camera, the quality of its lens begs for some kind of additional protection. You want another piece of glass in front.To accomplish that, the LX7 has an outrageously expensive and bulky filter kit Panasonic sells. Or you can buy this Fotasy kit.The Fotasy beats Panasonic in that it adds a small step-up filter adapter to the end of the Lumix's lens. The lens already has a screw end, which is covered by a tiny (and sometimes hard to remove) ring that protects it.To use the Fotasy filter set, unscrew that lens ring carefully, replace it with the filter adapter, then screw the filter into the adapter. Perfect. You now have a UV filter protector in place.If there's a disappointment, it's that the new assembly can no longer use the nice Lumix lens cap. A cheapo substitute is offered in this kit. However, anyone serious about using the LX7 will consider buying a separate auto-opening lens cap anyway. (If considered, the JJC ALC-LX7BK  is specifically made deeper to work with this filter kit in place; the more commonly seen auto-opening lens cap is not deep enough. Buyer beware.)Another knock is that the instructions are anemic to a fault. The LX has a couple removable sections on the lens, and the instructions are not the clearest for which one to remove, especially since the construction of the end of the lens barrel does not appear to consist of two pieces, though it is. Worse, some instructional videos online show how to remove the OTHER lens ring, which must also be removed to install third-party auto-opening lens caps. Confusion may run high for folks not accustomed to installing odd camera accessories.As for the 37mm UV filter, it's made in Japan rather than China, so that's something in its favor. Eyeballing the glass under bright light showed no obvious defects and the coating looked fine and consistent.Overall, the kit does what it says and with decent quality. Just use a firm but careful hand when removing the ring at the end of the LX7's extended lens, and you should be OK.

I only use this for the OS and keep 2 7200rpm HDDs in the box for storage.  Nice and fast on Windows 7.  Easy install and no heat!  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the PowerGen Mobile Juice Pack to use on my Kindle Fire.Charged the pack up completely.........First attempt to charge the Fire from the battery pack resulted in the battery indicator going down to 1 bar and the Kindle Fire is still not completely charged.I like the design a lot and want this to work so bad as it would be a great solution for me.Do these things need several charge cycles to work at peak performance?I'm ready to return it if this is all it does as it's a flop.Amazon says it should provide 2-3 charges on most devices.I may try it one more time before retuning it......will follow-up with results.PowerGen External Battery Pack 5200mAh High Capacity Power Bank Charger 1A output for Apple iPad 2, iPhone 4 4s 3Gs 3G, iPod Touch / Samsung Galaxy S S2 S II, Galaxy Nexus, Epic 4G / Blackberry Torch Bold Curve / HTC Sensation 4G, XE, XL, Thunderbolt, E...Jan 19, 2012 Update:Tried charging my Kindle Fire twice more with the PowerGen (fully charged) and had the same poor results. You can't even get one full charge out of it if your Fire is down to 1/4 charge or less.The PowerGen external battery pack is NOT for use on the Kindle Fire as Amazon says it is. False advertising IMHO.I'm returning it today.

$REVIEW.: I have used this at length for a month and am very pleased with what I paid for it (&#60;$50). I really like the usb charging port, auxillary input, and the bluetooth connection. I used my GS4 and it paired with no hassle and only required some searching for an clear open radio station to get this working. I recommend scanning through the stations and finding which are completely skipped over. Those vacant ones will be the most clear to stream.The only drawback as that the quality and loudness is still just above radio quality. Although it sounds clear with little-to-no static, it could use deeper bass and stronger range of highs.

I have used it only a few times but in that course it has become very easy to use.  The actual function of the tablet is great.  The pen and tablet are pressure sensitive which I think is quite good.  Not to mention its beautiful.  Its very slim with a touch sensitive zoom button that has a ring of blue around it.  The medium tablet is quite big, and it auto adjusts to my screen which is 22" widscreen, and is great to use to take notes in your own hand writing or as I use it, to draw with art software.  The painter software is a great addition to this tablet.  This was a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone thinking of getting one.

$review_text.: Bottom line: This camera is perfect for a pro who needs a second body or an amateur looking to step up into full-frame. The cost is right, the quality is what you would expect (see below), and the pictures are stunning. Complements my 5D mkII and 40D perfectly, and seems like a reasonable merging of the two. Although a new user might feel comfortable, I would recommend this camera to those with experience in photography. Fantastic camera, glad I bought it!The details: I'm going to start with what I don't like first. Keep in mind that none of these are significant and do not affect my enjoyment of the camera a bit. They are small things that I've noticed, though. First, the build quality is slightly below what I would expect. I have no doubt that the camera is rugged, but I'm used to feeling the sturdiness of a camera in my hands. When i first picked it up, it seemed too light and plasticy to hold up to regular use and the occasional bump. But it's worked fine and the plastic is necessary for the GPS and Wi-fiSecond, although it's made by Canon, there are some small user interface differences between this and previous models. You may at first turn it on and think, &#34;Wait, where's that setting I used to love?&#34; It's there, but it's likely buried, accessed via a counterintuitive route, or on the opposite end of the camera! But, after a few minutes of messing around you'll be fine navigating all that the camera offers.So, onto the good and great:Image quality: Surprise! It is amazing. It is leaps and bounds above my 40D (likely due in part to the full frame), significantly better than my old 5D, and I would say marginally better than my 5D mk II. Obviously this last comparison is debatable and can actually be ignored entirely; both produce stunning images that are only slightly different upon unusual inspection. If you're used to a point-and-shoot or worse, your cell phone camera, you'll probably cry a little once you see the images this thing takes. They're sharp naturally, without post-processing. The exposure is sometimes a tad off, but it's still better than most bodies I've used.Low-light: I found out by accident how capable this camera was of taking low-light images. After opening the camera the night I received it, clicked the shutter by accident and was blown away by the image it produced. The ISO was not cranked to the max and the lens was not particularly open. I've added the image to show what I mean. On my previous cameras, those shadows in such low light would have been indecipherable. This is my go-to when out for an evening shoot.UI: As mentioned, there is a slight learning curve. Canon moved some things around, I think to keep up with modern conventions, so if you're coming from a previous Canon body you might have to take some time to learn where all the important settings are. But once you find them, they're easy to remember. Buttons, dials, etc., are all self-explanatory.Specs: On paper the camera is impressive. All of its features add up to a wonderful photography experience. Low-light noise handling, the autofocus, dynamic range, ISO, shutter speed, and general speed are all superb thanks to the powerful processor. The viewfinder is clear and encompassing. You can crop in-camera and the battery lasts plenty.Bells and Whistles: This thing has them. They were not a primary concern for me, but after a month of heavy use I can say I'm glad they're there. The Wi-fi and GPS enablement is a time-saver and appreciated nicety. The latter is becoming increasingly popular with online photo sites, so it's just something cool to have built-in.The magic: The processor and focus mechanisms in this thing are unparalleled. There are times where I would normally switch into manual focus to get the right feel to the picture, but this camera predicts with 90% accuracy what I intended. When shooting complex subjects with multiple textures, the camera accurately selects what I would have focused on. And beyond just focusing on faces of human subjects, it targets specifically their eyes. It's wonderful.This camera is amazing. If you've been contemplating this for a while and have had trouble justifying the cost or have been switching between this and other bodies but have yet to make a decision, but it. If you stumbled across this and are considering it for an expensive impulse buy, buy it. If you have a significant other still using an earlier body and want to help them step up their game, buy it. You will not regret it.

$REVIEW.: I ordered these to go with a Harmon Kardon receiver (AVR 1700) I found on a great clearance sale at Best Buy. They look beautiful, and I have no complaints about the sound. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I like my movies to sound good, and these are night-and-day different to listening to my television's built in speakers, or even my old hundred-dollar sound bar I bought a couple years ago at Radio Shack. I'm not advanced enough in my knowledge of good speakers to evaluate the sound quality in more fine detail than that, but I have never had a situation where I thought they were lacking.  Oh, and the fact that 5.1 surround sound includes a center channel speaker that prioritizes dialogue means that I no longer have the issue where I have to turn the movie up WAY TOO LOUD for a few seconds to hear a quiet piece of dialogue. I love that.My only complaint was the speaker wire inputs. These spring clips are cheaply made. You'll read the same thing in several other reviews on here, but I'll throw my hat into the ring on this one. Five of the six speakers, no problems. But on the second one I wired up, the clip just crumbled under my thumb as I pulled it back against its spring. I have small hands, and I was not rough with it by any stretch of the imagination. Just using the amount of muscle needed to compress the spring was too much for that particular clip.Now, Polk was great and immediately shipped out two replacement sets of spring clips (even though only one speaker was broken), along with some quick verbal instructions about how to replace them myself. I asked about taking the speaker in for service, but the shipping wouldn't have been covered under warranty, so I thought I'd take a crack at it. It sounds simple, but it was VERY difficult to get the speaker apart to replace the clips. I am posting this in the hopes that it will help someone else who has to do this in the future.The face of the speaker was easy enough to remove, as were the screws underneath the rubber seats for the posts on the faceplate (these had to be carefully removed from the speaker, by the way, before the screws were visible). However, the two halves of the speaker absolutely would not even BUDGE against each other. Trying to pry them apart with a small screwdriver was only resulting in putting gouges into the plastic of the speaker.I put in another call to Polk to resolve this, and eventually the CS rep went and got his hands on an actual speaker to take it apart. He came back and said he had the exact same problem, solved by (get this!) wrapping the speaker in a layer of cloth for protection and WHACKING IT AGAINST THE WORKBENCH! He said this loosened it right up and suggested I do the same. I got his assurance that if this broke the speaker, they would replace it for me. Then I went home and did like he said... gave it a good solid whack against my carpeted floor. And wouldn't you know it, a couple whacks and the two halves slid right apart. No damage, easily replaced the spring clips, and we're back in business. That speaker now sounds just as good as the rest. So if you have to take this apart to replace the spring clips, wrap it in something soft and strike it firmly (don't smash the heck out of it!) against a hard surface until you hear the halves pop apart.I would buy these again, but the flimsiness of the clips was a little disappointing.

$REVIEW.: This lens is sharp, fast, and autofocuses on all Nikon DSLRs
 The autofocus motor is louder than most AF-S motors, but it's not actually bothersome.Compared to the Nikon 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 (which I've borrowed), this lens is about a stop faster, doesn't make it quite as wide (only goes to 11), and, subjectively, has less distortion.This is a great wide angle lens and, due to the fast f/2.8 aperture, it is easily the best for night sky photography.

$review_text.: This bridge is very picky on how you place it

You want to face it with the side facing where the router is..


Which if you looking at it strait on, it should be the left hand side


Which would be the top of the board where the antenna are located

This will boost your signal levels a good bit.Just for the record this bridge is paired with DIR-825 router
Which will be upgraded soon to the E4200V2

Then I can test the 3 stream tech and see if signal level's improve

All testing was done on the 5GHz band, with the router being in the basement with antenna horizontal and the brige laying on it's left hand side above the router 2 floors above
Signal levels reported by TEW-680MB in the 50% range with quality in the 90% range


Rx in the 270-300 Mbit range

TX in the 160-216 Mbit range


Router reports 100% signal and 270-300 Mbit


Location is isolated, free of other wireless traffic.The manual this comes with is worthless


No website info on what the settings and readings were


If you don't use the wizzard and set up the bridge, it will change the IP of the bridge..

Making it so you can not access it again unless you reset it


Even the web address won't work.I called tech support up to ask a question and were 100% worthless

I asked what ACK failures were from and they told me from my PC


I knew it wasn't..

So I wasted 30 min on the phone with the guy from India.***Update***I did alot of research in the settings on this bridge and found that it liked channel 44 and MSC setting of 11..


Signal has jumped to 70's and now is rock solid on Link Quality at 100%.Retries for TX where 10%+ before..
After 0.005% Retry rate
Error rate was 5%+ now is 0%.Errors for RX where 5-10% before..

After 0.001% Error rate.TX @ 120 Mbits solid, RX @ 300Mbit solid.Very happy

Raised score 1 star.Still not happy with support or information on this bridge.Once tweaked this bridge is better then my DAP-1522.

$review_text.: I was sent this power bank by the manufacturers for review.  I have tried a few of their products now and, like the others, I think this one excellent. The unit has a good capacity of 5200mAh which is enough to charge most mobile phones 2 or 3 times or a tablet once - although it depends on your individual device, of course - which makes it a really useful thing to have around.It is very simple to use. Just plug the micro-USB lead supplied (or any other micro-USB lead) into a USB port and the micro-socket on the power bank and it charges at a slightly leisurely 1A.  (There is a US-style SSB charger supplied with the power bank).  It takes about 6 hours for a full charge and the level of charge is shown by the normal 4 small LEDs.  Using the power bank to charge your device is just as simple. Just plug your device's USB lead into the power bank, switch and your device will charge at pretty well the same rate as if you charged it in the normal way.The unit also has a little LED flashlight which is pretty bright and a handy thing to have in your bag when fumbling for keys on a dark night or the like.  It's a nice little bonus.This seems like a very good-quality product.  Leakage rate is very low and if the claims of 500+ charge/discharge cycles are true (which they usually are for this type of battery) that's a good long life.  It is light at 125g, robust and elegant.  It's a compact and slim at 9cm x 4cm x 2cm so it will slip pretty easily into a pocket or handbag.I really like this power bank. My one complaint is that the English in the user manual is very poor.  Fortunately it is so simple to use that this doesn't really matter, but it doesn't do justice to what is a very good product and I hope the manufacturers put this right very soon. Minor instruction niggles aside, I am very impressed. I'd baulk a little at the full list price of fifty dollars, but as I write it's offered for under eighteen, which is very good value and I can recommend it warmly.

I stopped by the local BB store and compared the new popular brands Bose and Beats. I plugged in my iPhone to each of the latest headphones that this store had available and the Sony's are way better. Not only offering sound cancelling but with the added power from the battery, the bass is amazing, rich deep sound, great mids and highs. Excellent for all music, just a really great all around headphone set. Again, I've had these for two years, and I noticed Sony had released a new version of these also with battery power, I wasn't able to test those. If they are as comfertable and great sounding as this model, they should be a great set.

$review_text.: I was looking for a larger case than what came with the Canon Power Shot A4000 camera. This case is large enough to carry extra batteries and media cards without taking up too much space. The price was right and the case is working out great. I use to carry a larger case and I always thought I didn't have to have all this equipment for short trips or outings. If you are looking for a compact case that just has enough room for the essentials this is the one.

$review_text.: It's great as a speakerphone. I've never had anyone tell me that they couldn't understand me. I love that I can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me. The FM transmitter is OK, but the audio quality is definitely not as good as plugging into my aux input. It would be nice if this had the option of a 1/8&#34; audio out (though I suppose you wouldn't want a wire hanging from your visor). In any case, great call quality, and voice commands work well.

$REVIEW.: First let me say that I paid under $10.00 for these from Amazon Warehouse. They're OK speakers. They don't give a rich sound but are clear and crisp sounding. For a laptop speaker they're good but m I was hoping to use for one of my TV's. My TV speakers are giving me a problem so I thought I'd try these but they don't work well for dialog. The power on light is very bright too. It can light up a room, so be prepared if your in a darker room. Not bad for the price though.

$review_text.: When I got it, it was VERY stiff in both panning and tilting.  After disassembling, cleaning all of the grease out, then re-assembling and using a much lighter grease, it works ok.  I bought it for a lighter gimbal for my 300 f/4 with a 1.4 or the 1.7 TC.  NOTHING at all like the Wimberley version 2 that I use with the 300 f/2.8.I think I'll probably stick with my Wimberley and put up with the extra weight.

$REVIEW.: I like using my iPad2 without an case/cover attached, so this sort of simple zip-up case is ideal for storing it while not in use, or protecting it when I'm out and about.It seems well built and well thought-out:There is a slightly fuzzy, very soft, white interior material, which seems to be very gentle on the screen. It did leave some little fuzzies on the screen at first, but that seems to be tapering down. The iPad2 fits well inside, though there is a little more wiggle room then there needs to be. (I'm guessing this is so an iPad2 with a smart cover will fit inside.) The exterior is a semi-stiff neoprene-like material, which seems to provide a lot of protection because of the sort of "corrugated" style. I have the red one, and it looks very nice. The zippers seem nice, too. Just FYI, the zipper only goes from the upper corner to near the opposite corner, which works fine.Small complaints:1. I wish there was more padding around the interior edges of the case. I have a Belkin case for Kindle that has two extra "lips" of padding all the way around the inner edges, which sort of overlap, even under the zipper. This helps with edge drops. On the iLuv, there is some of this edge padding, but it's not even close to overlapping, so the thin edges of the iPad2 can slip right between the two lips in the event of a drop, so edge drops could be more damaging.2. I wish there was some sort of small, unobtrusive accessory pocket. Even just a little "sleeve" on the outside/inside/back, where I could slip just the power cord. As it is, there's nowhere to put anything extra.Overall though, this seems to be a nice, attractive case for the price.
$SUMMARY.: Nice, Simple iPad Case

$review_text.: ZS7 gives me more than what I expect from ~$200 camera. It is an excellent camera for taking casual outdoor snapshots while I travel. It is small and light enough for carrying anywhere all day. The intelligent automatic features works well in many occasions I encounter while I travel. The GPS works as advertised. If I use it under a good condition and give it ample time to catch up, it is very accurate. It is so much fun, because it tells me the name of a landmark that I am shooting at (even if I don't know what I am looking at...). I'm sure I will appreciate even more in 5 yeas when I forget what I shot. Automatic time zone adjustment is a subtle but nice bonus that comes with the GPS. To me the battery is ok, but naturally the GPS uses power and that is something you need to pay attention. I cannot do without a spare battery on any camera anyway.Like any other camera, the camera doesn't give everything I want under all conditions. ZS7 does not give me a good pictures under poor lighting conditions. That is a fact, and you should know before you buy it - either accept the fact or look for something else. I am not complaining about it at all though, because I am quite happy with my ZS7. I just use one of other cameras when I know I want to take nice pictures under poor lighting conditions.

$review_text.: I bought this after reading about it on cnet as a good way to protect the iPad 2's backside if using the Smart Cover.  As far as installation goes, if you've ever used protectors like Zagg Invisible Shield, it's exactly the same process -- clean surfaces thoroughly before application, douse your fingers and the shield with the application fluid (seriously, be liberal with it), and work under good lighting to make sure you can see any dirt/dust particles that might fall on the surface.  I found the installation video on Bodyguardz.com helpful in order to get the corners on the backside to lie flat -- you have to wait 10-15 minutes after application and then press the corners down (on the video it says to use your palm -- I found it worked way better just using your thumb/fingers), then the corners will stick and lie flat.So far I think it's a better value than the Zagg because it has the same quality feel and thickness at a much lower price (at least when I got it).  I think the texture is a little less sticky/rubbery than the Zagg, which makes for smoother swiping across the iPad.I gave it 4-stars because ultimately I prefer the Splash Masque (I have that on our 1st gen iPad) and its no-fluid/static cling application, which is a lot less fussy and involved, and offers the same protection in my opinion (at least for what we do with our iPads).  However, I needed something for the backside that worked with the Smart Cover and would retain the nice sleek look of the iPad 2.  This certainly fits the bill, although it would be nice if they sold it just for the backside.
$review_summary.: Good value; watch the installation video

$review_text.: I love my iPad. I try to us it in place of my laptop whenever possible.  I have tried several other case/keyboard combos and didn&#8217;t like the bulk they added, or the smaller sized keys.  This is not a case for your iPad, rather it&#8217;s a case for the full size Apple Bluetooth keyboard. It snaps into the case, the case folds to cover the keyboard.  When you&#8217;re ready to use it, it folds into a stand you can set your iPad on and type away.  I have a small messenger bag I carry and it the case and keyboard don&#8217;t take up very much room. When I need to type a more than I want to deal with on the onscreen keyboard I just whip it out.The things I like most about it.1. You don&#8217;t have a bulky case for your iPad, you can use about what ever case you want since it just props the iPad up, I have a iPad Air, and use the new apple leather case for it and its fine.2. Then I have a full size keyboard. I can type fairly fast.  Using the miniaturized keyboards, it was difficult and frustrating to keep my speed up and then deal with all the typos. Having the full size keyboard is great.

All that was left was the 'bineer. It was clipped inside my jacket so I can't imagine it took a lot of stress but it failed at the first link.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this camera over 3 years ago and I was immediately impressed with it.  The picture quality was great and it was small enough that I could put it in my pocket.  That is how I typically carried it too, but always somewhat protected inside a thick soft case which was designed for eyeglasses.  This camera has gone on many trips with me, either as a backup to a DSLR or for trips where I wanted to travel light.  While the results are obviously not as good as my DSLR, but compared to other compact cameras that my friends and family have used, this one had better autofocus and better image quality.  Unfortunately after my last trip this summer the camera simply stopped working.  The lens only pops slightly out when it is turned on, there is an error message, and I have to manually push the lens back in when I turn it off.  If it was still working I would have given this 5 stars, but I have to detract one due to it's lack of durability.
$SUMMARY.: It's great while it lasts

$REVIEW.: Let me first clarify that I have had this product before (in white). The sound, range and battery life were all good but the little clips that holds the wire broke and then the wires started shredding. So when I looked to buy a new one, this one had the best review for the price and in the past I had a bad experience with Motorola. So, decided to buy two of this product (one for my partner). Then I noticed that under other buying options, there was another vender selling it at $37 with free shipping. I ordered two but later in the evening I double checked and realized it was a vender from China. Having had really bad experiences with Chinese vendors, I requested to cancel the order but the vendor claimed s/he had already shipped the product. The items arrived in LG packaging but the product is made with cheaper plastic and subtly poorer quality. The sound is low quality compare to my original LG Tone, but battery life and range are about the same as the old one. I kept them (not wanting ship back to china) and use it only for phone calls while driving and not music at all. However, I do expect it to last not as long. Will update if it breaks down.
$SUMMARY.: bought from one of the other Amazon venders from China and got a cheep replica

$review_text.: Bought these for an 84-year-old to hear the TV.  She has not tried them yet.  I attached them to my iPod and they sound great to my 56-year-old ears.  Comfortable, although (as many reviewers have noted) when you bend down you need to hold them on or slide the top to the back of your head. Super easy to set up.  Built-in male red and white RCA plugs, with extensions provided for 1/8th inch iPod style and old-school 1/4 inch guitar-amp style plugs.The headphones do need to be tuned to the signal from the base station, which is the reason for 4 stars, not 5.  For 5 years I had 4 IR earphones in a Suburban for the DVD-game player.  Little kids had nothing but problems with the tuners on the headphones.  They would try to change the volume but change the tuner and "lose the station" instead, then whine in frustration, but there was nothing I could do when I was driving.  (OK, I'm the one whining now.)  I am concerned that the 84-year-old will have the same problem.  Seems to me this is OK technology for engineers, but not for very old or young people.  It would be better to set it at a particular channel than to have the tuner infinitely variable and very, very easy to change.  (PS  I ended up taping the tuner in the Suburban.  Then I stopped using the DVD player unless someone was sitting back there who could manage the tuner situation.  And change the DVD when a movie ended.  The little kids would beg for the DVD player, but when there was no "manager" I played CDs of Laura Ingalls and Beverly Cleary stories and that worked.)That said, the RS120 headphones tuned very easily for me with no background noise walking from room to room.  I will let you know how they work for the 84-year-old.*******A month later:Well, she says they changed her life.  Best addition to her life since her dog.  She does not need to use the captions on the TV anymore.  She got a new DVD player so she can watch movies, too.  (The old player was broken, but she did not care because she could not hear it.)  She can watch TV and DVDs in the wee small hours without waking the whole neighborhood.  The earphones are a little wobbly in the holder/charger and have to be set just so or they won't charge, but this does not bother her.  There is a bright red LED light that tells you they are set in there correctly so they can charge.  She has no issues with the amount of time she can use them between charges. I don't think she has ever run out of charge.  We tuned them to the base station and put Scotch tape on the tuner wheel when we set them up for her.  She has no issues with tuning them.  The tape stayed in place.
$SUMMARY.: Sound great, easy set-up, comfortable

$REVIEW.: This mouse is everything the other reviews said it was. It is actually a bit smaller in person than it looks like in the pictures, which is a good thing since I'm using it with a laptop. It feels very natural to hold, and there is good feedback from each click. My only complaint is that the mouse wheel needs to be pressed fairly hard to click, but it seems to be breaking in well after a week of use. Most people don't use the middle click button much anyway, so it is hardly a drawback. I will definitely purchase this mouse again when I need another one.

You will need to carry both batteries fully charged to get about the same time (maybe a little more) than the battery that comes with the SL1.

$REVIEW.: Bought a pair of these speakers for an attic loft space driven by a Sherwood 4105 receiver.  Great match, great sound, works well with the Mediabridge miniplug to phone jacks adapter.  This allows any computer output to be used as a stereo input.The sound is exceptionally clean, clear, with more bass than meets the eye from these speakers, which easily blend in and disappear even in a relatively small space.  Work great alone or as satellites for a subwoofer or five channel system.  Sweet sounding, you won't be disappointed.
$SUMMARY.: Great bookshelf speaker

$review_text.: While I primarily use this monitor for working remotely and home computing.  I have been an avid flight sim enthusiast since 1992.  The black levels are not ideal for gaming (night flying, etc),  no LCD based panel is great at this, even an LED LCD.  What I do love is the color accuracy of this monitor.  My preferred setting is with the color temp set to 5700K.  Most users are used to higher color temperatures such as 9300K but if you are looking for a more realistic color pallet, 5700K is very life-like.  I cannot believe the difference it is making in every-day computing (web forms, applications, etc.).  Most of all, the scenery in Microsoft Flight Simulator X looks amazing!!!  Pair this monitor up with a high end graphics adapter via DVI-D or DisplayPort and you will not be disappointed.  For everyday computing, I have this monitor connected via DVI-D to an NVIDIA 210 adapter.  For flight simulation, I have the monitor connected to an NVIDIA GTX 275.  As a bonus, the monitor has a built-in USB hub which is very convenient for connecting MP3 players, USB drives, etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase!

$REVIEW.: Not too much to say, works as it should to convert USB to the old PS2 connectors

Nice that it did both KB and Mouse although you can  do just do one if you wish


I tried feeding this cable to another converting cable, from PS2 to the very old IBM PC larger round connector so I could use my favorite old IBM clickity clack KB but even though when I plugged it in my PC said installing drivers and it completed successfully, the KB did not work :( I kind of had my suspicions that the 1986 KB would work on my 2014 Dell but I thought it wouldn't hurt to try

My &#34;guess&#34; is the old KB just takes too much power for the new PC, just a guess though


This converter does allow me to use a older slightly less clickity clack PS2 KB with my Dell.

$REVIEW.: The unit itself is pretty simple.  To get it to function, of course, you must know how to make the correct assignment on your Denon AVR.  I found it was easy to install on my Denon 1909.  Accessing features on the iPod, such as shuffle songs, however, must be made through the AVR menu, which is counter-intuitive and cumbersome.  Also, graphics do not show on your monitor/screen, only text.  So you are unable to view album covers.  The text is primitive--if you are old enough to remember DOS commands, then you'll know what I mean when I say that the fonts resemble those ancient DOS commands, but they are more block-like.Also note that it is possible to connect an iPod to a Denon AVR without a dock using standard RCA cables, but then it isn't possible to control the iPod through the remote.

$review_text.: I bought this mouse for my GF as it was on sale in amazon for less than 50% than what most retailers ask for it.It is a nicely design mouse with good tracking and response (comparable by any means to the Logi Nano VX I use for my laptop) and the silent left and right buttons are VERY silent and responsive. Ergonomicaly I could say that the mouse is slightly superior to the Nano VX, but that could be subjective up to some point.It's nice that it utilizes an AA battery and a micro receiver. Both of those are ensuring long running time and high portability. Keep in mind that many of the laptop/netbook USB ports out there are NOT as deep as the nano receivers' plug length implies (1/2" ~ 12mm for both MS and Logi receivers) - and that means that in most machines out there the receiver's metal plug does not go all the way in the socket - some allow for 1/8"~2mm to stick out adding to the receivers length when pluged, some for even more.Real drawbacks? The mouse feels cheap (actually it was cheap, so no complains, but I would not pay the $49 asked by many retailers), but what really ruins the overall impression is the middle mouse button "clicking" action...it's - simply put -  terrible. Enough for ppl like my GF using it with middle-click intensive apps like SketchUp and ACAD/Revit to dislike and not use it.

$review_text.: In recent years the thickness of extension cables has been decreasing, BUT this one is extremely (shockingly) thin. . .the actual wires inside the cable must be Hair Thin.  AND one can't tell how thin the cable is from the picture.  I bought some extension cables 2 or 3 months ago and they were thin, too, but still twice as thick as this.I just received this one and it works OK so far, but my experience with such thin wires in earphones, earplugs, etc... is that they last weeks, not years.  Luckily the application I bought this for is low stress.  I am just running it to where I want to use it, plugging in the two ends and never moving it. . .Hopefully the wires won't break just under their own weight lying on the floor -- BUT you never know.( And you know, with this cheapo Chinese stuff people say you get what you pay for.  BUT the reality is that in the quantities the makers purchase materials in, the difference between 25 feet of THESE wires and wires  2,  3  or even  4  times thicker is probably fractions of pennies.  Why don't they just do it right ? )If you plan on moving this cable around or otherwise stressing it even lightly, I would NOT trust it to last very long.

$REVIEW.: This is for use on Macintosh; I haven't tried to use this on Windows PCs or other types of systems.Pros: Cheap, works fine when it works.Cons: Unhelpful support if it doesn't work, somewhat questionable future-proofing.Summary: Cheap enough to buy and throw out if it stops working.As of today, this works fine on most Macs but not on some: any Mac running a 64-bit kernel will not see the device at all. TrendNet does not seem to think this is a problem. There is a work-around (see below) if you're technically inclined, but this doesn't fill me with confidence in TrendNet's Macintosh support.This device is half the price of its main competition. If you know what you're doing, it's money well saved. If you want "just works" on a Mac, you may want to consider alternatives.On the upside, it actually provides enough power for serial-port-powered devices (such as the GC-IRL) to work reliably.The Technical Detail: The official TrendNet device driver for Mac does not have a 64-bit version. This means that any Mac that runs a 64-bit kernel will simply not see this device. TrendNet support will give you the run-around and tell you it's all your fault (system too old, system too new, whatever they can think of) but apparently won't understand what "64-bit driver" actually means. It turns out that they simply re-package the driver from their chipset manufacturer; if you're lucky, they will finally point you at prolific.com.tw, which has a perfectly fine 64-bit driver for Snow Leopard that works without problems.

$review_text.: I purchased this product to be installed under my LCD tv, on the wall. I am glad that I ordered this product because I am able to hide wires behind the wall plate that it comes with. I was originally going to run wires through the drywall but I realized that my house's construction of the exterior walls does not allow for enough room to pass the wires through.Like I said, easy assembly and the size of the glass shelf is large enough for my combo DVD VHS player. The glass seems to be of really good quality. It is tempered for safety. It is tinted.I mounted this into my wood wall studs.The only thing that you have to keep in mind when mounting this to the wall and lining it up with your TV is that it will not be centered with the TV. I installed mine under the right hand corner of the TV. This is because the wall studs are 16 inches apart. The mounting bracket for the TV cross 2 studs. If you are going to mount this into a stud, it can't be centered under the TV in this scenario. You can take the chance and use the drywall anchors to mount it differently, but I wouldn't. Comes with all the hardware that you would need.

$REVIEW.: I purchased a used unit from a local pawn shop, and it works great. Everything functions as it should and the led lights within the speaker mesh look really sharp. I can't believe the difference it makes over the basic TV speakers. When I shut off this unit and put on the TV sound it sounds sick and I can't believe I listened for years. I would urge you that, unless you're TV has some type of high end sound, to purchase this or a similar unit.As for the BUT, well, I wish I had more control over the sound like maybe a 10 band graphic EQ. Granted that would make a complex piece of equipment more complex and expensive, but I watch a lot of basketball and the squeak of sneakers on a hardwood floor drives me nuts as reproduced on a Hi-Fi unit such as this. The pounding of the ball on the hardwood floor sounds and feels realistic with the sub-woofer and makes my TV experience better.Another factor that delayed my purchase was that when I had a full surround sound system there seemed to be a delay between someone's lips moving and hearing the voice. Between an object hitting the floor and hearing the sound. This unit has a slight delay compared to TV sound, but maybe I could adjust.

$review_text.: The camera dolly is a simple, yet elegantly executed product. The box contains the dolly itself, a carry bag, and three adapters which let you attach a Joby gorillapod.The dolly itself consists of a sturdy plastic plate with three arms that can be folded for transport and quickly tightened into the extended position for use. At the end of each arm is a small elastomer wheel mounted on an adjustable axis. You can turn the wheel at any angle; the angles are identified by a letter printed on a ring. You can arrange the angle of the individual wheels to set the course of your dolly, which does not have to travel along a straight line but can also describe an elegant circle around your subject, or rotate in place.At the center of the platform, you will find a standard camera thread mount.The tip of the arms, just above the wheel, feature a clip where you attach the gorillapod adapters (supplied). That's a really convenient feature which allows you a lot of flexibility with the positioning of your camera.This little dolly really comes in handy and I'm constantly thinking of new uses for it: panoramas, taking pictures of items for ebay... It's a very creative tool, and it's not built like a throw away gadget but like a real proper tool.

$REVIEW.: Bought this as a second body back-up and now use it more than my primary. If you don't need all of the bells and whistles, weather proofing, this is the perfect camera. In the Canon lineup it lives between the pro equipment and the enthusiast stuff, so for just a great carry camera and all around fun rig, it's terrific. The flip-out screen sold me on this and now that I have it, everything else seems primitive. The one thing I didn't expect to utilize as much as I now do is the built in level in the viewfinder and for low light shooting, it's a must-have. The one big drawback to this camera is the focus on live-view is slow and clumsy, but for what I do (timelapse and night photography), it's rarely an issue. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.

I could not get this remote to work with my Canon 60D beyond about 5 feet in daylight, maybe a little farther at night.  If you were considering this remote for shooting group photos from 20 or 30 feet away, forget it. If you just need a hands-off shutter release, there are wired units available, typically with 3 feet of cable, that cost 1/4 as much and don't require a battery, so they are more reliable.

$review_text.: It is a good looking remote, works well, and easy to setup
The computer software (Web based) was easy to use and it identified every equipment we owned


I had trouble specifying our Samsung HD receiver, but I could eventually make the software identify it by trying different paths.The biggest problem I experienced is with controlling the satellite receiver from the bedroom

Let me explain


We have one of those receivers with built-in DVR and can feed programming to multiple TVs in different rooms
One box feeds multiple TVs
So, the remote for the bedroom is special in that it doesn't need line of sight for controlling the box (or DVR)


Harmony 650 doesn't support that and hence we can't use it in our bed room.It works well in our living room and controls every equipment, but requires a little learning


So, family members still want to use individual remote controls which they are familiar with


Let us see how long it will take me to motivate them to abandon other remotes and embrace Harmony 650.

$REVIEW.: This is also my first review of a product.  I was really looking forward to this laptop and when I received it and turned it on I was pretty disappointed.  The display on this laptop is very poor.  The contrast ratio is low, so everything looks a little washed out.  Its not terrible and would be tolerable but the horizontal viewing angle is horrible!  You have to get the angle perfect to make the display look acceptable.  If you move it slightly towards or away from you, it looks discolored and is pretty much unusable.  I have owned several laptops over the last couple years from a 13 dell xps to 18.4 inch hp hdx and I have never had a problem with or complained about a display before.  I've never even considered examining a display because I'm not that picky, but that was the first thing (and only thing really) that stood out through all of my time using the laptop.  The only reason I'm writing this review is to caution people about the display.  If it is not that important to you than this is a great laptop.  It's speedy, fairly well made, great battery life, relatively thin and light, and windows 7 rocks.  If the display was better it would get 5 stars.  If I had the choice to return this laptop for a full refund I would, only because of the display.NOTE: I also have asus eee pc 105ha and it has a much better display than this laptop for contrast and viewing angles.**UPDATE**  I feel the need to clarify this because I have received a few comments with tips or information about this display.  I have owned and used many laptops of all brands, price ranges, manufacturers etc... This is a BAD display, it's not just my subjective opinion.  Here is a link with actual data on the subject= [...]I'm not saying this laptop is bad, I gave it three stars, but Asus absolutely skimped on the display!

$review_text.: This is my third Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combo

I bought the first years ago, and it died just before the warranty ran out
Logitech sent me a free replacement with very little hassle


Good customer service is important to me, so I decided to stick with the brand when the replacement finally died.The new model seems to fix just about all the minor problems I had with the first one
I love the compact feel and the low profile keys
The mouse is even faster and more accurate

Best of all, I've been using it for months on the original batteries (which was my main complaint for the first one)


Keyboards and mice are very personal items, but this one is exceptionally comfortable to me.One minor nag: the mouse can be switched between &#34;freewheel&#34; and &#34;click: mode using a small button behind the wheel

I love the feel of freewheel, but it is very difficult to locate the cursor accurately - it always seems to &#34;recoil&#34; just a bit when you try to stop
It's hard to explain, but when you're scrolling down a page, for example, and you stop, it scrolls back up a few lines before it comes to rest

As a result, I leave it in click mode (which functions exactly as the previous mouse did)

If it didn't have this one annoying problem, it would be practically perfect.

$REVIEW.: I would rate this product 4 on 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to. I have used it on the first generation Aluminium Unibody Macbook. There IS definitely loss of sharpness and contrast but that is a trade-off for getting excellent protection from glare.This product is missing five stars because I found it didn't not stick properly. The glue has left some patch marks in places which is visible when the screen is turned off.

Turns out, the preload is out of date and didn't work with a Model B!  What is the point if you have to format and load NOOBS on there except for the cool Raspberry Pi logo adapter, which just differentiates this from my other cards.

$REVIEW.: So my review is based solely on the media streaming features of this unit.  I don't watch enough "physical" disks to have that aspect make a difference to me.I currently have this unit and a Sony BDP-BX58 that I have tested side by side.I have 3 media servers running on my Home network for testing:Windows Home Server 2011Mezzmo Media ServerWindows 7 Media SharingThe Sony will load everything the Windows servers see and play them just fine.  The Panasonic will load the files but takes forever to get going and is very sluggish.Mezzmo will transcode files that the Windows Servers don't recognize (things like MKVs, etc).  The Sony sees everything Mezzo has and plays them back smoothly and quickly.The Panasonic can "see" the same files on mezzmo but freezes up when you try to play them (get a few seconds of playback then nothing).Everything is connected via a hardwired Cat5 network, so there's no excuse for bandwidth, etc. when it comes to the Panasonic's poor performance.I did update the firmware on both units to the latest versions.I suspect Panasonic is either new to the media streaming world or tossed it in this unit last minute.  A good indicator is on Page 32 of the manual.  It talks about "Network Drive Connection" but tells you to visit a Panasonic website for instructions.  The website it sends you too is a "generic" support site with zero information on this topic.  I spent over an hour on the phone with Panasonic tech Support and they are clueless to this "feature" as well.If you're looking to do a lot of media streaming and want maximum versatility, I highly suggest checking out the Sony instead.

$REVIEW.: This product worked very effectively -- for less than a day. The display is very clear and it automatically finds open stations, which can be helpful (though I was able to do better in just a minute or two manually). It holds the iPod nicely and has adaptors for lots of models. The controls are intuitive, too. All in all, it seemed very well designed.The problem is the way in which it mounts into the cigarette lighter. There's a rubber gasket that's attached to the front of the plug, which is designed to hold the thing firmly in place. But that gasket makes it almost impossible to remove the Tunebase without nearly tearing the socket out of the dash. This is exactly what happened with us when we wanted to adjust the positioning of the Tunebase. And in the course of pulling the thing out -- just once -- the Tunebase somehow got fried and the channel display stopped working.And so, it went back.Unfortunately, we can't use a cassette adapter because we don't have a working cassette player in this particular car. So now, with the Tunebase off the list, we're probably going to install a new radio -- with a line input jack. That has the potential to sound better and won't be yet another RF source near the  driver's body.

The LEDs on the unit are really bright, so you know if and which way data is going


This cable is good for really simple/minimal setups, but if you're trying to sync a bunch of things, you may have to go for a higher end usb-midi cable to have it all work.

$REVIEW.: I did a lot of research on blue tooth speakers after seeing the jam box at a neighbors.The JBL Charge sounds great, holds a charge and allows me to charge my iPhone in a pinch


People that have heard this have liked it more than the small jam box.The volume is great and for the size it puts out a decent level of treble and base that surprised me for the size
The sound is very clear and can fill a room


Very easy to setup and pair with my phone

All you need to do is hold down the button to turn it into pairing mode, open up blue tooth on your phone and it pairs


Who you want to use it, just turn it on and it automatically pairs with the phone and stars playing the music
Be aware this allows for only one device to be paired to at a time.Understand what you are buying, this is not a $500 set of speakers and is just the size of a 16 oz can of beer, so you can only expect so much sound from it.We bring this with us when we go places and bring it outdoors when we want music outside.I liked this so much I bought one for my dad for his birthday and he loves it too.

$review_text.: Out of the box, this tablet is useful for e-mail, Pandora, viewing photos, and maybe some videos
 You have access to some market apps, but not the full android market

 And some of the apps you can get don't really work well on a tablet


 For example, the free spider solitaire app uses cards sized for a phone, and just spreads them out so far on the screen you actually have to turn your head to check for plays


 Video is a chancy business with fewer working than not working


 When they do work, they look good
 The screen, other than having a narrow viewing angle, is very good


 But it does show fingerprints easily


 I put on a Skinomi screen saver, and it helps


 Expect to use the internet for info often as you start trying expand your use of this tablet
 XDA developers is a very good resource, and has links to other resources


 Don't expect to just pick it up and use it as a laptop or netbook replacement right away, but it can come close after some research and effort.

$review_text.: I already had a Canon 17-40mm lens for my 6D as well as a 70-300mm, but I needed a general-purpose &#34;walking around&#34; lens

The 28-75mm range on this Tamron fit the bill, and the reviews were generally good.I have to agree with them: this is a great little lens at a very good price

Focus is fast and accurate, and relatively quiet

DoF when wide open and at close range is very narrow, as expected, but lets you get images that might otherwise need extra light or extra-high ISO with the associated noise issues

The lens is well-built but not overly heavy

Manual focus, when I need to use it, is smooth but not too loose; this is the 'feel' that I prefer so I don't move past the right spot too easily
Image contrast is good, and images are realistic, without being overly warm/cool or saturated.Unless I know I'm going to need the more extreme ranges of my other lenses, this one stays on the camera.

$review_summary.: Highly recommended for Canon 6D

$REVIEW.: I've purchased 2 of these chargers because they work quite effectively
They also come with an extra USB charging cable that works flawlessly with your iPhone 3G or 3GS


The main car charging unit has a female USB connector as well as a handy replacable fuse just in case you connect it to the wrong voltage or it just wears out.You must be very careful when selecting a car charger for either your iPod Classic, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, iPod Touch, iPhone, iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS because each and every product has a slightly different voltage that is not necessarily compatible with every charging unit


I went through 3 chargers before I found this one and it performs flawlessly!To ensure that the car charger is effectively charging your iPhone or iPod, pay attention to the charging icon in the upper righthand corner of the screen

If the icon shows a battery with a lightning symbol in it for longer than 5 minutes, you can be assured it's charging properly

However, if it shows a plug-in symbol within the charging icon either immediately after you try charging it or after a few minutes, you can be assured that it is NOT compatible nor is it charging your device.Be aware that if you are charging your iPhone 3G or 3GS and using it heavily, like talking to someone on the phone while surfing the internet, or playing music while using Google Maps, the charging icon in the upper righthand corner will eventually display the plug-in symbol that indicates it's no longer charging
Be sure not to use the device heavily when you're charging it in your vehicle


For example, a phone call doesn't constitute heavy usage as it's one function being utilized at a time

More than one function operating, however, is not recommended when charging in your vehicle.

$REVIEW.: The ONLY relative negative to this tripod is that it's rather expensive for a tiny tripod. Roughly double to triple the trivial price tripods in the tiny genre demand. This, however, isn't much of a concern if you're more than just a casual hobbyist. In all honesty, I use this tripod more than I do my other tripods, and that includes my $500 carbon Manfrotto. It is easily my least expensive tripod and I use it the most by far.This, in my opinion, is a professional's secret weapon for backpacking/camping/travel/difficult-to-get-to locations without a crew. If you must pack light, really light, this tripod is a lifesaver for light to medium-weight gear as you otherwise wouldn't be packing ANY tripod.My main initial concern with this pod was how well the tiny ballhead would do with a medium SLR on it. Um, REALLY WELL, that's how! :O I even put my D700 with 28-300 on it and it holds like a champ at all angles and is SMOOTH. Now, this has got to clearly be right at the limit of what this little pod is rated or limited at, but who is really going to load such a tiny pod up with such heavy gear? My D7000 with 18-200 (yes, different rig from D700 with 28-300 but still of heft) is held just fine on it. When using full-size SLRs though, a more stable tripod would be preferred. For point and shoots, this head is way overkill.The leg quick-release levers are strong and smooth and work great. All other controls hold very well though the neck's screw never really seems tight and this could lead to overtightening. Moderate screw tightness combined with the neck's barrel tightener provide solid neck locking.You have to understand that such a light tripod will by physical nature not be real steady and fall victim to breezes. This will be true of every tiny/lightweight tripod, not just this one. If you're shooting with the legs extended, you will want to use your self-timer so that you don't cause vibration by pressing the shutter button with your finger. If your camera can take a cable release or  has a remote control release, USE IT. Hanging a little weight on the tripod (camera and hanging weight combined should TOTAL about 5 pounds) or gently pressing down on the base would help also.Now, it does not get very tall. I assume you know this since you're looking at tiny tripods and that this is okay with you. You'll be shooting from around waist-level without extension or chest level with full extension. As long as this does not limit you, you'll love this tripod. If you need a full-height tripod, none of this tripod's virtues will matter.My criteria for this (my casual hiking/travel) tripod was that with head it be under 2 pounds and not more than 18 inches when compacted. This tripod met that criteria coming in 1/4 pound lighter and 4 full inches more compact than my very exclusive criteria. It is the ONLY tripod of any quality to meet that criteria and though I was ready make a lot of sacrifices to meet such stringent criteria, I really got GREAT quality and respectable stability! This tiny ballhead holds tilt positions stronger than my $150 Manfrotto 327RC2 grip head. I'm not exaggerating at all. The 327RC2, relying on spring pressure to grip the ball, actually will slip with heavier gear that the Slik Mini II clamp ballhead will hold. My D700 with 28-300 is the perfect example. That rig is really too much for the 327RC2 at tilt angles but this little clamp ballhead will hold the position.I permanently leave mine in my light hiking/travel backpack with my waterproof point and shoot (Lumix TS2)... because you never know when that once-in-a-lifetime rainbow or flower shot or great background for a self-portrait will present itself. 80 bucks for lots of photos you otherwise wouldn't get. Money well-spent. :)Seriously, if you need a tiny tripod, you're not going to do better than this one. You're not. I truly have to repeat this: you will NOT find a better tiny tripod than this one. Period. Even if you spend more. More expensive alternatives come in bigger and heavier. This is the tiniest and lightest with such impressive capabilities. It is an ideal travel tripod that you can actually take around with you because of its size and weight. Anything bigger/heavier becomes burdensome. Anything smaller is a TOTAL joke and doesn't even do a good job holding tiny point and shoots and keep your fingers crossed that it doesn't break after first use. Even other tripods around this size are total garbage that don't function well and break in no time. This is a SMART, very well-designed purposeful tripod designed to be used and used and used by photographers! Its tiny size, its greatest attribute, means that you actually WILL be packing a tripod when you otherwise wouldn't be. Like I said, mine's in my backpack taking up next to no space and I don't even know it's there... until I need it. ;)

$review_text.: So I had some extra cash and looked for sound bars in the sub $100 range that might be worth buying (most in this range aren't)  I happened to stumble upon this unit for $115 with $25 shipping on here
Determined to get a better deal, I did a massive google search and found this sound bar atTarget for just $89.The sound is incredible, and I have it in a large living room
 Really has given my old sony 46 inch lcd projection tv a boost to its sound, and it's very low profile not extending past the small base my tv has

 Virtual surround really does give the room a movie theater feel when watching a movie


As for the build quality, it seems to be built pretty well
 The finish matches my tv perfectlyBut it's not perfect
 Controlling the unit is terrible
 There are no buttons whatsoever on the unit so if you loose the remote, your sound bar is essentially bricked


 Speaking of the remote, the remote is also terrible


 It's about the size of a car stereo remote and takes a gigantic watch battery


 The remote has options to turn up and down bass and treble, but on that note the only visual indicators that the unit is even turned on are led lights on the top back of the unit and you can't see them sitting down

 No way to indicate where your volume or bass levels are at

 Really wish they would of put a front facing LED display like the Vizeo's have.Also good luck with programming your universal remote

 I have AT&T; Uverse and I've tried every phillips code for every device they have listed and no dice

 Going to the AT&T; support forums, only answer I got was "buy a logitech harmony"
 Now I'm pricing those, confirmed to work with some searching, which I really didn't want to do, but I hate the little remote with it, as much as I hate having 20 remotes lying around.So I'm giving it 4 stars, even though realistically the control situation might deserve another star subtracted

 Reason being because they sound for the price is incredible
 But beware, control is a total pain.

$review_text.: I mislaid the cable for my Nexus 7 tablet and needed a replacement. The old one had been inconveniently short. Looking around on Amazon I found cables in usual Army sizes -- too long, or too short. So I bought this one, and it works fine, a perfectly good cable that accomplished both charging and data transfer, and hangs down far enough to have a puddle of excess cable on the floor.

$review_text.: I guess you can't criticize sound quality too much on headphones that retail for $5. For the record, though, these RP-HT21s are slightly below par compared to the similar headphones that came with my 2003 Panasonic SL-SX420 MP3 CD player, sounding a bit less strong and detailed. Also, the foam padding flaked off quicker, and I find the earbuds to be angled inward a few degrees too far, falling short of a perfect fit.So yes, there is some degree of variance in basic headphones, even of the same size and brand.  Undemanding ears should find them perfectly fine, though, and if they fit you better than me, it's easy to call them a good deal.

$review_text.: I bought the 6 TB version. This is one of the most disappointing products I have ever purchased. The unit crashes every few weeks for no obvious reason (you really want your NAS to never crash). It is pretty loud - lots of drive and fan noise even when there is no active transfer of files. The unit runs hot - typically reports 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Disk transfers are so slow I gave up on using it for backups. I keep hoping that a firmware change will fix things - so far 4.0.4.14600 is still not helping.I loved the idea of this device - really unhappy with the results.

$REVIEW.: The picture clarity on this tv is amazing, the 240hz really makes a difference! I am using a PS3 as this tv does not have 2D to 3D converting.I have played four 3D demo games and 3 of the 4 had a significant ghosting, even after trying to switch the 3D modes (top-bottom, side-side)
You still get the 3D effect; but if I had to choose between playing in crisp 2D and double visioned semi 3D, I would choose to play in 2D


The 4th demo called Super Stardust HD had no ghosting whatsoever and in one word the graphics in this game was simply breathtaking! I suspect this is because this games does not have a wide array of depths like the other demos (2 racing, the other is a block game).Also, there is a slight input lag while in 3D game mode

This lag is no where near as severe as when you are not in game mode (ie auto, movie, sports) but it is noticeable


This can be particularly detrimental when you are playing fighting/action games when perfect timing is crucial


As of right now (December 2010), Prince of Persia is the only 3D action game I know of(I have not played this game in 2D or 3D)

The easiest way to see this lag is with the Move controller


When you are moving the controller from left to right (not particularly fast), the screen will show the controller to the right when the physical controller is already to the left.One thing about the Move controller is that you will always see a brightly colored floating orb reflection on this tv


Learn to ignore it
There is nothing that can be done about the beautiful gloss finish.A small note about this tv being an edge lit LED tv: when the screen turns all black, the upper middle portion of the tv is not as dark as the rest of the tv

This is not a problem during actual game play.All in all, this tv is huge, slim, has almost blur free images (still cannot compare to a plasma, obviously) and has great invisible speakers

The ambient light sensor is great, no excessive eye strain! Even if you don't use the 3D features, the picture clarity and the price are unbeatable (in my totally "unbiased" opinion).Please check out my review for the 3D glasses:Toshiba FPT-AG01U 3D Glasses, Black.

$review_text.: I have been nothing but impressed with this receiver.  Don't let it's small form factor fool you, it is packed full of goodness!  I went from an Onkyo TX-SR805, which I like very much by the way, to this due to space constraints I have in my new setup.  The Onkyo was way to big, especially height wise, and it weighs a ton.  This fit the bill.  I had trouble deciding between this model and the NR1504 but decided to spend the extra for the 7.1 and 4k pass through/upscale.I was worried when I got this receiver because of the reduced power of the onboard amp.  I was going from 130 watts/ch with the Onkyo to 50 watts/ch with this.  My worries were unfounded as this receiver's amp puts out clean power providing crisp audio which no shortage on volume.  I've got it hooked up to two Polk Rti12, two Fxi5. and an Csi5.  These Polk speakers are efficient, but can handle way more power than this amp is rated to put out but it is unnecessary as they just sound fantastic with the NR-1604!  I have since bi amped the Rti12 speakers, but I can't say I notice a difference--just thought I would try it since I am not using back surround speakers.I am still exploring all of its functionality but I am just very satisfied and so glad I chose to buy the Marantz.  It's on screen menus are easy to follow.  It has all the inputs I need and leaves off so much I never used with my previous receiver.  It has preouts for another zone, a sub, and for front speakers which is really all most need.  Front left and right speakers are the only speakers in a setup likely to be big and be able to do more with a quality powerful dedicated amp.  But as I found out, give the 50watts/channel a try, I think you'll be quite impressed.It has many features that I have not discussed obviously, but you can research and easily explore them.  Trust me, you will not regret this purchase.  Go Marantz!

$review_text.: I believe this accessory perform the job for what it was designed for
 This not a "stabilizing" shoulder mount, but a stabilizer when sitting on its feet or to use the handle to the side to better grip the camera

 It was a lot easier to use the handle than the hand grip which forces you to crock your wrist to keep the camera level


 I use the handle with the Canon HF G20, on and off the tripod this weekend, with a shotgun mike on top


 I like the mike better on the top of this handle than mounted on the shoe on the camera

 I personally do not like all the weight of a shock mounted mike putting on that pressure on the case of the camera

 The top shoe can be position in any direcction.If the camera mount screw is too long, I would suggest grinding down the end to shorten the amount of threads rather than use washers in between the base and the camera
Shorten the threads allows the camera bottom to fit flush on the bottom to the mount, providing a better grip.

$REVIEW.: I only owned this camera for one night, so all I can give it is one star
 After taking a few snapshots, which looked good on the LCD, it froze
 Don't know why


 After getting it powered down by pulling the battery, I tried again
 Took a couple of shots and it blinked off

 The screen relighted momentarily with the code E16 displayed


 Went through several repetitions before calling it a night


 Recharged battery the next morning, hoping it was just a battery or memory card problem
 At that point it was unusable


Called Canon (Saturday morning)
 After a short discussion and talk through, the tech said, "Your camera is defective."  That was enough for me

 I returned it via Fedex for credit, and now I'm looking for something else because when I tried to find out about E16, I found out about E18  I don't know how many "E"s they have (at least 18, I guess), so I don't think it's a good idea to try another one of these little jewels

 It's a shame though


 I loved the design, and I think the photos would have been nice
 Perhaps the Sony Cybershot or the Casio is a little better quality
 Maybe the Olympus

 The new Nikon S4 looks great, but it doesn't look pocket-sized, so I'm floundering here.

$review_text.: While I have no qualms with the actual sound capability of this Fidelio speaker dock, it is fairly large and works for Android phones only (through dock & play or via Bluetooth). I like that it can charge the phone but I prefer to use the Bluetooth technology so I can control it from a distance. For essentially the same price, you can get the Jambox by Jawbone -- which is Bluetooth compatible with any nearly device (Android, iPhone, Blackberry, PC, Mac, etc.) There is no future-proofing w/this purchase unless you will be strictly Android person for the rest of your life. The Jambox is smaller and yet provides better sound. It's also sure to have better re-sale value if you decide to pick a different option in the future. This product operates as it should, it just isn't the best way to spend your money on this type of product (unless you really love Androids and really must have your phone be able to charge while jamming out to your music).

$review_text.: This is one of the most advanced routers in the market for home users

Lots of features, easy to set up (~20min) and a very cool texture on top of it
The antennas have several positions if you want to put those


As far as i can see a great coverage area, having in mind that i live in a 2 story house with concrete walls

Runs warmer than most of the routers but in an acceptable range, nothing serious
One thing to keep in mind is the brightness of the different led's (lan1,2,3,4, etc) they are very very bright,1.2 meters above the ground they lit up the ceiling pretty good (~2.8 meters total)
Some features are not working correctly but i just need to sit down and figure those out myself (i.e
IP reservation on the DHCP)

I will give it 5 stars because 20 minutes can't be taken to get the full view of the capabilities of this puppy


I will update if anything goes wrong

Oh, BTW some users was reporting the ongoing "There's a new firmware update" message and nothing happened, seems to be fixed cause I did look for new firmware and now it says "Your firmware is up-to-date".

$REVIEW.: THE QUICK TAKE:  The Joby GorillaPod Micro Tripod is a well-designed, well-built and reasonably priced accessory that will add significant flexibility to your photography.  While you might not always have it "Always On", it's well worth owning and carrying.GIVE YOURSELF MORE OPTIONS:  A good micro tripod gives you some very useful options with smaller to medium sized cameras, of all types:- YOU CAN BE IN THE PICTURES:  Don't leave everyone wondering whether you were actually on the trip.  A good, small tripod lets you use the self timer to include yourself in photos, and actually get good pictures.  (That is, not pictures like the ones where you put the camera on the table at lunch and set the timer, and cut off half the heads in the group.)- GET SHARP EXPOSURES:  In low light situations, you can use the tripod and the self timer to take excellent photos with long exposures without flash.  With careful handling, the camera will be still while the shutter is open.  Even the simplest camera will usually give remarkably good pictures if you can keep the camera still while it's shooting the photo.Similarly, even on bright days, you may want to use a tripod and the self timer to take photos of landscapes, to hold the camera perfectly still and get a really sharp photo of a detailed landscape.- LESS INTRUSIVE VIDEO:  I've used a mini tripod for a small video camera while talking to relatives about family history.  It's much a more natural conversation than holding the camera myself - cameras can be so distracting, for both the subject and the photographer.  If the camera has a remote that makes it a little more manageable, but with careful setup you can film without a remote.WELL DESIGNED AND WELL BUILT:  They've clearly put a lot of thought into designing the Micro 250 tripod to be compact without sacrificing usability.  I like the way the three legs fold together into one.  And, they've built it so it works.  For example, the ball joint on the head that lets you tilt the camera holds it well, so it stays where you set it.You can buy a mini tripod for a couple bucks, and it may be better than none at all.  But the Joby is much nicer to use, and won't let you down the way cheaper ones will.USE IT CREATIVELY:  With a little thought you can cope with a lot of situations and cameras.  For example, one of my Sony cameras is a heavier point and shoot, with the tripod mount at one end of the camera.  (What were they thinking?)  The Joby tripod has no trouble holding it up, as long as I'm careful to run one of the legs of the tripod under the camera to keep the weight of the camera from tipping the tripod.ALWAYS ON?  I'm a minimalist about what I carry, so there are a lot of times when I won't bring the tripod.  I don't really need it for kid's birthday parties and so on.  But it's useful to have the "Always On" design when traveling, because the truth is I won't remember to take it out of my bag and carry it or use it.  So for sight-seeing, when I'm willing to carry a little more, the GorillaPod Micro 250 is a great accessory.TRIPLE TRIPODS?  I own a full size tripod and a mini tripod, besides this micro tripod.  You may also want another tripod for more complex uses or heavier cameras.  Some of the GorillaPod options are described above.  Also consider the popularPedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripod.

I like that the sound control isn't connected to either speaker, it allows them to be place optimally on my PC without the need to reach over to them to change the volume.

$REVIEW.: my cell phone (moto q9c) has 1500 plus songs on it with headphone jack 2.5mm

 my moto q9c has good speakers for a cell phone but not loud enough to hear while in the shower

 also, my previous roommate had a radio in the bathroom and i loved it
 therefore, i decided to buy a radio with aux input for my bathroom/bedroom that i can also take with me to the beach (plays 5 hours on battery that auto charges when plugged into wall)

 1st, i tried the altec lansing iM-237 orbit speaker for ~$25

 the orbit is fairly loud for it's size; however, i was not impressed with how it handled low frequency (bass)


 in my opinion, the orbit should not even attempt low frequency and should instead filter it out
 regardless, i returned it


 next, i tried the altec lansing M402SR moondance for ~$110
 i was very impressed with the sound quality (it did work with my cell phone / moto q9c); however, i thought that it was able to play music using battery and it was not...so i returned it
 another complaint i have about the moondance is that the buttons are not the type that you press on (they are initialized via conductivity) and they responded correctly 50% of the time.lastly, i tried the altec lansing iMT620 for ~$110

 the radio is very clear (no noise) while listening to numerous radio stations


 the buttons are pressable and respond 100% of the time

 the iMT620 plays music very clearly from mp3 player (sansa fuze) and cell phone (moto q9c)in summary, the iMT620 plays music from radio, mp3, ipod, and cell-phone very loud and clear and looks great


 to connect it with my cell phone (2.5mm headphone jack) i had to purchase a ($9 from radio shack) 2.5mm-to-3.5mm adapter cable and i do hear music out of both speakers (some adapters only allow mono)
 i expect the iMT620 to keep my happy for a very long time!  thanks for a great product, altec lansing :)

$review_text.: Let me start by saying, if you like a lot of bass these earbuds are not for you. There is nothing WRONG with the bass, they are just not heavy on bass. If bass is important to you, try theKlipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones. I've owned these for over two years, and they are really great. They are around the same price point as these, but with a much deeper sound. It really is going to depend on your music and sound taste to determine which set will best suite your needs.The buds are very comfortable, and with two of each size, you are sure to find a size that is suitable for your ears and you will always have a backup. You will also receive a cleaning tool, which is pretty standard with headphones in this price point. A nice, although not often used, bonus with this set is the airplane adaptor. Airplane headphones, complimentary or not, are never comfortable. This adaptor allows you to use your own headset while you watch the in-flight movie.My only real annoyance with this set if the fact that you cannot fit the cleaning tool, airplane adaptor and extra ear tips in the carry case. I don't know about your house, but in my house loose accessory tools have a way of losing themselves.

$review_text.: Got this today from amazon and immediately installed it in my 96 toyota camry to replace an aging Alpine 2-din radio receiver unit. Wiring was a breeze using a Scosche TA02B Toyota wire harness(SCOSCHE TA02B Wiring Harness for 1987 and up Toyota) - just connect the wires of both the Scosche harness and the JVC supplied harness according to colors. Also installed a Scosche TA2154B pocket kit (Scosche TA2154B Replacement Pocket Kit for 1978-Up Toyota) bought likewise from amazon to fill the open space below the radio. The radio and replacement pocket fit perfectly in my dash using the stock brackets.The radio unit sounds great and the stereo separation is very good. The HD FM is CD clear and the changeable color display is super cool. It took me some time though to get used to the wheel selector but after a few tries it was fairly easy to operate. No regrets with this purchase. Highly recommended for those wishing to upgrade to a simple single-din HU w/ HD radio,CD/MP3/USB/IpoD,iTunes tagging,Aux input and Front/Subwoofer pre-outs.
$SUMMARY.: !! Great Radio Receiver !!

$REVIEW.: I bought this monitor as an additional display to extend my desktop onto.  It's much brighter and clearer than my previous 22" (1680x1050 res) Gateway (FPD2275W) display.  It's almost unnecessarily clear at 1920x1080 res.  The only thing I'm not a fan of with this display is the glossy finish which seems to collect a lot of dust for some reason.  Other than that, I'm very pleased with the quality and brightness.  I've only had the display for about a week, so maybe it will dull out in the next few years.  But then again, at this price, it's well worth the chance.  In fact, I'm considering buying another just to have matching displays side by side - rather than the unmatching 2 I've paired together.

$review_text.: Like many people I was excited when this new 80-400mm AF-S  design was announced.  With the price tag north of $2600 I decided to rent this lens first.  My first impression was how big this lens is.  It's huge.  The tripod mount is adequate and trust me, you'll need it.  Hand held work will require high shutter speeds along with VR however a monopod or tripod will be needed for best results.I captured a series of field images using a D800 set to ISO 100, f/8 and WB set to daylight.  I mixed it up with both tripod and hand held shots.  This lens has good color and contrast.  The brokah is acceptable but I have to say I was not all that impressed with the IQ.  I see many reviews that rave about the sharpness of this lens and I have no experience with the previous version so  maybe I rented a bad copy.  The sweet spot for sharpness seems to be 300mm and that is where my Nikon 70-300mm f/4 is a little weak but otherwise the 70-300mm f/4 performs as well or better at one-fourth of the cost.I don't mind paying this kind of money for good glass but I was underwhelmed by its performance so Plan B, a Nikon 70-200mm f/4 with either a TC-17e or TC-20e iii is looking like the better option.

When I plug the power in, only one device will work.  It won't run more than two devices.  Now I'm stuck having to purchase another USB 3.0 hub.  I won't buy this one again.

$review_text.: Bought this to use for my custom Hackintosh build and it does not disappoint.  The hardware is excellent quality and overall very good for the money.The best surprise was finding out it has an mSATA connector on board so there is no need for cables running all over the tower.The biggest negative is that the board claims support for the fastest DDR3 RAM but never clocks it fast enough.As I said before, this is a fantastic board for a Hackintosh and even 10.8.3 automatically updated only requiring an update to the audio driver.If you want a full size board for Windows7, 8, or OS X, this is a great board and my only with would be that it had thunder bolt support but, you can't always get what you want on a budget.

$REVIEW.: These batteries are as the originals that shipped with the camera.  Most of the current Panasonic cameras are deisned to only use proprietary batteries.  These have great energy storage & could be a 'make or break' if you deplete your battery and have the need to continue using your camera.  When I think of the time & expense in camera selection and composing a picture & in many instances the $$ getting to the places where I wish to capture an image, this seems like a very small expenditure when considering the whole "picture".

$review_text.: We have two of these cables and they both are working out very well.  I have one to connect my phone and tablets to the HDTV in my bedroom.  Basically, I keep it attached to one of the HDMI ports on my HDTV and the other end over by the bed.  This way I can just plug in my Samsung phone or Archos tablet and throw whatever it is I want to watch up on the &#34;big screen.&#34;  (The Samsung also offer a wireless (wifi) ability to do the same, but not all applications support this feature.  The cable, though, works in almost all cases.)My Son has the second cable and uses it both at home and when out.  He has a Kindle Fire HD and uses the cable to connect the Kindle to both his HDTV and those at the homes of other people.As I said in the title, I'm not sure how much there is to say about cable other than it works fine.  Thus far these cables have been working like a champ since I got mine in 2012 and Able got his in 2014.

$REVIEW.: I have an SB400 Speedlight, which I highly recommend, however it eats AA alkaline batteries.  I haven't found any rechargeables that can really stand up to its hunger for power.  So I have been looking for a "Softbox" solution for the built in flash for those instances when I forget to bring a backup pair of AA's for the SB400.This product is very simple to use.  The bracket fits perfectly into the hotshoe of my D40 and doesn't impede the popup flash.  If does a good job of softening the light to really fuzz out the harsh shadows.  It does limit the range of the flash as any softbox will do.  But for closeups, portraits and indoor shots where your subject isn't too far away it makes a world of difference.  It really helps to bring out the natural tones without washing out your subject.The build quality seems decent for a $6 product.  It doesn't feel like its going to fall apart or snap and it seems to be designed very simliar to other higher priced products.  All in all its a great buy.

$review_text.: We race in the weekends and had a couple of Motorola radio for in car communication, but we were having trouble with interference at the tracks.  A friend recommended these radios and they work great.  We liked them so much that we plan on purchasing additional radios for backup in case of any technical issues (not that we expect any, but better safe than sorry).  The option to use the rechargeable batteries or AA batteries really comes in handy to, just in case you forget to charge them before a big race.  The included headsets were kind of cheap otherwise I would give them a 5 star rating.  So we also bought closed face headsets with push to talk to mount on the steering wheel and we felt like pro drivers it worked so well.  The only minor issue was the volume was a little too low, but I couldn't tell if that was a radio or headset issue.

I tested the card on two laptops and both gave me speed less than 10 MB per second, but the advertisement stated 45 MB per second for read and write speeds

$REVIEW.: I bought this device because I wanted to connect a PC to my home network without having to run wires up the wall and through the ceiling to reach an upstairs bedroom


 I am using this network adapter to tie into a Linksys wireless-B broadband router (my Internet connection comes from an Insight Digital Cable modem)


 Once I got the router and the modem to work with each other, installing and using this network adapter was literally a five minute job
 It works just fine for our purposes
 We mainly use the remote PC to surf the web and play games, and the speed of net surfing on that machine is barely below that of the PC that is hard wired to the router.If all you want to do is typical web-surfing stuff, I highly recommend this item.

$REVIEW.: Installation into an acer quad-core laptop was simple enough.  The tiny phillips screws holding the "door" strip are overly firm and I still haven't gotten them loose to replace the generic plastic face strip with the Acer facing piece (which is a lot different looking and functions as an extension so as to reach the extended drawer.  My main reason for this review is about Blu-Ray drives in general.  Being new to the BD experience, I was real unhappy to find that the security built-into the commercial blu-ray format prevents playback through the HDMI port of a computer.  This means that without illegal hacking of the disc and the hours required to rip such enormous files,  there is no simple way to use a computer as a Blu-Ray player to your widescreen TV.  Also, I tried most of the trial-ware players available to play Blu-Ray on Windows computers.  They all have various limitations.  One or two do not recognize or playback 3D Blu-Ray discs.  It would be helpful to know that at this time, most 3D Blu-Ray is available as Red/Blue or mechanical/optical separation.  We all know that red/blue messes the color of the movie and the 3D TV interlacing views glasses are ridiculously expensive.So, if you're buying any blu-ray drive for your computer, forget about seeing it big or watching that 3D content.  (Some of the blu-ray player programs do display 3D content but had various other malfunctions that made them nearly useless).Great blu-ray drive though.

$review_text.: Looks awesome! I've used Zagg on my other gadgets so I know the drill and I also watched the youtube video. These weren't tough to put on. You just need a little patience. I used a dryer on low while pressing down on the top and sides until they stayed put.The reason for the 4 star is because there's this weird rippling effect happening around the home button. I hoped that it would go away in time but it's still there. Not a big deal since it's in a Snugg case.I installed the Full body on 2 iPads and installing the screen protector on only one of them. I've used Zagg on my iPhone screen and it looked and felt like plastic so I always opted for other screen protectors. I wanted to make sure it wasn't going to give me the same results. To my surprise, it looks so good. Once it dried completely, you can't even tell it's on (except for the weird rippling around the home button). The feel is great too. No change in retina image quality either. Comparing the image quality from one that had the protector vs the one w/out was the same.I seriously wish they'd make a shield for macs so I can remove the Zagg one.

$REVIEW.: This is a very competent sound system. It has a great many features and is very versatile. It is fairly compact and can fit in smaller areas. Is it a high end hi-fidelity system that is suitable for an audiophile&#8217;s taste? No. What do you expect for this price?What is does have is decent power and very good sound able to crank up the volume to uncomfortable levels without distorting. It will easily fill even a large room with sound. It can play many audio sources and has several different sound modes to fit different tastes and music styles.Drawbacks? Disappointingly short lengths of speaker wires. While the left and right speakers can be set adequately apart, the length of wire to the subwoofer is woefully inadequate, you really have to set it almost directly beneath the main module.But barring this problem, you have an affordable, versatile, fairly powerful sound system with overall very good audio quality. I recommend it.

It is much lighter than my older desktop, yet it feels strong and well built


I mention this because some of the newer desktops look and feel flimsy, as if they could be blown over by a feather......not so, with this one


It doesn't get hot and bothered either.It is extremely fast for my needs and I can open many windows without any delay in speed


It is also very quiet, one of the most quiet desktops I've ever owned


It comes pre-installed with lots of goop and all the essentials as well


I just remove the goop and add a few ingredients of my own..


I don't do any *gaming* so I can't vouch for that, but there seems to be more than enough space for my needs.The price is great and the machine is perfect
For everyday personal or business needs, this desktop is your best bet.....
