$REVIEW.: Decided to buy this power supply for it's rating of efficiency and claimed quality of the components used to build it. Absolutely excellent quality all around. It comes in a sweet box and the main power supply unit itself is neatly sandwiched and tucked inside this foam square box that's protecting it from any impacts that could damage the unit while it's in the box. The extra stuff comes inside these nice white fabric bags. This unit being modular was truly a great idea on the maker's part as it makes life much easier not having to have to use all the wires. I only attached 2 of the cable attachments so far for my build and it's very clean in the case without all the other cables just laying around inside the case taking up space or constricting the air flow. I've been able to over clock my new Asus Sabertooth Z77 motherboard with a 3rd gen Core i5 CPU and 32GB of DDR3 RAM up to 4.5GHz so far and haven't had a hiccup, glitch or any weird behavior from the computer at all. This PSU is rock solid performance that's extremely stable for extreme gaming in Crysis 3 and just light browsing the net while listening to music type. Just feels exremely solid all around in my opinion and I love this power supply. Tried a few other ones in the past to save money on such components but finally chose to spend a little more for higher quality craftsmanship which I feel this power supply has delivered without a doubt from the box it came in to the performance it delivers inside the computer case. Everything has been nothing short of high quality about this product and I couldn't be more satisfied with buying this exact model. 100% worth the money if you are willing to put up a few extra bucks for getting a superiorly higher quality built power supply to power your other expensive components for your custom PC build.

$REVIEW.: I loved these headphones for as long as I could use them, and then they broke. And they broke in a *really* stupid way.The headphones, being very small, use an internal battery that is not replaceable. The only way to charge them is to plug them into a USB charger.*Most* devices these days have a smart charge monitor; when the battery is full, it cuts off the charge.Not these Jabras :( I left them plugged into a USB charger for a week or two, and when I went to use them, they were flat dead. Nothing would revive them. Kaput, finished.This is stupid. The addition of a small circuit would have saved them.Why is it that I can't find a BT stereo headset with a life span of even 1 year? Moto S9: broken buttons. Plaintronics Backbeat 903: snapped off a headphone (*very* fragile). Jabra Sport: as above, stupid charge circuit. I love the idea of BT headphones, wish I could find a set that didn't suck.

$review_text.: I received this thing and was surprised at how big it is.  I have a little 12" notebook and this thing is like a full desk on my lap with room for, say, a small pad of paper, or note book, to boot.This is great for those days I want to sit in the arm chair of an internet cafe with my laptop not getting my lap all hot and irradiated (?) so, for that alone I gave it three stars.  It's lightweight, another plus, and slim so I can see this fitting easily into a larger sized laptop case or messenger bag (not the small purse I stuff my little net book into, however)Something I didn't like about this, that is my own fault, I suppose, is that I didn't realize it would require 4 AA batteries.  That's a boat load to be carrying around spares in case it goes south on me mid-session.  I should mention that I have disabled my touch mouse on my net book, because of it's flawed design, I never could not hit the little thing or the click buttons mid word and end up inserting the carrat/cursor some random place in my previously typed sentence and end up with a load of jibberish--that's why I was initially intrigued with this little thing.Still, even if you don't like the pull out touch pad deal (you have to be right handed for this, btw...if you rotate it so the pull out touch pad thing is on the left, the buttons will all be upside down--just thought I'd mention this for my lefty friends) there is still room on this huge, lap-sized landing strip to park your traditional usb plug-in mini-mouse...which is how I ended up using it.And for that, I didn't need batteries.So, really, I could have gotten by with a non-powered, thick yet lightweight drawing board or something of that nature.still, if you really really need that touch screen/mouse capability, this thing might be for you.

$review_text.: This router replaced my old G+ MIMO router from Linksys.  The old one was just having issues freezing up and had to be re-booted at least once a week.  I bought this one on recommendation from a friend, and so far, it has met my every expectation... save one... RANGE!The router out of the box is easy to set up, and activating/deactivating the 5GHz channel is as easy as adding or removing a check-mark.  I left the 5GHz channel running so I could get the benefits at close range, but very few of my devices support 5GHz, so I may change that channel back to 2.5GHz and be done with it.  The good news is that all my laptops, etc. have excellent data speeds now, even at 2.5GHz!My biggest complaint thus-far is range.  My old G+ was in the same location, but I could get good signal nearly anywhere on my property (even the gazebo ~100' away from the house).  Not so much with this router... I'm struggling to get a signal in my driveway which is one wall and 60-ft from the router, and get NOTHING at the gazebo.  Even signal in the farthest bedroom is spotty (40' and two walls).  I've called Linksys about it and they suggested moving the router to a different location, first of all, that is not easily possible, and secondly, the old one worked GREAT in that location... I'll try moving it at a later date, but if it does not make it better, I'll have to ask for a warranty replacement, as I feel something is wrong with this unit.  I'll update this review afterwards.UPDATE:After speaking with Cisco support via phone and chat several times, regarding channel settings, etc., I've played with settings until I've found a channel combination that seems to work much better for my home.  I've disabled the 5GHz (switched it to 2.4GHz), running dual-band 2.4Ghz, and also re-enabled the 5Ghz band in my quest for better range.  I've continued to tweak channels and found two channel combinations that seem to provide better range for my wireless devices.  If you have range issues with this router, switch the channel selection from "Auto", and give each channel and frequency a test to see what works best for your home/business.  It will take a little effort, but if "Auto" is not working for you, this is the best option for finding the best range and speed (reduction of interference).I still like the router, and Cisco/Linksys customer support has been great to work with, but honestly, out of the box, I expected better function and range... and right now, I'm still not getting the range I received from my old WRT110 G+ router.  Yes, the router is a good router (no crashes, lockups, bottlenecks, etc.), speed is better than my old router (wired or wireless), but range is still not in my "happy-zone".  Raised review to 4-stars from three, because of customer support help, and the fact that it does work!

$REVIEW.: I purchased 8 of these to monitor/record my home. My elderly father lives with me and I need to keep an eye on him.  Shipping was fast. Boxes were in perfect shape. These cameras are unnecessarily large. The circuit board is housed in the base that seems like it can be half the size.  The mounts are made from plastic and have to be large to accommodate the large camera. The construction is all plastic. Now to the set up... The power adapters are only 6ft long, so be prepared to run extension cords or buy the extension cables. If you are installing more than one of these, it is best you configure them before installing them. One by one, I connected each to my network via Ethernet and made all the configurations via web console. You will create a user account, name the camera and set up a ton of other stuff like email notifications, brightness etc. You will join them to your wifi via the web console as well.  There are 2 separate firmware updates that need to be done, one for the camera itself, the other for the web console.  The cameras will reboot after each update. When they connect to your network, you have to use this really silly IP Camera utility to see their IP's and MAC address. The tool constantly refreshes and rearranges the list of cameras.  This was frustrating for setting up 8.  There is a way to configure up to 9 cameras at a time, but I saw that later.  You will need to be familiar with your router and setting up port forwarding if you want to see the video over the internet. I also recommend creating DHCP reservations for each camera, that way if the camera is rebooted it will come back online using the same IP. I purchased the Blue Iris software which basically turns your pc into a web server. If you are installing more than one of these I highly recommend the Blue Iris software, since you only need to set up port forwarding once for the software only.  My gripe with these cameras is that they constantly drop signal.  They will drop signal and randomly come back online. I even replaced my wireless router with an ASUS RT-AC66U which was a major upgrade in signals for all my other wifi devices.  I just purchased the 9dbi foscam antennas to replace the current ones, hopefully that works. The other gripe is that the IR is really loud, it makes a loud click when it switches back and forth between normal and IR.  These are one of those products that you just don't know how it will turn out until you actually complete the entire install, and at that point you have invested so much time...

$REVIEW.: Initial setup was nice, particularly compared to D-Link, (the tech decided the D-Link was broken).  But I came home from vacation and its not sending out a signal anymore.  The WAP11 connects to the LAN fine, but none of the laptops are getting any signalfrom it.  Tech support was laughably inept.  Now I've figured out the reset button doesn't actually do anything.  They want me to upgrade firmware a third time.  DSL Reports.com says there's a problem with the latest firmware.  I wish I could buy one of these things and it would just work.

$review_text.: The Seagate FreeAgent external drive is an excellent hard drive. Unfortunately, the USB 2.0 interface is painfully slow for large data transfers. If you need a drive for backup/archival storage, where speed is not relevant, this is a great drive.The Macintosh formatting utility included on this drive was corrupt, but Apple's own Disk Utility had no problem formatting the drive. (The drive comes pre-formatted for Windows, so if you want to use it for Mac storage, you must reformat it before using it.)It is a solid performer and very quiet. The amber LED is a pleasant change from the harsh blue LEDs that other external cases use, of late.One Trillion bytes of storage is what the manufacturers these days call a Terabyte.We old timers, however, consider a Terabyte to be 109951162776 bytes, so the drive really holds 931.3 gig (gibabytes to use the latest geek-speak) of data.If you don't need a speed demon, this drive is an excellent value.The drive comes with a 5-year warranty; another great asset.

$review_text.: Like pretty much everyone looking at this cable, I was hoping to hook up my laptop to my TV
 My computer doesn't have an HDMI output, but it does have an output that I use to connect to a projector at work

 I had THOUGHT that this was a DVI connection, because it looked like the picture, but when the cable arrived it was far too large for the input.After further research, I found out that my computer has a VGA output, not a DVI


 What I needed was aVGA to HDMI Cable, which judging by reviews doesn't work very well anyways as you can't convert an analog signal to digital without an adaptor.So obviously, this cable didn't work and I had to return it

 This isn't the cable's fault, just mine for not being computer savvy enough to know the difference
Looking at reviews, I see that I am not the first one to make this mistake, and I hope this review will help others from doing the same thing.

Easy to manipulate the various settings.Software is easy to use, but I have disabled it from auto-starting in Windows because it is then always running, consuming cpu time (waiting for a camera to attach, and always checking for updates to the software) when, in fact, it *only* needs to be running when you are uploading pictures from the camera - technically, you can upload photos from the camera without the software even installed - but the software makes a nice organizer, editor, and viewer.Wish there was a little more memory on it - 32 meg - we will be getting an SD card to go with it.Highly recommend this camera for a very good starter digital camera.

$review_text.: UPDATE 12/27/2012Unfortunately I had to ding a star on these.  While the sound quality is awesome and the fit works well in the gym, my control talk started flaking out on me after a particuarly hard run on the treadmill.  First the volume up button stopped working.  Then both volume up and down.  Then they would cause my iPod to randomly jump to the next track or fast forward.  I called Monster to get a warranty replacement.  I have to say I was not overly impressed with their customer service.  They won't send out my replacement until they receive the defective pair and evaluate them.  I was supposed to pay for shipping the defective unit too, but they sent me a fed-ex label after complaining about that.  They only had blue in stock to replace them.  I asked about the prevelence of the problem, to which he responded that "there is a new version out".  These are on a closeout sale now, so I think they've redesigned them, hopefully have fixed the problem, and moved on.  I wonder if I will get the next gen of these when my replacement pair fails in 4 months or so?  I can't believe that they claim you can put them in the washer machine yet they can't withstand some sweat in the gym.So no apology from Monster, no quick replacement (2 weeks is what I was told), no assurance it won't happen again.  Can't imagine that attitude will do well for their brand!  I paid a premium price for these, I would have expected premium customer service when things went wrong.  At least Amazon turned around my initial return quickly when my very first pair wouldn't seat right in my left ear because the pivot of the earbud was too stiff.With the new pair, I will be more careful about getting sweat on the control talk piece.------------------------ End of Update ------------------------I'm a music junkie who hasn't been in the gym for ~10 years.  When I recently started a gym routine again, I decided to look into the options for using my iPod nano in the gym.  I didn't want to risk ruining my good Shure earphones with sweat and I wanted better sound quality than from a cheap pair of earbuds.  I found these and was intrigued.  I sweat a LOT and wanted to get earbud style earphones that could withstand the sweat.  Supposedly you can even put these guys in the washer machine!First, the sound quality...WOW!  I was impressed right off the bat with the strong bass without any comprimise in the midrange and highs.  I'm not a basshead, but for the gym, a little extra bass is welcomed!  I get the sound quality of my Grado, Sony, and Shure headphones in a package suitable for the gym.  YES!!Second - fit and design.  It took a little practice to get these in right.  The instructions were helpful - the key is to hold down the flap that secures the 'bud in your ear and insert the 'bud in your ear so you get a good seal.  Once you have a good seal, let go of the flap and it will lock into place.  The sound nozzles pivot within the 'bud body which is a clever little design element that lets them seal and lock in comfortably.  I tried these out in my house for a few hours and found that the flap started to hurt my ears after a couple of hours.  I swapped out the ones that were on in the package (medium) with the ones labeled small and that took care of it.The only hiccup I had was the nozzle in the right 'bud in my first pair was stiff and wouldn't move around freely.  Because of this, it was really hard to insert properly.  Amazon quickly sent me out a replacement pair which are perfectly fine.Third - usability.  They are very comfortable and light.  The flat cable is pretty much tangle free.  The buttons are great for pausing the music and changing tracks.  The isolation is good, but not to the point of feeling completely isolated.  If I pause the music, I can have a conversation with somebody.  This is convenient so I don't have to pop a 'bud out to say "can I rotate in?".  However, when the music is playing, I'm in my own little world of musical bliss.  The cable is just the right length for me to use with the belt clip I use.  If I were using an armband, I'd be concerned about taking up the extra slack, but I imagine you have that issue with any pair of 'phones.  I only wish the switch wasn't as bulky as it is, but you can't have everything.  It's till lightweight and hasn't presented a problem for me.At $99, these are a great deal.  These have made my workout routine much more enjoyable.  I highly recommend these.
$SUMMARY.: No need to compromise sound quality in the gym!

$review_text.: It does what it's supposed to do. I have 2 small complaints: The ball slips a little from time to time. So, as you're scrolling along the cursor will stop or slow down even though you're still moving the ball at the same speed. So far that has not been a major issue though. And secondly, the wire is rather thin. The way it attaches to the trackball itself makes it very easy to put pressure on the internal wiring. Other reviewers have mentioned the trackball glitching out over time. That could very likely be from the thin wiring bending and tensing over time at the internal connection points. To try to keep that from happening with mine, I've simply tied my my cord in a loose knot around the finger hole of the trackball. It takes all the pressure off of the connection point of the wire.

$review_text.: I was excited about this media frame when I purchased it through Amazon. But that excitement turned quickly to disappointment when I switched it on for the first time and found a pinhead size white spot in the center of the display. I don't know how many dead pixels are involved here, but the light shining through is noticeable from several feet away. Had those dead pixels been on the perimeter it wouldn't have been as bad. But appearing almost dead-center makes them all the more distracting.I called Toshiba Support today to complain and the experience was distasteful. I was put on hold for 21 minutes to start. Then, after Chad came on and listened to my complaint I was put on hold for several minutes twice again while he checked with somebody. Finally, Chad came back on to say that dead pixels of the size I described were not covered by the warranty. When I suggested that it was not just the size but the placement and the visibility of the dead pixels Chad simply restated Toshiba's policy to me: small numbers of dead pixels are not covered by the Toshiba waranty. I then asked if there was a local Toshiba rep I could take the frame to for verification that the dead pixels in this case greatly diminished the frame's viewing experience. The answer was 'No!'Now I'm experienced enough with digital displays to know that the occasional dead pixel is simply part of the cost of our new technology. In fact, I have one on the 23" monitor I'm using right now. But a single dead pixel in the margin of my 23" screen is hardly noticeable. On the other hand, a pin-head sized cluster of dead pixels square in the center of a 10" frame - shining white light continuously - is another matter entirely. And any Toshiba exec who saw it would know that this particular frame should have been trash-caned before it ever left the factory.After my conversation with Chad it occurred to me that he had never even asked my name or for the serial number of the frame. Odd. That leaves me to believe that he answered my call knowing in advance that he'd have no need for that information. Get it? Seems obvious to me now that when a complaint comes in on the Frames line the responding rep is predisposed to say 'No!'In fairness, in my brief experience with it, the frame appeared to live up to all the things that had me excited about it in the first place EXCEPT for those dead pixels. So, should you buy one that is picture perfect I'm sure you will enjoy it. Perhaps my problem is the rare exception. Perhaps...

$REVIEW.: Had my Clip Zip for a couple months now
 Love it!  Easy to use

 Follow simple instructions from Scandisk web to load music

 vScreen make playback choosing easy.The included buds are the worst!  Here are some alternatives.Sound Quality:  Sony MDR-AS20J[by a long margin][almost tied]Panasonic Slimz RP-HJE350K, JBuds original, iLuv City Lights EP322[not so good] SkullCandy ink'd S2INCB, Ult Ear 100Loudest[bars on Sansa]:  iLuv [3-], ink'd [3], Sony[3+], Panasonic [4-], JBuds [4], Ultimate Ears 100[4+]Recommendation:  JBud originals, and save $ for Sennheiser 300Bs or Klipsh S4sThe Sonys were the only earbuds that sounded close to a home stereo with headphones!  They are super comfortable


 On the down side, they don't seal out noise and the wires seem fragile and will tangle frequently.Coltrane's saxophone on "Moments Notice" was the hardest to reproduce


 The Sonys were excellent, the iLuvs were decent, the JBuds and Ult Ear 100s sounded poor, the rest were terrible.The Panasonics sound would still rate second, well behind the Sonys with all the music


 The Panasonic wires tangle


 The iLuvs sound was close to the Panasonics and the wires were manageable


 The iLuvs would extend playing time because they need the least volume


 But, the buds are large, seemed to want to fall out, and may not be super comfortable.The JBuds were the least expensive and sounded OK, but the bass is weak


 These are very comfortable buds

 Wires were manageable, but had a straight plug


 The Ultimate ears sound was poor
 The wires were so stiff they would pull the buds out.The Skullcandy ink'd were disappointing

 [EZ, SC fans!]  "Eruption" was electric, better than my home stereo headphones
 They are efficient and reproduce deep bass notes you don't even hear with the others

 But, the saxophone on "Moments Notice" was unnatural and the other tracks sound hollow and distant
 The ink'd were new, they may improve with break in


 Setting the Sansa EQ to HipHop helped the horn, but overall still no match for the Sonys or the Panasonics
 The wires are a little too stiff and the plug is straight.Tested these earbuds by pausing mid-song and changing buds on a Sansa Clip Zip

 Compared, by pairs, to determine the subjective quality of each against the others

 Tracks used:  "Take Five," Dave Brubeck;  "Belong," R.E.M.; "Bring Me To Life," Evanescense; "Atomic Dog," George Clinton; "Wild Thing," Tone-LOC; "Eruption," Van Halen; all ripped from personal CDs with Windows Media Player[320kb/s] and "Moments Notice," John Coltrane from Amazon MP3.

$REVIEW.: I received a Soundfreq Sound Spot speaker to review and these are my independent options.  First off, I love Technology and these speakers are great.  I have used Soundfreaq speakers in the past, and have purchased several wireless speaker from them in the past.  I have always been happy with their products, and am happy with the small, and stylish Sound Spot Speakers as well.  The sound is great!  Crisp, clear, and perfect for just about any style of music.  Between my husband and myself we have listed to heavy metal, hip-hop, rock, and country and everything sounded great.  The bass is fair when you listen to hip hop, it&#8217;s not super loud, but for the size of the speaker I think Soundfreaq perfected the speaker as far as sound.  It&#8217;s easy to connect your phone and enjoy music.  The speaker is light, and the charge lasts a long time.  I cannot tell you how long from start to finish, but my husband listened to the speaker for longer than 4 hours without needing to charge it.Everything is easy to access, the functions work well, and I&#8217;m really happy with it.  I have tried other wireless speaker in the past, and have been disappointed.  I liked this speaker so much I have purchased an additional one as a gift for my mom, and my teen daughter.  Oh, another added perk is that you can charge your cell phone even when the speaker is running on its own battery.  I love that feature, and I&#8217;m sure my teen will put it to use when she receives her speaker.  These really are a nice speaker, and if you&#8217;re looking for a great gift for someone I think they will be happy with the Sound Spot speaker.ProsSound &#8211; It&#8217;s little, but don&#8217;t be fooled.  This speaker can rock.BatteryAppearanceEasy to useLightweight, and easy to move from room to room.Fits nicely anywhereI love the white and wood lookReady to use out of the boxValueConsI honestly cannot think of anything.

Why do manufacturers like HP and Dell ship their machines with such woefully inadequate power supplies? I couldn't have installed ANY kind of power-drawing PCI card with the stock power supply, let alone my middle-of-the-road video card.After some research (locally and online) I opted for this bad boy. It was super easy to install and my new video card is happy. My computer is on 24/7 and for the last 5 months anyway, the power supply has been humming along happily. It's louder than the stock unit, but it's not a bother.I'm very pleased with this purchase. I recommend this power supply to anyone looking for a quality upgrade without spending a fortune.

$review_text.: Other reviews talk in detail about the sound of these headphones so I'll just say that the sound is great. Nice clear highs, good mid-range punch, and deep bass. Unfortunately, that's the only thing I like about these. They are very long, so they stick out of your ears a bit, and because they are back heavy due to the wooden housing they are easily knocked out, yanked, or just slowly fall out of my ears all the time. Yes, I have tried all the different tips they included. The tips are made of some kind of material that makes squeaky noise when it is adjusted and doesn't seat well in my ears so anytime I have to gently push them back in I hear annoyingly squeaky sounds. The volume adjuster / microphone is located just in the right spot that my shirt collar always catches on it when I'm sitting down, and that's another way that they are yanked out of my ears. Finally, people can't seem to hear me well when I'm using these to talk on the phone, and when they can hear me they tell me that I sound strange.All in all, I have not enjoyed these headphones and after trying to like them for a few months I have returned to my cheaper Sennheisers that are more comfortable, lighter, and don't constantly get yanked out of my ears. Honestly I just have not had a good experience at all with these headphones and would not recommend them despite their excellent audio.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the first one of these hoping it would fit a Bescor MP-101 tilt-pan head. It fit perfectly and really improved the usefulness of the tilt-pan head. The RC2 connection is what I use on most of my gear, and being able to quickly add or remove the camera is great.I purchased a second one to repair another Manfrotto ball head. I will need to make an adjustment with a drill press, but otherwise, it will just work nicely - restoring my old ball head to useful.I do a lot of outdoor work, and salt spray is common. This product is mostly aluminum, and it will corrode over time. The one I am replacing is over 10 years old, so the effects have mostly been cosmetic, until recently. And to be fair, I haven't disassembled or lubricated the components, ever.I would definitely recommend this product. It is a part of the Manfrotto RC2 system, and it works great.

$review_text.: I got this for having my first soft ware defined radio.  I use it for FM broadcast band monitoring, 49 MHz walkie talkie monitoring (AM mode and NFM mode), FRS radio, ham radio, and for weather forecasts on 162.55 MHz.  The only thing about this is that the it should of came with a MCX male to Female connector, and a MCX male to BNC adapter.  The software that came with it via download has FM broadcasts in stereo and some RDS decoding.  I am planning on buying a better antenna and maybe a low gain preamp for this.  The remote control that came with it is useless, ended up in the junk drawer until there is a way to use it for some TV app in the future.  This is my first device that take MCX connectors, now I have to start collecting those and you cannot simply find them at a R. Shack.  Sometimes the dongle runs hot, but not so bad and the software needs updating. I will plan on getting another one soon.  I just want to remind you that this device is not compatible with Windows 8.  Only for Windows 7 and earlier.

$review_text.: I bought my Macbook Air MB003LL/A used from ebay. Ive always been a fan of apple, having an iphone and ipad and decided to leave windows behind a try a macbook. Buying a 5 year old laptop can definitely be a gamble. Once i received the laptop i automatically feel in love with the design and extreme lightweight feeling. Once i started using it i can tell a noticeable difference with the speed of this used 5 year old macbook and my 2 year old windows laptop. The macbook is so much faster. I use to think maybe my internet connection was just slow but no, windows was slow. I am completely amazed at the quality. I can see why people pay so much money  for a macbook, it will definitely last longer than any other computer out there. I am happy with my purchase. bye bye windows!!

$REVIEW.: The model I bought (P205-S6297)is no longer available.However, I think all Toshiba Satellite laptops with Windows Vista may run into a similar problem.The built-in webcam stopped working at some point.  I'm not sure when, because I don't use it frequently.  It probably happened after a Windows update.Going back using Windows restore point did not fix it.  When I enable the camera I get an error message to "Please turn on the Camera".  Unfortunately there is no control to do that.  Doing an internet search shows many users get the same error.  The recommended solution is generally to reinstall the driver.  Doing that brings a new error message that Windows cannot install the driver.  So it's catch-22.Toshiba has no support.  They refer all to Microsoft.End result is total loss of use of the web cam.  I have wasted about 10 hours trying to fix this with no success.Otherwise, a nice machine, but I would never buy it again.  This is why Apple is a better integrated solution.

$review_text.: I read of lot of reviews before I bought these and I noticed that people with smaller cars complained about weak bass andpeople with larger vehicles seemed to like them better. I may be wrong but could the door act as a box? Maybe the larger doorslike ones on a Tahoe have more bass? That is how it appears from the reviews. I put mine in my trailblazer and I really love them.They don't have earth shaking bass, But more that I expected from a 6.5&#34; speaker.

$review_text.: This is a wonderful idea, but the keyboard I received had too many problems to keep it, so I have now returned it after only a few days.  The documentation that came with the product was useless, so I went online and found a better user's manual.  That allowed me to use the product.  But of the indicator lights, only two worked: RF Communication Indicator and Charging Indicator.  The Battery Capacity Indicator didn't show anything, but I don't know if the battery was ever low enough to warrant it.  The CAPS Indicator didn't come on when CAPS LOCK was depressed.  The two things that made me send it back were: 1) Range - beyond 6 or 7 feet, it started to get poor reception, and 2) Keyboard - I had to press most keys two or three times in order to get them to work.  It's a great idea, but it just needs to be engineered and produced at a higher quality.

$review_text.: I've been using Norton since about 1988 + have been very happy.  It expired today, and I noticed that Automatic Live Update hadn't happened in 87 days, so I decided not to do the annual renewal on-line. Instead I went to [warehouse club] and bought the 3-user CD (not avail on Amazon at this time). This was to get the latest software, etc. It installed fine, and came up as usual.However, there is a nice feature called Web Protection/Logins that acts as a password repository/autofill. This has worked flawlessly for at least 2 years but the new version has new screens (skins) covering the exact same functions, but now they don't work on about 1/2 of the sites that I visit, while they worked perfectly on the old version this morning. It was so SIMPLE in times past, yet baffling today. I've used this feature extensively.The help site is the product of a Madison Avenue marketing department. Ergo, essentially useless. "Nathan", the human face of a virtual 3rd-grade on-line helper, has no knowledge whatsoever of Web Protection or Logins.  Attempts to chat are sent to forums (which are just FAQs). At this point, I am ready for an Asian non-native speaker on the phone who can tell me to RTFM, but I can't find that option. Oh, wait, yes, phone support. That starts at $39. I guess I will just key in my usercodes and passwords like the good old days.Could someone please respond in the usual ways, via the comments button (thanks):1.  "This is not a key feature of the software, and I should not be complaining". Or,2.  "I never use this feature, but have you tried xxxxxxx? I am sure that would work" Or,3.  "I am a Symantec employee who has tested this software days, nights, and weekends. It works flawlessly, but I cannot contact you to assist you, per company rules"Folks, this really shouldn't be so hard to fix.

$REVIEW.: These plugs have a pretty solid sound and a foolproof design. The contour lets you know that you've got the right plug in the right ear. I've had pairs last for 3+ years of heavy portable use without a single broken cord. They block out some nose but aren't really designed for any serious isolation, which makes them good, safe walking around headphones. They also have the little slider on the split L/R part of the cable. It really helps minimize tangling when brought up to the ear buds when they are being stored. If I could just stop loosing them they'd be even better.

$review_text.: Bottom line: good hardware bundled with one of the lamest vendor-supplied backup utility  programs I've seen (and the bar is set low for this category of software!)So: *after* uninstalling the non-functional backup software from my computer and deleting those files from the otherwise empty hard drive, I tested the hardware. Window 7 recognized it immediately, and using my existing non-Hitachi backup software, it was reading and writing data without problems right away.PROS:-nice sleek appearance.-USB bus powered, so no external power adapter or cord.-small form factor; slightly larger and thicker than a smart phone.-Quiet operation.CONS:-Bundled backup software didn't work, and is equally dedicated to to selling Hitachi cloud storage services as it is to backing up your data.  Excruciating details are addressed separately below.After a short period of ownership, I can't address the long term reliability, but Hitachi drives enjoy a good reputation. This one has a two-year warranty, which is hard to find in these days when the industry standard is one year.Now, about that software, which is flawed enough to cost this drive a star...mostly for the hubris of Hitachi in considering this anything other than a beta release:Hitachi's backup utility ("Hitachi Backup"...the boys in marketing didn't waste much creative juice thinking of this name) was included on this drive. Many external hard drive vendors do the same thing;  I haven't found one worth keeping yet, and Hitachi has not changed my mind with theirs. Even worse than offering limited user options ("Automatic" and "Scheduled"...with the latter being selectable only in 15 minute increments, and no apparent manual/on-demand option) are these other two glaring faults:(1) after setting a backup time under the "Scheduled" option, the user interface backup status indicator switched from "ON" to "OFF"...and would not switch back. And it most certainly did NOT start copying any files when the designated time arrived. This was accompanied by a yellow warning sign indicating that backup was disabled. In the words of Tina Fey on "30 Rock": "what the what?" Apparently the software also has a "restore" function as an adjunct to "backup"...but of course, I couldn't try it without backed up data.-half of the backup user interface is devoted to upselling Hitachi cloud storage services. You get 3GB at no charge by registering; after that, you can buy upgrades at $49/year for 250GB. I didn't register to test this, but hope it works better than the local backup utility. You can register a domain name from many web hosts and get unlimited storage (or nearly so, depending on their terms of service) for about the same price. It's not a competitive price, and I'm not sure it would work given the issues with the software managing a local backup.Do yourself a favor: delete these files from the drive the first time you connect it, and stick with your current back-up method (or use the one bundled with your operating system...or just do a copy/paste when you get paranoid about data loss...any of these approaches will work better than this software).
$SUMMARY.: Buy it for the hardware, NOT for the software...

$review_text.: This is the lightest of the first wave of full Windows 8 Tablets in the 11.6 inch size. We bought it last year here and it outperformed my 600 buck HP Envy X2, which has issues and will not tolerate Windows 8.1 so I keep it on Windows 8.  My wife got this one and the screen is richer, it is much lighter than my Envy X2, and took both the Windows 8.1 update and the update to that, I guess Windows 8.1.1 or Windows 8.1 SP1 fine too! One thing you have to do is go back to the Lenovo drivers site for it in &#34;support&#34; on the Lenovo website and do all the 8.1 driver updates as soon as you update it. You can do all the updates that are newer than  the first wave by date if needed.KIt has no camera other than the webcam, but we do not care. Good value, size, and weight.

$review_text.: After looking over Best Buy's in-store selection of cases, I chose this one -- and I'm still quite happy with the purchase. It looks really sharp over the ipod touch's silver back (the case is slightly transparent), is easy enough to get on and off (when I switch to an armband case for exercise), and seems pretty durable. I think the only downside is that it's just a bit too large to fit inside DLO's armband case --- otherwise, it would be a perfect combo.A friend of mine has her iPhone in a regular hard plastic case, and the thing snapped at the hinges only a week after having it, due to her taking the phone out to put in an armband case. The material for this case is tough enough not to bend all over the place, but pliant enough to get the iPod out easily and quickly if need be.

I use it for a pair of Powerwerks 50 Watt Self-Contained Personal P.A
System that weigh in at less than fifteen pounds each

I typically mount this on aOn Stage SS7745 Adjustable Subwoofer Attachment.My application does not begin to stress this assembly because not only is the total weight half the recommended maximum, but my PA cabs easily fit within the 20" center-to-center distance between the inserts

That is actually a lot of space, so measure your speakers from the center of their pole inserts and if they do not exceed 10" (or 9 to be safe) on each side from the center of the insert they will fit this unit.Construction is an attractive, powder coated steel and heavy-duty


The tightening knob has a sufficiently large diameter to give you leverage to comfortably tighten the friction mount to your pole or stand
This has high quality and a low price - a combination I love.

$review_text.: The "WR-335 Ambient Weather Emergency Solar Hand Crank AM/FM/SW/WB/ALT Weather Alert Radio" is a mouthful -- and for good reason. This product has A LOT of USEFUL functions and features that can be employed not only in an emergency, but in other activities such as long road trips, backpacking, camping, and hiking. Here's a rundown of the functions:(1) AM Radio(2) FM Radio(3) SW Radio (Shortwave Radio)(4) WB Radio (Weatherband Radio)(5) ALT Radio (Weather Alert Radio)(6) Flashlight(7) Handcrank Charger(8) Solar Charger(9) SirenI'll give a detailed description of the functions by first knocking off a couple of functions I consider extraneous. These are (a) the siren and (b) the solar charger.(a) The siren is not very loud. When activated, it sounds EXACTLY like the ring of my house phone (in both the volume and characteristic of the sound). The volume level hardly qualifies it as a "siren." The only use I have for it is tricking someone into thinking the phone is ringing!(b) The solar charger -- I haven't had the chance to properly test this out (when I do, I'll update this review). The manual states that the solar panel is ONLY meant to extend the charge of a pre-charged battery. In other words, it cannot function as the primary mean through which you can recharge the battery. You could try using the solar panel to recharge a dead battery, but given the size of the solar panel, I'd speculate that it takes a VERY long time to bring the battery to a level of charge that might be useful for recharging your devices. The handcrank method of recharging the battery might prove to be more practical.---I've run the radio in the AM, FM, SW, WB modes and they all have very good reception. The radio has a telescopic antenna to improve reception (ah, harkens back to the old days, doesn't it?). But I haven't yet received any emergency alert on the ALT modes to ascertain whether this mode works (when I do receive an emergency alert, I'll update this review).The LED flashlight is very useably bright. It has a very focused beam and a descent light spill that sufficiently illuminates a fairly large area around the periphery of the focused beam.The handcrank charger is wonderful. It will recharge your devices (cell phone, possibly tablet and other devices). The rechargeable battery (WR-335-BATT) in the unit is replaceable!The unit can also be recharged using an AC adapter (included) or a cigarette lighter DC adapter (has to be purchased separately).---This emergency radio/charger is a very practical piece of survival gear outdoors or in an emergency.Every bug-out bag should have one of these! I'll be using this extensively by taking it on my backpacking trips. I'll continue to test this unit like the shelf life of the battery (an important factor!) and the weather alert function -- and this review will be updated over time.

$review_text.: I use the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones for sound comparison because they simply have the best balanced sound that I have heard for under 300 bucks

And they are WAY under.I have had many headphones over the years mainly for use on the commuter train
I can't use the earbud style because they freak me out


I don't like things in my ears

I prefer the over-the-ear style to the on-the-ear style

My past experience with on-the-ear were the Bose QC 2's Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones


They felt like they were crushing my head after a couple hours of listening

What a piece of crap the Bose are! I went through 2 sets of bose, the QC1 and QC2 and the headband broke on both and they cost a mint!-Unacceptable! These Klipsch felt nice and the pressure on my ears was minimal


I could wear them for about 2-3 hours before noticing they were getting uncomfortable

But that's pretty good for most phones


I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD201 and they are by far the most comfortable to wear for extended listening and have an extra long straight cord that does not tangle


Perfect for late night TV viewing
But, not very good at canceling noise


The Klipsh is also a bit lacking in noise canceling but they are not marketed as such and still do a pretty good job

Great for the train but not enough noise canceling for a plane


I have a pair of JVC HANC250  Noise-Cancelling Headphones for that job.I always compare the sound with the actual CD and not an MP3 because there is so much sound that is compromised when compressing
I find that cymbals are quite noticeably destroyed when compressed.The Klipsh have good sound
It is a bit bass heavy but not extreme
These sound as good as the Sennheiser HD201 and the JVC HANC250 but not as good as the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series or the Bose (but the Bose is built like a piece of crap.)The mic works great

It has the same issues with all mics in the outdoors with wind but on the train I am told it comes across clean with minimal background noise

I really like the volume control on the neck
It's a great feature


I also like that these fold flat for storage
They fit in my bag easier.The durability of these is well thought out

The cords are extra protected in all the most wear spots and the headband seems very durable


Only time will tell
The fact that these come with a 2 year replacement warranty is a HUGE bonus!So What are you looking for? What's your most important detail? The sound is acceptable on all of the phones.Great sound on a budget? Get the Sony MDR-V6Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice CoilNoise Canceling?

$review_text.: This is a good magnetic cover for you iPad if you do not plan on needing stout protection for your tablet. The backing plastic fits snugly and the cover protects, but the hinges are flimsy. They are holding up fine on mine, but I can see them wearing out or popping off with a little pressure. The magnetic cover is strong enough and stays shut nicely, but I worry about how long the cover material will hold up. For the price, it's great, but just know what to expect for under $15.

$REVIEW.: PROS: I like the streaming music and slide show capability, but the interface is inelegant and only ONE mode is possible at a time; i.e., you can listen to music, but you can't have it show the time/calendar without having it go out of the music mode. It also requires a LOT of double-clicking.The streaming music is wonderful, since it doesn't require a computer; the slide show is a great feature, too, and both of these justify the price, but although the set-up is easy, the interface is simply not as elegant as an Apple and needlessly frustrating.I use this in my office and set it to play music all day. The sound system is fair-good, but it's not comparable to separate speakers; i.e., my Bose computer speakers are outstanding.The volume level is also lower than what I expected. It needs to be higher to rise above ambient room noise.Bottom line: Good if you don't have a computer that is set up for streaming music, but it'd be better if the interface was improved a la Apple Computer style.
$review_summary.: A very good idea with a klunky interface

$review_text.: This is hands down the BEST PC I ever bought! I had been looking for something powerful and at the time (1 1/2 years ago) went with the MacBook Pro 17" unibody. Nice machine decent performance, but had to run Windows for all my business applications. The 17" is not the best machine to travel so I searched for a "travel machine". Did try the iPad, but it did not do the job. Mostly the job of office applications, mail and calendaring did not work the way you need for business. Not saying the iPad does not have its use, but not what I needed. In addition I quickly realized I need a keyboard and when you finally prop it up, you kind of need a mouse. That is something Apple does not ALLOW you to do based on their license agreement. Even so I jailbroke the iPad, it did not solve the larger problem of having a lightweight machine, with touch; with all the business applications and the entertainment stuff I wanted.My second stop was an ASUS T101MT; the machine did a pretty decent job with everything for travel. Even so it took a lot of work to make the ATOM processors jive well. The touch and handwriting on the machine are great, but if you run a lot of applications sometimes a little sluggish to respond. However, for a little machine with keyboard for $449 on Amazon you cannot really complain. When this was announced at CES 2010, I was in line for one immediately. I was one of the first to pre-order and after waiting for 1 month I actually had my doubts if this will work out as they have release the machine without the very cool docking unit with keyboard they showed at CES 2010. When the machine arrived setup was a brise upgraded to professional and the machine is my main PC since that time. It outperforms my new MBP 17" and is a little slower than my ASUS G53, but that screen, the weight, the functionality AWESOME! The best about the whole package, for you Apple fans who don't like the price, is a MS 6000 Bluetooth keyboard is included, so are a very nice leather case and frankly the design of the pad and size fits landscape exactly in my elbow for comfort. Handwriting is so good with the included stylus that I haven't even trained or transferred my handwriting data from the T101. Already made a trip with it and it is the best of both worlds. Basically you get a cross between a MacBook Air and an iPad. The battery life could be better, but with some configuring I got it to last 4 hours and that is pretty decent. Would I love 10 hours, sure, but at the end of the day you have to consider this. I carry ONE device with ONE power supply that actually has an extra port for USB charging, and these are the nice surprises you get with the machine.Working on it for 2 weeks now and LOVE IT!

$review_text.: The Timbuk2 Gripster Jacket is another in a growing list of Kindle Fire covers, and I decided to give it a try.  However, I was disappointed with the results.  On the positive side, the Gripster fits well without blocking access to the speakers or controls on the Kindle.  The Gripster also works well as a stand thanks to the "grips" on the side.  On the downside, the Gripster feels cheap and mine arrived with a tear in polyurethane on one of the corners on the back.  There is no padding to speak of on the Gripster, and the cardboard on the front and back is very prominent making it feel like a covered shoebox.  For a cover with better materials, padding, and a quality feel; I would recommend something from Targus instead.

$review_text.: I don't exercise as often as I should, but when I do exercise, I hate that awful cable that always hangs down from my ears to my iPod. If it isn't on my chest, banging away, it's on my back, tugging my head back. I've tried tucking it into my shirt, I've tried all kinds of things, ... I know, I know, it's just a cable, but after six or seven miles, it gets on my nerves. I've even tried MP3 sunglasses. (They look awful!)Anyway, now I've finally found a decent set of wireless earphones. These earphones even integrate with iTunes, letting me go forward/back without fumbling with my left arm. My fitness app (Digifit) interfaces with my heart rate monitor (60beat) and iTunes, so these earphones tell me when I'm running too slowly or quickly; also, they let me click back or forward between audio tracks. There's a volume control, too.The battery life is good&#8211; two hours at least &#8211; and there is rarely any of the clicking or popping that one associates with Bluetooth earpieces, even when the heart rate monitor, which is also Bluetooth, is operating.

$REVIEW.: I bought this T.V. to replace an old 20" CRT screen I'd had for the past 6-7 years. I wanted something that could handle HD since I had a PS3 I was hooking up to it. The T.V. itself looks very sleek but does have that black plastic that makes it a dust magnet. The t.v. works great but I did have to tweak the speakers out of the box since it sounded a little "tinny" at first. Overall it's not an issue. It gets 720p and 1080i channels just fine and I think some of my 1080p PS3 games actually come in at 1080p, but I could be wrong. I'm not sure if it's my local cable company, but the channels on this t.v. tend to "rearrange" themselves occasionally so expecting a station or network to be at the same channel number every time doesn't really happen. It occasionally will program back in a channel previously programmed out. That's been my experience with it, anyway. Your mileage may vary. Overall a great t.v. for the price.

It worked perfect

If I could change my rating, I would give them a 5

They have the best Customer Service and monitor their products which a lot of companies do not
If you need any type of cables, I would give them a shot first
Prices are very good compared to what a lot of companies are asking and their cables are well constructed.Originally titled as Cable Does Not Seat Properly-I am very disappointed in this item as I have purchased Media Bridge items in the past and they have been of very good quality
For some reason this item will not seat and stay in my KENWOOD receiver

Any slight movement of the wire and it falls out of the receiver's digital socket

Because it does work, i will only give it a 2.

The problem is, however, that they don't feel, nor do they sound like $200 headphones

The sound isn't bad (especially if you like heavy bass) but that's not enough.I'm a vine reviewer, and hence were given these to evaluate for free, but I wouldn't pay for them

As more and more makers target the mobile high-end headphone market, these aren't competitive enough.

It is not a smart case, which would've been a nice option. It is secured with a magnetic flap that folds back when the case is opened. There is a typing position which may take a little bit of noodling to discover. As with cases of this type, there is no portrait orientation.All in all, smartly designed and smart looking.

I haven't yet extensively shot lower resolutions but in general as others will vouch for, using a point and shoot at anything over 12mp and you're just pushing your luck anyway.  My quick impression on the few I did shoot at lower resolutions, the pics were stellar and closer to the hx9v, but not it's equal.  a minor issue but I liked the build of the body on the hx9v better as well.That said, everything else about the camera was superior, the general operation was quicker, shots were quicker, video recording was quicker.  the sony menu system needs work but just in general, the experience has been that of an upgrade I am happy I made.  I am in the minority here but I found the wifi option a very nice addition.  The complaints about having to switch your ipad to the camera's wifi network were pointless to me.  When you look at it, there just isn't a way around that issue, this is exactly how the eyefi cards work as well, it's probably an available api issue.  Sony in my eyes has made the experience as painless as it possibly can.  Would it be more advantageous not to have to switch wifi networks?  obviously yes but givent hat's not feasible, it works great.  I found it ridiculously convenient to be able to send a few shots to the ipad or iphone when on the go to quickly post to facebook, texting or something like that.  I also without any problems, loved the feature to wifi send and offload images to my home desktop when at home.  I could have just been lucky or maybe I am network savy enuf, but for me, everything worked as advertised on the wifi front.  a 20$ premium for the wifi has been a no brainer upgrade for me.  I get home and just in a few menu options, send all the pics from the card to my pc to where I can do what I want to do with it.  usb charging is great as well.  the gps is also much better.end of the day, with adjustments, the pic quality gap can be narrowed quite a bit to the hx9v which by most accounts, was the industry standard for the best of the best point and shoots available. the gap that is most definitely there in pic quality for me was blown away by the other upgraded features to the point that I do feel this is a great upgrade.
$review_summary.: softer then the HX9v but faster and wifi works great

$REVIEW.: Usually I write long, profusely technical reviews.This is short (busy today).I love the whole DM1Z series and was one of the first adopters a year ago, got a new model a week ago - DM1Z-4200 Customized.Here you see a ship-ready (preconfigured model) but its basis is same as for my customized DM1Z (I selected E2-1800 processor instead of stock 1200).Immediatelly I removed Harddrive & replaced with Crucial SSD, sold HDD (note: HDD is 5400 rpm speed, unlike my HP Elitebook's whose HDD is 7200rpm also coupled with SSD except it's Intel-branded).I paid $30 more for a custom config.People who waste money on MacbookAir need a life - that product is so much about appearance & hype than function, likewise iPhone fad is a fad - Motorola Atrix and Samsung galaxy beat iPhone into the dust.But I am a dry technical professional so I don't represent teenagers, kids of housewives who think anything made by Apple is "good".This HP is a dirt-cheap superNetbook or subNotebook whcihever term is preferred."super" is because it is NOT based on Intel-Atom, but is based on much better (for Netbooks only) E2-1800 processor which offers discrete-class Videocard, this little tiny supernetbook has video capability of a full blown midrange laptop.While I do serious work on HP Elitebook - that machine costs like a used car ($2K), requires ACpower (it eats battery in 4 or some hours due to crazy hi-end video), it has nVidia, weighs and sizes like a mobile workstation.  That's fine.  BUT for travel and fun computing on the go - I got this DM1Z.Sometimes I feel weird because some days even prefer using this DM1Z instead of a powerful Elitebook which sits at home.DM1Z will run for 8-11 hours depending on how good you are with power management settings & wireless & video use, which far better than MacbookAir which is using Intel core i3/i5 processors - more suitable for fullsized laptop than ultraportable laptop or netbook which is what MacboorAir or HP DM1Z are.  Macbook air will die in 5-7 hours, and IF YOU NEED Intel core i3/i5 processing power - I just had a thought, why not get a normal laptop then?  Netbook is supposed to be optimized for portability, weight, batterylife and connectivity; in this case DM1Z is also optimized for imporessive Video card rivaling many normal-sized laptops.  I run even Adobe Photooshop, YouTube, etc and all this multitasking is tolerable, not same experience as on HP EliteBook but still UNEXPECTEDLY good for a $400 netbook!E.g. I set brightness to minimum.Also I applied antiglare film to mimick HP Elitebook & other PROFESSIONAL displays which are always Antiglare, unlike consumer cheap type which is glossy to attract fools.Not having an option for antiglare screen is my only complaint but really - film costs $10-15 (HiDef version) and no big deal, besides many people aren't using it for business like myself and actually prefer glossy/glare screen.P.S. Changing TN LCD to IPS type LCD would increase laptop price by $50 or so, and as a side note to HP's management:I WOULD PAY FOR IT if it were availableIPS is a must for professional graphics work (e.g. CAD, photography).

$review_text.: So I wanted a fan cooler so that I could play games on my laptop without my computer shutting down

 icore 7 really heats up to 95C!I decided I needed "does the job" fan which would not make my wallet feel..sad?Everything in the reviews stated it was a weak item..that it seems to want to break if moved around


 ITS TRUE

 Just follow the reviews and dont move it around, also keep it in a flat surface because the fans are not protected..they get caught by cloth or what ever is bellow the area of placement.I decided to get this instead of the Cool Master X2 because of the price and the need.It cooled my laptop from 92C down to 85-80C and sometimes 75C
It just takes about an hour before the results were positive=]It may not seem like alot, but it makes a diffidence..now my computer doesn't shut off AND while playing games it doesn't lag because my icore doesn't slow down.I recommend this for someone who needs a quick fix to "computer shutting down" which I had.It has 3 fans..they arnt the strongest

 Wish it could blow more air..but it does the job.Anyways it was a GOOOD BUY..just hope it lasts long! I will put update when and how it breaks


*cross fingers* not any time soon i hope!Update: This is not something you put on your lap, ALSO I dont think it will fit a 17" laptop BUT you can place it on top and move the laptop to align it where the fans should give air to the laptop
(which is what i did with my 15" laptop

$review_text.: Had to replace our 50" rear projection Toshiba which cost us about $1500 with this 50" wide screen plasma. Years ago plasma was out of sight expensive. Now this 720p HD wide screen cost us just over half of the original big screen tv. I hooked up an hd over the air antenna and the picture is fantastic. I won't pay for the extra for hd digital from Directv but the standard digital picture is, while not up the standards of hd, still very good. Better than the Toshiba I replaced and good enough for most stuff. The Toshiba was an HD tv, at 1080i and this 720p is better, which you'd expect. At about 10 feet away the picture is very, very good. The set with an upgrade dvd has a wonderful picture. I'm not sure why you'd pay more for a tv. Maybe you're a videophile. Maybe so. For my money, this set by Panasonic is a great value with a no compromise picture. It is true that the set's sound needs to be supplemented if you want great sound with your movies. I recommended Panasonic and this 720p 50" hd tv.

$review_text.: I have never owned an Ipod so I can't compare this player to one, but I can't imagine an Ipod being much better.  This is my second MP3 player, the first being a cheap $20 Sandisk player, and I absolutely love the Sansa e280.  I have put almost 1,000 songs on the thing and it sorts by album title, artist, song title and so on.  For the price, you seem to get a lot of features and great functionality.  It is also very durable.  My wife wanted to help mow the lawn recently and she wanted to listen to music like I normally do so I let her use the Sansa and it fell out of her pocket and she ran over it with the riding lawn mower!  After searching for a while, I found it buried in the ground with tire tracks across the back of it.  Fearing the worst, I dug it out and it was still playing and didn't have a crack or anything on it.  It was just a little dirty, but I haven't had any problems out of it even after that abuse!Pros:- Low Price- Ability to hold thousands of songs, as well as, videos and pictures- Very intuitive to load songs using Windows Media Player.  I'm sure you can use other programs, but Media Player works great for me.- Screen is large, bright and colorful.Cons:- There is no power indicator so if you hit the power button by accident, like when it's in your pocket, you have no way of knowing that it is on.  I've done this a couple of times and only knew it was on because I hit the volume button causing the screen to "wake up".- The volume control is kind of flimsy feeling and is very sensitive.  I've been listening with the player in my pocket and when I pull it out of my pocket, I almost always cause the volume to go up or down.  This can cause quite a shock to your ears when you turn the volume up full blast without meaning to.- You can't delete pictures and video from the player.  You have to connect it to your computer and go into the file menu on the computer to delete them.  You can delete songs from the player though.- The earphones that come with the player are really too short to be useful for me.  If I tried to carry the player in my pocket the earphones would pull out of my ears so I bought another pair fairly quickly.So, for me, the pros outweigh the few cons that this player has.  I would easily recommend this player for anyone looking for a great MP3 player at a great price.

$REVIEW.: I was using a PAC RP5 unit for my 2011 Silverado.  Even after updating to the latest firmware, the dang thing's built-in steering wheel controls would just not work.  I decided to spend even more money on ridiculous interface adapters and tray this.  Holy cow what a difference!  I was about to ditch my head unit but this saved its guts.  My steering wheel controls work almost perfectly and the unit sensed my vehicle and head unit without issue.  The firmware I received was already the latest.Finally someone makes an interface that actually works.  Now here's to hoping it doesn't burn up on me... just my luck.

$review_text.: I originally purchased this as an FD to EF/S adapter for using my FD lenses with my first DSLR Canon T3
Obviously there will be no autofocus on your FD lenses because, well, neither the FD lenses nor this adapter have any electronic connectors.Eventually, I learned that you can use FD lenses with an adapter for a cheap macro photography setup


The tutorials I've found on this showed me that you are able to remove the lenses just by popping them out, which isn't the case for this adapter
Instead, this adapter allows you to screw out the lens all together (I used pliers and a soft cloth...)

JUST BE CAREFUL TO NOT SCRATCH THE GLASS


The entire lens inside this adapter is just one piece and is screwed in by threads

Once you have this out of the way, just pop on your 100mm FD lens and you'll have a nice little cheap macro setup.You lose a little bit of picture quality - but you have to remember, you're using an adapter for lenses not made for DSLR cameras

Otherwise, it does what it is supposed to do.4/5

$review_text.: This cable is VERY well made, and seems extremely sturdy.One thing to note is that this cable is very thick.  This is a plus for me, as it indicates larger gauge wire and good shielding, but it does make it less flexible.  For normal routing, this won't be a problem, but you aren't going to bend the cable 90 degrees in 2" like a cheaper one could.I don't have the equipment to test the 3D support, etc, but it works great for normal 1080p video and 5.1 DolbyDigital audio.  For the price, this is the best I have seen.

$review_text.: I was hesitant to try these decals, but I have to say that they are wonderful. Before applying, thoroughly clean your workspace (a glass tabletop works great), because the underside of the decal will attract any tiny speck of dust or pet hair (and you will NOT be able to remove it) and it will be visible under the decal. Follow the instructions and the decals are actually very easy to apply. Some people claim to have been able to remove them and store them in the original packaging. I had no such luck. One tore on an upper, inner corner, and another stretched out of shape. I would not consider these reusable.

Guess what..


Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support


Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver


From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit.This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time


I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers.You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead

You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit).

The best part is that it offers fiber-optic output for audio.. so for the first time I am getting true 5.1 surround instead of the onkyo make believe kind. The remote is a run of the mill sony device that hasnt been updated in about a decade. I dont use it (get a harmony, they are AWESOME)!Why not 5 stars? its a bit on the slow side and the automatic resume function is not as easy to use as you might think.

$REVIEW.: This board for me has been typical for Asus quality, rock solid
 I have had no major issues with the motherboard
I'm running a Core i5 3570k at 4.7 Ghz with 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance 1600 ram

 This board comes with several great features I really enjoy

 The easy BIOS update is great, update from windows with Asus update or from a USB flash drive
 The UEFI Bios makes tweaking a breeze

 This board boots very quickly, sometimes I don't have enough time to hit the delete button

 The integrated WiFi works flawlessly
 Basically, this board has every feature I could possibly need, which is why I didn't opt for a more expensive model

 The Asus utility suite has some pros and cons

The auto tuning feature worked well for me, but further teaking from the app didn't go so well
 Here's my major gripe, the tuning app set my vcore to 1.5v without my input

 OC profiles wouldn't save so evey time I reboot the PC I'd have to reapply my settings

 I ended up doing my overclocking directly from the BIOS and I've had no problems since
 My other gripe is in the windows app you can set your vcore with a slider bar, in the bios you can either go full manual or offset mode


 I don't find trying to manipulate the vcore offset to be as user friendly as sliding a bar to your desired max vcore

 Also, I haven't been able to get consistent results out of the offset settings


I'm running +.080 to get my desired 1.28 vcore which seems to be counter intuitive to everything I've read (vcore - desired vcore = negative offset)

As of this date I'm running the most recent BIOS, maybe in the future the vcore adjustment could be a little easier.Putting my little issues aside, I would buy this motherboard again and I will continue to buy Asus in the future.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Vizio SV420XVT to replace my not-so-old Vizio VX42L, a TV that I had nothing but problems with.  My first VX had severe backlight bleeding, and the replacement unit developed audio dropouts, so I decided that perhaps I should abandon that model altogether and upgrade to Vizio's 120Hz model.Straight out the box, this TV makes a powerful impression.  Its settings are nearly dead-on, but there are of course tweaks to be made.  I am still undecided in my opinion of the Smooth Motion feature; it is far too unstable to use for movies, but decent enough for sports games.  It essentially creates an extra 4 frames for every 1 frame of input, increasing framerates from 24 frames/sec to 120 frames/sec.  During movies, this can lead to herky jerky movements in fast moving scenes, while at the same time create smooth as butter motion in slower scenes.  The effect is very similar to watching a soap opera, and I definitely prefer watching my movies at 24 frames/sec.There are many extra features built into the TV, but I find that the picture looks best and performs most reliably with them turned off, with the exception of Adaptive Luma.  Even without these features enabled, the picture is jaw-droppingly good.  Blacks are much more solid than earlier models, color accuracy is greater, and contrast is surprisingly good.The addition of an optical digital audio output is a very nice feature to have on a "value minded" TV as well.  This complements the gaming performance of this set nicely.  Both PC and current generation consoles look amazing on this TV, and you will not be disappointed if gaming is your main reason for purchasing.QAM tuning seems to be hit-or-miss, depending on your cabling.  The tuner had some issues pulling in channels when the coax run was longer than 25 feet, but that is the weakest feature I have found so far in the entire unit.The remote is a step backwards from the older units, in my opinion.  Far too flimsy and lightweight, it offers many choices for functions like PIP, but has no PC/RGB input button as the older remotes did.  That means switching to the PC input requires navigating a scrolling menu, something that is just downright ridiculous in this day and age of HTPCs.  Kind of a moot point, however, since most people have a nice universal remote anyways.In short, I think this TV is a great deal for the money.  You have to remember that this is Vizio's first foray into the world of 120Hz LCD sets, and they are nipping at the heels of Samsung and Sony, who are already on their second generations.Below I have provided the settings I have found to be the best for all around quality:Picture MenuPicture mode: MovieBacklight: 33Brightness: 49Contrast: 50Color: 40Tint: 0Sharpness: 4Advanced Video MenuNoise Reduction: OffColor Enhancement: OffAdvanced Adaptive Luma: OnEnhanced Contrast Ratio: OffColor Temperature: Normal- Red: 127- Green: 129- Blue: 128Smooth Motion: OffReal Cinema Mode: Off

$REVIEW.: I ordered this prior to ordering a 4' optical cable of the same brand

The two cables came about a day or two apart
I installed the 4' cable and gave this cable to my daughter, where she could use a six footer
It works great on her sound bar.

$REVIEW.: Like many other reviewers, I've gone through a lot of headphones over a lot of years.  I still have a nice set of noise canceling wired headphones that can't be beat for pure sound reproduction, but I hate having to plug in at night.  Since I watch TV's and game in my great room, I've got about 18 feet or so between me and the headphone jack on my speaker system.  I've got a 25 foot extension cord for the headphones, but it gets really annoying to always be unrolling it to use and rolling it up to put away.  I've gone through just about every brand of wireless headphones but never found anything that worked well.  Either the sound was poor, the cups were uncomfortable, or it just broke up way too much (remember the old IR ones that, when you moved your head the wrong way, the signal was chopped totally?)So when the time came again for some hunting, I found this unit, and the reviews really seemed to give it a lot of credibility.  So I purchased it from Logitech since I had a coupon from another logitech product's registration they sent me.  Got it for a good price.I was wary of the "sidetone" thing people talked about, but since I'll be using this for watching TV and playing games solo about 99% of the time (don't do much online gaming, just randomly here and there), and since the mic was muted when put up (or by the button press) I wasn't too worried about it.They arrived, and I plugged them into my macbook pro for a while before trying them, letting them charge up.Installation was very easy for me since everything already was wired up, I didn't have to worry about individual things plugging into it for my warmup tests, just the little 1/8" jack from the headphone outlet on the Logitech speakers to the base unit of these headphones.  I wanted to take them for a spin just watching TV and playing games solo at first, and deal with the chatting later.With just the single input, I didn't have to play at all with the input selection, when there's only one item plugged in, that's what it automatically goes to.  Had no sound, and realized that the roller volume on the headset isn't just a normal rheostat with a definitive start and stop, it rolls and rolls, and the limit is electronic, not physical.  So I cranked them, got my TV to the normal viewing volume I'd have it at otherwise, and adjusted the headphones accordingly.And was blown away.  Great sound, more bass response than I thought even with the good words other wrote about it.  Nice separation of sound, good middles and highs.  Only downside was that I found myself still moving around a phantom cord.  I'd tilt my head when I turned to help keep it from getting caught on my shoulder.Fired up the PS3, played a game.  Outstanding.  Xbox, same.Put a movie on, walked around the house, and loved the range I get.  I got to the very opposite corner of my house (TV is in the extreme south east corner, bedroom is in the extreme northwest).  I could get all the way to that corner before I started getting a drop, and then only when I bent down.So on to Xbox live with a friend - and it worked just great.And found that the sidetone feature may be useful for me after all just while watching TV.  I usually keep one cup only partway on one ear so I can hear if my son yells for me after he's been put to bed, nightmare, whatever.  So the sidetone feature may actually work to my advantage.The base unit is small and unobtrusive enough that it's not an eyesore, and the LEDs in front are dim enough to not be a distraction even in a darkened room.Glad I took the plunge, was worth every penny.

$REVIEW.: I've used a number of small radios since giving up my table top shortwave listening.  The G6 is a very good digital readout radio.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to use it without reading the supplied manual.  I find the radio to be very sensitive on AM, FM and SW.  SW and AM are my main interests.  The tuning dial on the front of the radio allows me to move from channel to channel, and the direct keypad entry (key in the frequency then press AM) is like the Sony SW radios.  Another thing I like is the sound of the radio: you can select a narrow band for voice or a music setting that gives much better fidelity.  The radio's case has a rubberized coating which is really nice.  Also, that the G6 only needs two AA batteries is a plus---I don't like the cost of buying batteries, so to have this kind of performance with two AA batteries is a plus in my opinion.This is not a 'toy' radio.  It is sensitive, operates on AM, FM, SW and SSB and is very well built.  It does not feel cheap, nor does it look cheap.  The AM BCB performance is great and so is the SW performance.  FM seems good/excellent.I've always believed that if the SONY 7600GR had a tuning dial that it would have just totally wiped out the competition.  The G6 comes very close and if it had synch detection, it would be a 120 percent winner.I suggest this radio as a very competent design, excellent RF performance, and a user interface that is excellent as well.

$REVIEW.: I use these speakers in a small office to listen to news and classical music. The most impressive thing about them is their overall balance and clarity. Male voices are clear and completely free of upper-bass boominess. Classical music is accurately reproduced. As I type this, I am listening to Schubert's Trout Quintet. The double bass is clearly audible without distortion or undue emphasis in the upper range. The piano and strings come through naturally with low distortion. Other classical music also sounds great. Even harpsichord music is cleanly reproduced, with sparkling high frequency overtones. I listened to many other speakers, some costing several times more before deciding on these. All of the others were annoying in one way or another: many had exaggerated bass and some had piercing highs. These Klipsch would be a good bargain, even at a much higher price, if you're looking for clean, natural sound.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased a Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC memory card as a backup to my Sandisk Class 10 SDHC memory card. I know Sandisk makes great memory cards but I was still curious to see how the Transcend's write time compared to the write time of different class Sandisk memory cards. While the Transcend SDHC memory card is designated Class 10 it came nowhere close to the real world write speed of a Sandisk SDHC Class 10 memory card. Testing the time it takes from when the picture is taken on my Panasonic G5 until the camera is done writing a RAW/JPEG combo (21.3MB in size) the Transcend performed closer to what I'd expect a Sandisk Class 4 memory card to write. The Sandisk Class 10 (45MB/S) memory card was almost twice as fast.I compared the write time of a Sandisk Class 10 (45MB/S), Sandisk Class 6 (20MB/S), Sandisk Class 2, and Transcend Class 10. Taking multiple images with each card and averaging the write time gave the following results:Sandisk Class 10: 3.3 secondsSandisk Class 6: 4.2 secondsTranscend Class 10: 6.2 secondsSandisk Class 2: 7.9 secondsWhile the Sandisk Class 10 is a few dollars more than the Transcend Class 10, the money is very well spent knowing you are getting twice the performance.

This wire was a great choice, it is a good gauge, yet still flexible enough to work with easily.

$review_text.: Dropped this into my 2011 MBP 15" which I use for development. Interestingly, I already had a 500MB 7200 RPM drive in there, so this is a 'real' test of the flash caching hardware. Honestly, those that saw a boost going from a 5400 RPM drive would have seen that regardless of the hybrid factor, just because this is a 7200 RPM.For loading the apps I run all the time, including the OS and my favorite IDEs and editors, it's noticeably faster. It isn't 'instant on' like some pure SSD setups approach, but it definitely loads faster than a regular 7200 RPM. This did take a while to start seeing, probably due to the algorithm that decides what gets cached. I've also run a custom Win 7 setup with Intel Smart Response- a pretty similar technology though that one works on the motherboard level vs. the drive here. The relative jump in performance is a bit smaller with the Momentus XT, but then again it was a lot cheaper too.That is the big selling point of this technology- it's way way cheaper than buying a big SSD and just running off that. The performance isn't up to the same level, especially if you run programs or access data that you haven't run regularly. But it's still a notch higher than a standard hard drive when it comes to things you use frequently (which is what most of us do in daily work). Also, if the flash fails for whatever reason the drive still works, and these plain old rotating platter hard disks are proven to be reliable.Been a few months now, and it's still running fine. The drive itself is very quiet and actually runs cooler than my previous one- another plus. I haven't noticed any decrease in battery life with this drive.Pros:Good performance boostInexpensive compared to full SSDsProven tech for longevityQuiet, runs coolCons:Doesn't help much for data/programs you don't use regularly

$review_text.: I've been using my Livescribe pen for just over a week now. I love it, and am not sure how I ever worked without it.In the past, after I taped an interview I would be transcribing it for hours -- even though I knew most of the interview would be background. Usually only a few precise quotes are used. But it was always impossible to find those exact quotes w/o going through the entire tape. Sigh.This past week, I've taken notes as usual (the paper is totally cool) and marked where the best quotes were so that I'd see them once I connected the pen to my desktop or laptop. I'd go directly to that spot and then I transcribe those quotes exactly. I can just flesh out the rest of the notes for background.I also like how I can put the software on multiple computers, and the pen's rendering of the pages are great.The downside I've seen to date is that I can't hook this up to a phone to use it for a phone interview. I'd need to use speaker phone so the pen could "hear," and I hate using a speaker phone for an interview. For those, I have to record the old-fashioned way -- hooking up my digital recorder to the phone. Oh, well. Hopefully the company will solve that problem some day.If you are a reporter, you want this pen. Really.

I don't know about the sound experience being better or worse yet, though I do see how there seems to be a tad bit of a bass punch due to the fact that the headphones are a smidge closer to your ears with these pads.  It certainly should be an improvement material-wise since the fake leather kind tend to crack over time (which is why I needed new pads).  They are also more comfortable than the originals.

Even in low-light settings it does OK, but is a little grainy.  For its size and quality, there are few other options that could do as well for the price.  It has a very nice wide angle, so it can capture almost anything that would be within your view.

$REVIEW.: I ordered two of these, they arrived yesterday and went back to Amazon today-- purchased two HP keys instead.  These are attractive, but beyond that the workmanship is poor, one of the two keys took so much jiggling and pushing to get into my USB port that I was afraid it would cause damage to my PC.  It's simply not worth it.  The 'small' size is too small for the materials used and in my opinion you're just asking for trouble using these on a daily basis.Like many others mentioned, upon request Amazon gave me a refund and I ordered a different item from them instead.  Amazon stands behind the product they sell like no other merchant-- that's why I have spent many thousands of dollars with them over the last seven years and am a very loyal shopper.  A few bad buys now and then by the purchasing department are bound to happen.  Nobody, even Amazon is bulletproof-- but they stand behind it all.

$review_text.: This is my third Rainbow Imaging K-mount to m4/3 adapter. All three have fit and performed well. This model appears to be the earlier version with the paddle type release versus the joystick of the other models. And each has had a different type of Knurling on the mount. Fit and finish is fine, especially at the sale price of @$13.All three focus "beyond" infinity by roughly the same amount with my 28 and 50mm primes. It would be nice if they were closer to infinity at the dead stop, but I can't complain for the price and convenience.It's become so comfortable using the adapted SMC-M primes on the G1, that I forget that I lose the IS. These really expand the use of these toys.

$review_text.: First, let me start by saying that I have really low standards when it comes to a laptop mouse

I honestly go through about two or three a year
I always buy cheap mice but this is by far the cheapest

Item arrived less than two days after order which was great
This is obviously a very cheap mouse and people really shouldn't have high expectations

Don't get me wrong, it works and suits my needs
That being said there are some pros and cons to this.Pros:- Item was very cheap and probably wouldn't mind buying another in 6 months or so.- It has an on/off switch, which my last one did not have.- Very lightweight, and has a blue laser on the bottom which ie easier on the eyes than red.- Comes in just about any color you can imagine.-It's VERY CHEAP!!!!!!Cons:-Had a very hard time opening up compartment where batteries are installed, which in turn chipped the cover, had to tape cover back on.-It is cheap in price, and feels very cheap in your hands, like cheap chinese plastic.-It will not operate properly on my desk surface, when many others have worked.-I will have to buy a mousepad to use this on my desk, for now using a magazine.So,overall this is a good buy if you want a cheap mouse that WILL work

I reccomend this to anyone unless you don't want a mousepad
That being said I may be looking for a replacement in the near future, but really isn't the product's fault, just a personal preference.So if you read this review, please remark as to whether it was helpful or not, and feel free to ask questions or comment.

Be warned however, this is an APS-C size format and therefore not recommended for the Canon EF full frame models such as EOS-6D, EOS-7D, and Mark III. For the price, under $500, I really can't complain about the lens. Accuracy down to the pixel level seems strong. I do recommend a polarizer in strong sun.It also seems Amazon has a tendency to recommend hood purchases when they are already included. This lens has a hood.

$REVIEW.: There's been a plethora of reviews already, addressing specs and then comparing attributes, but I thought I've give a little perspective to those who shoot similar to me.On paper, let's be honest, the 5Dmk3 doesn't seem all that more impressive than theCanon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), and then compared to theNikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)- it looks like a perfect storm against the 5Dmk3.I typically used a pair of Canon 7D's (and sometimes a Canon XHA1 as an additional back-up against corrupt files on the 7D bodies before the 1.2.5 firmware update) to shoot video. Fine video, with a crop sensor (helped in recording speeches or wedding nuptials from the back of church, etc), didn't downconvert HDMI out to monitor to 480p like the 5Dmk2 when you pressed record. Of course there were the typical Canon SLR problems, the moire - aliasing, and the approximate 12-minute recording time limit. And of course, a 7D is only decent in low light.I recently needed to purchase some additional bodies, or camcorders, which would have:-longer record time than 12 minutes-be much better about moire - aliasing-be tapeless (I know, shame on me for being so late in making sure that even my backup is tapeless)-be better than decent in lowlight-beneficial if it could use EF lenses-would be nice if they could take good pictures (this last one was strictly because I take business pictures as a filler for cash from time to time and fill in as a second photo shooter in weddings when I'm not taking video)I used a 5Dmk2 on shoots from time to time, but had not owned one. I thought about going thePanasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black)along with a 5Dmk2, since it seemed the differences between the mk2 and mk3 were not so great, but there was enough of a price difference to make me wonder what the big deal was.But I was also really impressed with Black Magic Design's Cinema Camera from this year's NAB show, which could be purchased with an EF mount. However, it wouldn't be released until the end of July, and I needed to purchase before June.I settled on the 5Dmk3 over the 5Dmk2+Panasonic GH2 option and the Nikon d800 option.And I'm very glad that I did.Pros:+30 minute record time (well, 29:29 - for tariff purposes, if you don't already know why the strange record limit)+Fixed moire - aliasing issue (Well, made it much better. It can still show up in certain angles with certain patterns, but I see it maybe once a wedding shoot)+clean ISO up to 3200, very usable at 6400, okay at ranges higher than that+Full-frame is just so nice, compared to crop, micro 4/3, or Black Magic Design's almost micro 4/3 chip+Much better pictures than the 7D+Headphone jack for monitoring+CF and SD/SDHC card use+Didn't have to sell my EF glass and re-invest in Nikon glass to go with a d800 or additional issues using EF lenses on the GH2 bodyCons:-Not as sharp as a d800, but usable, clean sharpness can be added in post, and far more superior in lowlight than the d800. (I recommend a d800 if you are always in a studio setting, but if you do more event or run-and-gun style shooting, the ISO range is a must)-Dynamic range doesn't seem to be as good as d800, but once again, shoot with a neutral profile, or Technicolor Cinestyle profile, and fix in post-Initial price-30 minute record time (I put it in the cons as well because some events may need continuous shooting of 30 minutes or more)-On board sound recording (I put this here because it's still not phenomenal. It's decent. And that works fine sometimes. But not all the time. Same with any SLR body, though.)To be honest, the 5Dmk3 fixes so many headaches that I was having using the 7D as my main video choice, headaches that would not have been resolved with just the 5Dmk2. The d800, which takes beautiful pictures, is a fantastic camera except in one very crucial area, lowlight. Even though it starts out with a brighter image at its low ISO levels than the 5Dmk3, the noise is atrocious as you increase ISO, even with noise-reduction software. A beautiful love affair can be had with the d800, I will say definitely say. And to all the GH2 fanboys, there are so many good things about the GH2, but it really felt like a trade-off compared to the 7D. It's like those bodies, the 7D and GH2, complimented each other greatly in that where one was weak, the other fixed, but in turn was weak where the other was strong. (If that makes sense.)I purely wanted to upgrade to fix issues. The 5Dmk3 has proven to not be deficient to where I would need the 7D, or another camera body, to fill some gap.I've had zero buyer's remorse from this purchase. And I can't say that about many purchases.Rating: 4.5 StarsPrice knocks it down to 4 StarsBut because I love using it, 5 Stars - I know, all crushes are 5 stars when they first start out... so it's really a 4 - 4.5 Star product

$REVIEW.: It was a challenge to get set up with ATT/Bellsouth.  I'm not sure why, but I had to re-enter my username (email address) and network password (call to get it, it's not your email password) several times before it finally just started working.  The status screen said everything was good.  But internet wasn't working.I've come back and knocked off stars because of the bad implementation of port forwarding.  When on the main "local" screen, sometimes all connected devices show and sometimes not.  There's no rhyme or reason to it, wireless or wired doesn't seem to matter.  To set up port forwarding, the router has to recognize what devices are connected.  There's no option, as on other routers, to just tell it an IP address.  It requires that it "see" the device.  And since this is buggy, it's not possible to set up port forwarding to some devices.  When going to the Security tab with port forwarding or the My Network tab, there is no way to forward a port that is on the network, fully working, but that the router isn't seeing for whatever reason.I've found reference to this same problem from others on Google.

$review_text.: My wife and I own two Casio Exilim cameras that use the NP-20 battery.  Within a month, the first battery was bad.  Attempting to charge it results in a flashing red light, which is an error condition indicating the battery will not charge.  A few weeks later, the second battery was dead too.  Casio did send us two replacements for free, and acknowledged having trouble with these particular batteries.  After 6 months, one of the replacements died.  Another call to Casio, and thankfully they provided another replacement.So we've had 5 of these batteries, and 3 were defective.  We don't use the cameras often.  We checked all the batteries using both of our charging docks, and confirmed in each case that yes, the battery was the problem and not the charger.Casio has treated us well and acknowledged the problem, though.  My recommendation is to call for replacements on they day you buy a camera that uses this battery -- you're going to need them.
$SUMMARY.: Horrible, defective batteries.

CD player works well. Wish there was another auxiliary input on the rear. Can't comment on USB input, haven't used it yet. Bottom line: It's a $75 radio & as such works well enough for this half-deaf old man.

$review_text.: I have this card and a few of the Extreme version and an Extreme Pro version.  These cards are a good value and I have used them in a handful of DSLRs and P&S cameras without issue except the 5D Mark III.  When the 5D Mark III is set to 1080p at 30fps and Low Compression (intra frame, ALL-I) AND my aperture is f/4.0 or higher I hit the buffer limit very quickly and the recording stops.  So in short the card cannot keep up with the write speed of the large files.  I cannot recreate this problem in any other camera then again I don't own anything else that records at that high a quality and low compression.  I have this card and lots more compared on my website - the number of shots in JPEG and RAW that you can get in a 10 second burst is almost as high as the Extremes in the T4i.

$review_text.: The plug is so tight (or perhaps it's the friction of the plastic used in lieu of metal) it's VERY hard to stick it into a USB port and pull it back out, which has me worried that I might break the inside plug of the port sooner or later.

I will therefore use it in rare situations only (I needed it to make an SD card temporarily bootable which is only supported via USB).

$review_text.: Pros:1. No delays or lags of any kind2. Doesn't require a separate antenna or cable card to stream live TV. It uses the feed from the main unit (Tivo Roamio in my case) so you  won't need to rent an additional cable card or run an antenna to a second TV set.Cons:1.Doesn't support Wi-Fi. I had to run a 70 feet CAT 6 cable to connect this unit and it's annoying. If I can stream Amazon or Netflix in HD quality through my Wi-Fi network I'm sure it would work with Tivo's too. By today's standards it's hard to justify Tivo's decision to exclude the wireless option.2. The quality of the picture is degraded compared to a feed directly from antenna

$REVIEW.: This Edifier USA e25 Luna Eclipse speaker set is a quality sound device that is useful for smaller rooms with a television, and certainly a good product to use, via bluetooth, with tablets and smartphones.In terms of size and design, I really have no complaint. They do have a weight they does seem beyond their size, and I assume the magnets are quite large in this pair. There isn't much sound distortion. The bass is not especially deep, and there isn't much of any 'tinny' sound that comes from them. For your average sized living room, these are certainly fine enough.So I think these speakers accomplish what they were designed for, in an attractive package, and they receive my recommendation.

 The range is advertised as 30 feet; however, I experienced a range of about 20 feet indoors when there are no obstructions

 At about 20 feet, the signal starts to miss.You can listen to music and take a phone call easily with the push of a button.Overall, I recommend this as a speaker to listen to music and a handsfree speaker phone.

I will confess that I have never been impressed with any keyboard thta Apple makes, However, Targus does seem to have a keyboard that responds in a way that a PC person like me can appreciate.  But the downside is that the keyboard is very small and it seems a little bit too flimsy in the middle. I type fast and furious and I do not like feeling so "cramped" when I work.Things I would rather have had with this keyboard and I have with every other device keboard I own are:*10 key numeric keys off to the right for putting in figures - a definite must when doing financials and spreadsheets.*lighted keys.* A carrying case. - When one travels, having a case for device accessories is a must.

$review_text.: We have a dozen or so cameras (all exterior) located around the house and property, but due to how the front porch and door is recessed, it would have been nearly impossible to mount a dome or bullet camera to cover the front entrance without it sticking out like a sore thumb. I decided to mount an indoor camera to cover the front door and I installed this camera approximately 2 months ago. I wanted to try a concealed/covert style to avoid mounting an obvious dome or bullet, but must admit I fully expected the quality to be crappy because of the low price. I was wrong. This little camera not only blends in perfectly on the ceiling, the resolution is indistinguishable from 750 tvl cameras mounted outside. This camera does require more light to operate than our outdoor domes and bullets (when they are in color mode), but I don't need it to, nor would I really expect it to. I am extremely impressed with the quality of this camera and am amazed at the price. I strongly recommend this camera to anyone who needs an interior day only camera, but doesn't want to install an obvious camera. I should probably point out that I did not hook up the microphone, since I only needed the camera. Therefore I can't comment on how the audio works, but have no reason to think it wouldn't impress me just as the video has.Amended review on 9-2-2012:I have just installed a second one of these cameras in the office and experienced the same results. Once again, I'm very pleased. This is a very nice camera at a remarkable price.

$REVIEW.: Tried two of these for my Canon Powershot SD800 IS Digital Elph and neither would power the camera. Camera works fine on its battery BUT these devices evidently do not work with the camera. Replacing the battery with the ACK-DC30 left the camera dark. Checking the output showed an AC voltage of about 50v AC as the output NOT a DC voltage. Two devices same result. Maybe a bad Chinese import?

$review_text.: We live in a split level house and have a problem getting decent wireless signal throughout the house, so I picked up one of these extenders. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised at: how easy it was to set up (even though my router doesn't support WPS); how portable it is once set up; and how well it works.After I set up the extender (I set it up wirelessly by connecting to the extender and going through a web interface), I moved it around several times to see where I got the best performance. Overall it took me about 30 minutes to finish up (that includes moving the device to different outlets and going around the house testing the signal strength.

I got them from 3rd party site: ANCO and I got to give them a shout out because they responded promptly to emails and gave me a refund even though I was a few days outside of the 14 day return policy


I will try another pair after my credit card cools down from the holidays
I will say that I noticed on the treadmill TV plug in at the gym after I started to sweat I'd get shocks from the earbuds to the point that I went back to my iPhone earbuds when on the treadmill


I've had other headphones do this, but never my iPhone buds&#8230;don't know why


 Also, I wish you could double tap the center control to skip to the next song when listening to music

I can assure you that it has saved me on many occasions, (including Laser)


you have to learn it's habits and also set it up properly


So when my wife needed a new detector for her car (old bel 20 years old died) I bought this type for her


i noticed some people saying it doesn't work for them, i can only say that once you understand how a radar detector works and set your unit up (mine came shipped with laser set to off even though the manual said the default was on) i think it does the job very well and is very reliable.

$REVIEW.: I bought this hard drive to replace my old Maxtor 40 gb, which nowadays is hardly enough for storing my tons of photographs. And I wanted to keep the old 40 gb as an auxiliary storage device. I had a lot of doubts about my ability to do this type of upgrade, so I read the reviews, and asked some questions. I must thank the endlessly patient and kind Mr. R. A. Edington "Amazonaholic" for all the help he's given me.The most difficult part was trying to remember how I last cracked open'd my old pc, which was 3 or 4 years ago, to install a second RAM, DVD burner and USB2 ports. To make more room, I chose to remove my 3.5" floppy drive. Yes, I still had that in! Haha.What I did first was install this new 300 gb hard drive as the "slave" and the old one as the boot drive. I then turned on the pc, and installed Maxtor's own software cd. After installing the Maxtor software, I chose the option of copying (cloning) everything from my old hard drive into the new 300 gb Maxtor. After that was finished, the instructions tell you to shut down, and exchange (switch) the connectors & change pin configurations in the back of both hard drives.I turned the computer back on, and everything worked just fine. No data or programs were lost or changed. The last step was erasing (formatting) the old hard drive to ready it for new data. I could not believe how easy it was to upgrade to this larger-capacity hard drive. In addition to wrestling with how to open up my computer to get to the vacant port, reading the literature, downloading the software, cloning, powering down & up twice; it took me 2 hours and 10 minutes.It's much quieter than my old hard drive, and faster. And like the other reviewers, this is one that I could recommend.

$review_text.: I just bought the new MacBook Pro and wanted to protect it against dirt, fingerprints, spills and any other mishaps that may occur


So, I ordered this keyboard cover.I have mixed feelings about this cover


Here is the good and bad.The Good:Very thin and light weight.It is also see-through as not to interfere with the back-light.Affords some protection, but not as much as I would like.The Bad:There is no adhesive, the cover just sits on top of the keys


Therefore, the only protection is from dust and fingerprints.Again, due to the loose fit, liquid can easily get underneath the cover.You must apply more pressure on the keys when typing.This product is better than nothing, but does have It's drawbacks.

$REVIEW.: Right out of the box this thing is big. Hanging on the wall it looks like it is at home. We love it. The sound from the speakers for everyday viewing I find is more than adequate. I have had no issues with glare or reflections (looking at some of the other reviews this may be because of the mounting location.).  I have it hooked to a over the air antenna. The HD stations are more than impressive... they are AWESOME.... The other stations pictures are very nice as well. I also have it connected via 50ft. HDMI cable to remote computer for streaming video. Again.... AWESOME....For the price I found this Flat-Screen to be a bargain. If you are in the market for an affordable big screen. I would definitely put this one on the short list.

$review_text.: Reviewing the Eye-Fi is not a straightforward proposition.  Your opinion will vary depending on your needs and expectations.  If we look at it purely from a technological achievement, the Eye-Fi gets 5 Stars.  It's amazing that an SD card no bigger than any standard SD card can communicate with a network using Wifi and instantly upload pictures onto your Computer or other networks (such as Smugmug, Flikr, Facebook, etc.)  There is definitely a WOW factor when you take a picture and it appears on your computer screen about 20 seconds later while connected to your Eye-Fi internet account.Eye-Fi Explorer comes with lots of snazzy features like geo-tagging (shows where your picture was taken through wifi triangulation) and hotspot access (discussed below)Here are the issues I found in using the Eye-Fi.1.  Since Eye-Fi uses your digital camera battery as its power source, it does drain your battery faster than if you use standard SD.  I don't have a good sense of how much power it uses.  But if you're traveling on vacation and try stretching your battery to a full day of use, the extra drain on your camera's battery may limit your shots in the latter part of the day.  So if you use Eye-Fi, definitely carry an extra battery with you.2. You can't directly change Eye-Fi settings with your camera.  You have to plug it in the USB port of your computer (using the supplied SD reader).  So if you need to change the settings to change the network (a likely scenario if you're on the road) or  password (also likely), you'll need a computer to change the settings.  For me this is the part that makes it less useful than what I had hoped.  If I need a computer to change the settings, I might as well bring the computer and load standard SD cards onto the computer (and wi-fi it from the computer to Home or Smugmug).Eye-Fi anticipates this issue and provides a solution that may be very workable for many or most people.  The Eye-Fi comes with hotspot access through Waypoint.  So you can upload transparently when at McDonalds or other Waypoint hot spots.  It can also use "open" wi-fi hotspots.  But nowadays most router setups require passwords to get on.  So it would be nice to be able to type in a password or select a wifi access point.  Perhaps in the near future cameras will include built in interface with Eye-fi that will allow the user to change settings directly from the camera...that's the obvious next step.  Although I have no inside information on this, my bet is that the Eye-Fi designers are probably working on this solution as we speak.Installation was easy enough, although my computer had to go searching for the driver of the included card reader.  It worked easily enough, but some people I know would get tripped up over something like that.  Once the software is set up, it is easy enough and straight forward enough for most people.I give it 4 stars because there is some room for improvement...which I suspect will happen in the near future when digital cameras and eye-fi are fully integrated to allow changing settings directly from your camera.For pro photographers, there are easy workarounds for the issues I mention above...extra batteries, entering the right wifi settings (password).  But for the more casual traveler, you might find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, or don't have the means to easily change the password settings on the card...or perhaps you didn't buy the extra battery because you didn't think you'd need it.

$review_text.: I purchased these a few weeks ago and used them almost daily since.  Over the past holiday weekend, they were worn on a cross continental airplane trip and otherwise, daily during a one-hour one-way vanpool commute as a passenger.  I also own a pair of Bose QC2 headphones.During the trans-continental trip, the headphones were hooked up to a portable laptop computer while I watched downloaded YouTube videos.  (My laptop has a 5-hour battery life, so I watched videos the whole trip.)  On my daily vanpool commutes, I attach them to either an iPod or an iTouch, primarily listening to language training rips (at 128 kps encoding).1. The noise canceling of the MDR-NC40 is not as good as on the Bose, as a qualitative side-by-side comparison.  That is to be expected, considering the respective costs between the two units.2. After about four hours on the plane, the MDR-NC40 headphones started giving me a pressure 'headache'.  They are not expandable to the point that they were comfortable wearing for that much of an extended time.  (I'm fairly large, 6'3" tall, weighing right at 200 lbs. and wear a fairly large hat size, 7 1/2, I think.)  For 'normal' sized people, this may not be an issue.3. Don't care much for the battery arrangement on the MDR-NC40.  It is somewhere in the middle of the single cord and contains the on/off slide switch as well as a momentary cancel button.  What's that for anyway?  You can hear people talking anyway.  The battery box does have a clip that allows easy attachment to a shirt, so the weight of it does not pull down on your head.4. I like how they fold up and store in a smaller pouch than the Bose.  +1 for the Sony on that account.5. Be wary, however, that the two-pin airplane adapter is easy to lose.  Not much holding it into it dedicate pouch inside the storage case.  Mine fell out tonight on the vanpool ride home, but luckily, I noticed that it was missing and found it on the floor of the van after everybody else had left.I gave it four stars for the price/performance, but had to detract one for being too tight on my head and causing discomfort.  I'll keep them for the wife to use and I'll use the QC2 headphones.

$review_text.: Purchased these in-ear headphones for easy and critical listening.I've bought many headphones as an audio engineer and these sound great out of the box!Pros: Great sounding headphones. It will give you the sound that you get from a closed-ear headphone without much (if any) bleed to the environment. At a moderate level, no one outside can hear what you're listening to. Represents the mids and highs very clearly and accurately in a pleasing manner. Even music that you find sibilant, these will tame them in a very pleasing sounding manner. Comes with no-tangle wire and storage pouch. Very solid feeling, feels like you won't be able to break them if you're a bit rough with them.Cons: Alot of low-end bass. Some people would find this feature a positive but being an audio engineer, I tend to prefer a neutral frequency response. I'd recommend burning these headphones in at least 40 hours before using them, this WILL tame the bass and make these headphones sound amazing. I'd recommend playing a variety of music through them at a moderate volume overnight or when you are not using your music player for 40-50 hours, this will drastically improve how they sound!

$review_text.: I ordered this kit for my Nikon D7100 SLR. The filters are great and I was able to screw the polarizing filter on to my camera and use it right away. I found the large carry case footprint to come in the way of travelling without bulky camera bags. A small hard case which takes all three filters with a foam insert would have been fine.The pen was a little hard to figure out. I would up opening the back cap and spilling the cleaning fluid overy my desk. Once you figure out how the cleaner, brush and pen style fluid dispenser works, its smooth sailing. The lens cap retainer came in handy but the lanyard was a little short for the giant 72mm cap. Sometimes, the dangling cap came into my field of view.The flare hood is still a mystery and I am using the flare hood that came with my Nikkor 18-200 mm zoom lens. The spare lens cap is handy when you lose the OEM cap and it even looks like the Nikon lens cap!All in all, I am not complaining about the value. Just for the three filters alone, I was happy to pay the price. Amazon service, as always was superb and I got the materials in time for my trip.

 It is great for a camera with lense attached and 2 extra lenses (or 1 lens and 1 flash).The pack is a bit small if you are used to a real backpack and if you are larger (I am 6' and weight 190), the pack feels small on your back.I actually ended up getting the one larger which felt more comfortable and let me hold all my gear.You "DO" have to get used to how to use it - as it is awkward in the beginning.

$REVIEW.: I needed the ability to plug multiple kitchen electrics into an outlet that was hard to reach.  This solves that problem and more.  I just couldn't be plugging and unplugging each thing as I needed it to an outlet back in a corner and behind things. I'd need longer arms at the very least.  Being able to use the food processor, the stick blender, the spice grinder, the blender or the food saver when needed without a major effort to plug the thing in each time matters a lot to me and that deep corner on the counter is where they all live.  The one outlet with two plugs just didn't cut it, nor was there room for a standard corded strip to plug things in.  This thing is great because I could remove the switch plate and plug it into the outlet and screw it tight.  The wall mount keeps things as tidy as possible and allows me to keep 5 things plugged in all the time with an extra slot for the occasionally used item.  I'm only using one gadget at a time so I'm not overloading the circuit, just making things easier on myself.The surge protection is an added benefit because my food processor and blender are not things I'd want to replace if a power surge damaged them.  I've used this receptacle for multiple years and have never had any electric sustain damage.  In fact I liked it so well, I added two more where I needed to plug in more things that the standard two up outlet would allow.

$REVIEW.: This product overall is OK for only 40 bucks,but there are a few cons however. Sometimes when I select a song that I want to listen to, it freezes,makes a loud annoying sound, and then restarts itself. Also some times when the back light would go out and I touched the screen, instead of showing me the screen I was on, the screen was completely grey and I couldn't do anything to the player but give it a hard shut down. The video quality is great, but it has a hard time synchronizing the audio to the video. The recorder,however, is AMAZING! The equalizer is amazing as well. So overall I would say that for a music player its fantastic, for a video player, however, its just OK. They do give you a wall charger and a one month warranty. You need to buy your own headphones though, because those are terrible. The ones they gave me were SUPER cheap and one of the chords was short, and the other long.The headphone jack broke and now I have to hold on to every time I want to listen to a song, and sometimes the screen will have lines going through it and mess up very badly at the bottom. If you take good care of it and put a longer warranty on it you should be fine, but you would really have to act like its your prize possession and don't overuse it. I've dropped it on hard concrete several times and it still works, so its durable, but it will malfunction on its own, so be careful with it and you should be fine. looking at all of the other reviews on this product, everyone had a different con than the next person, too many flaws on this player if you ask me. I've had it for over a year now, and it's still  having the same problems, so...

$REVIEW.: This is a great, ergonomic design and I love this mouse. Nice to have a full-size after having V220 for a few years. Everyone keeps talking about how great it is to be able to plug and play. Yes that is true but the Logitech SetPoint software is one of the best features of this mouse. Can make a left click on the scroll wheel open the application switcher and a right click open the start menu. Like that. Forward and back on the side of course is great to have. Great quality mouse, pay more and you're getting ripped off gamer or not.

$review_text.: This Supersonic SC-55 Digital Converter Box was easy to setup and quite small
Once plugged in and connected to the monitor for my computer, an older Samsung Sync-Master710MP, it allowed a set up program to run and it located the channels available


That was it

 Easy

The Antenna is a RCA ANT145oBM Multi Directional Digital Flat Amplified model and it draws in channels from 35 miles east and 65 miles west of my Location
The signals are clear and if the TV itself were more HD they would surely be better

If I try it with a HD, I will up date my review

 For now I will say I am happy with the ease of operation and the product functionality


 It works for my needs as it is used
 The price was right so, I recommend this little converter box.

$REVIEW.: I use this on a 37 inch Aquos (Sharp)


It weighs 37 lbs
 The item pictured is not what you will get

The one you will get has 2 screws, 2.5 inch


You need to pre-drill the correct pilot hole on center...and you MUST use a level

 Make it very snug and that is all

 If it it not vertically level you will always need to re-adjust the horizontal angle when you swing it from left to right (on the axis closest to the TV..there are three joints ...like your arm..shoulder, elbow , wrist) as it will not be on an even plane
Keep this in mind when installing and take your time and make it very level

You should use a good screw gun/drill and do NOT over torque
You can go to peerless website and plug in your model to see if this will work


I called Peerless and the women I spoke with was very knowledgeable

You can call them what you have and ask it this is a good match for your TV.

$review_text.: I bought this item because of its advertised 500 Mbps speeds


 I needed to be able to stream HD video from my NAS upstairs to my living room downstairs and didn't want to run network cable.After getting it setup, I could only get about 24 Mbps throughput out of these and my house is only 2700 sq ft


 That's not even 5% of the ADVERTISED SPEED!  A complete joke

 I couldn't get a single HD video stream to go over these.Needless to say, I returned this joke of a toy and decided to convert my telephone lines into gigabit LAN since my house phone lines where wired with CAT5e and I don't have telephone service
 Even though I am only using a 100 Mbps switch, I can still handle 2 full HD 1080p video streams on just 100 Mbps

 This further illustrates the point that this junk hardware cannot even live up to a 16 year old network technology rated at 1/5 of it's own advertised speed.

$review_text.: Used this for an iPod Touch 4th Generation.PROS- Fairly solid construction- Like that it's all self-contained, no extra cables or anything else needed- Seems to have pretty decent volume- Good bracket system feels solid, easy to use, and holds the iPod really wellCONS- May NOT charge your iPod Touch 4th Generation; it keeps popping up a message that my device isn't supported for charging- 3 out of 5 for reliable signal/sound quality; I've had better- Flex system a good idea, but they don't seem to have done much practical testing; from a front mounted lighter socket in my '04 Subaru there isn't really a very handy position for it. It's not completely unmanageable, but any position is a bit awkwardOVERALLI've tried three different car kits for my iPod. The other two had better signal/reception quality, but their construction gave out within a matter of weeks or months. I'd like to have something that makes access and control much easier. The awkward of this one definitely is a safety issue since it requires too much attention to engage with it to do anything. All the cons considered, though, I've been more satisfied with this one than any of the other products I tried.

$review_text.: Incredibly useful little devices. I keep on adding one of these to pretty much every Amazon order -- I'm always finding something that "needs" surge protection, and at this low price, it's pretty much a no-brainer. The Surgecube was a little bigger than I expected it to be, but it is by no means bulky. The green lights, however, seem to be brighter than necessary to indicate that the device is functioning properly. It might be annoying out in the open in your bedroom, for example.The Amazon description says the Surgecube protect up to 885 Joules and 45,000 maximum spike amperage. The product packaging, however, indicates 1080 Joules and 72,000 amps... which I guess is some order of magnitude better? (Hey, I'm not an electrician.) That's also twice as many Joules than the similarTripp Lite SPIKECUBE. I guess you might not *need* this much protection, but if you're going to go, you might as well go big, right?The Surgecube is, unsurprisingly, made in China.

$review_text.: Like everyone in these reviews, the Leaf is phenomenal

 Some specifics (what I found generally lacking in these otherwise great reviews)
 I live in a 9th floor apt in Falls Church, VA

 I have a Vizio M470SL (47 inch flat screen)

 I read here that for the Leaf to work my TV had to be &#34;digital ready.&#34;  I went to every online source I could find - but couldn't find that phrase anywhere
 (Lots of refs to HDMI on the Vizio, but none to &#34;digital ready.&#34;)  The Leaf arrived, I pulled it from its packaging, amazed by its wafer thin size
 I screwed the coax adapter into the back of my flat screen, hung the Leaf next to the window to my balcony, eventually found autoscan on my Vizio TV, hit the button and watched the TV find about 52 stations


 Amazing

 Not all of them are crystal clear, but about a dozen are HD, over the air
 Incredible

 So clear that I can see where talk-show guests are wearing too much make-up


 Hope the above is helpful.

$review_text.: It's very aesthetically-appealing; the Red/Grey colors are very attractive. The mouse is well designed and fits my hand nicely.I miss the scroll-ring on this trackball, although I will now be using both, this Trackman, and my Kensington Orbit with Scroll Ring (I returned Expert Mouse it was a piece of crap). But the awesome "Cruise Up" and "Cruise Down" features almost make up for it. It will take some getting used to however.The scroller is too far from the hand, since I use my index finger to maneuver the trackball. I made the two buttons above the left click to be cruise up/down as opposed to using the scroller. The scroller would be a lot better if it were smooth with ball-bearings. I like to "flick" the scroller to slide far up or down the page. Can't do that with this trackball.The trackball is a little heavier than Kensington's [Orbit with Scroll Ring] ball, since it is bigger. But the excellently-designed software makes up for this, as you can very finely tune how fast and far it moves.One of the best features of the software (the SetPoint software, downloadable from their website), is the Orientation control. When I first used this trackball, I noticed that moving around was crooked (like instead of moving vertically, moving at a slight angle). But the software is remarkably designed, allowing you to configure the exact angle you're holding the mouse so that when you move the cursor around it's not moving at a crooked angle. That is a real bonus for this mouse. The software developer really hit the mark developing the software.Another great software feature, is you can set the buttons to do absolutely anything you want, even press a key, open an application, or pop up the start menu. They even have lots of default options that are rather neat, and useful, such as copy, paste, and Document Flip, which I might not use but that's pretty nifty! The highly customizable button configuration ability is a real plus for this trackball.The resolution of this trackball is rather low, however. I would like at least double the resolution for what I paid. It's lower than most $20 travel mice you can get at the store. Not good for a $100 mouse. I find myself undershooting or overshooting even after finely tuning the mouse speed, and this is solely due to very low resolution movements (it's not wireless lag, as the receiver is inches away from the trackball).I believe this trackball was intended to be maneuvered with the middle finger, which would place your ring finger on the right-click and your index finger within closer reaching distance to the scroller. Unfortunately I have already developed very fine motor movements with my index finger - something that has taken years to gain such skill. Thus I have to use my index finger and this makes the buttons on top not placed very well.For gaming, though so very infrequently that I play games, I will be using the Kensington trackball over this Trackman. There are two reasons for this -1) The Trackman is rather low resolution, and2) Being wireless there will be micro-second lag which is bad for gaming and FPS. (However for regular use there is absolutely no mouse lag whatsoever and I'm not sure there really would be any lag during gaming since I have not tried it.)Really the Kensington Orbit With Scroll Ring would be perfect, if it had more than two buttons. There are benefits and detriments of both - The Kensington Orbit has the Scroll Ring which is great, and high resolution movement, but only two buttons; and scrolling is the detriment of the Optical Trackman as well as being lower resolution, but it has lots of highly-configurable buttons. Personally I will probably go back and forth between the two and keep them both since they both have their advantages. Plus wireless is a bit of an advantage in some scenarios (although wireless is useless for mobility like for a laptop, due to the large corded receiver).Overall it's a great device, the only real downsides are the large corded receiver and lack of scrolling convenience. That's why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.UPDATE: I just discovered the Switch Application feature! Wow this is so awesome! This is a Must-Have and I'm going to quickly get used to it! Normally I switch windows using Alt+Tab, which works great but sometimes I have so many windows open it can get confusing, because I have to always keep the last open app in my head so I know which app I'm switching to. However this gives a mac-like multiple windows display that is part of the software, and it's really awesome. Only downside is I want to make the lock button switch applications, but I have to settle for the down button below the scroller. Which is fine but I wanted to make that button Page Down. Well I just made the lock button be page down instead (Page Down is important because the scrolling is not very convenient, can't fling it down).Also the Keystroke assignment allows multiple button clicks (like you could do Ctrl+Alt+S, not that you would do that combination but you could). Which is also awesome. Now I wish this had like 10 extra buttons I could configure ;)
$SUMMARY.: Good trackball, almost as good as Kensington Orbit With Scrollring. This is the second-best out there.

$REVIEW.: I got it for $59.99 + tax

Came with Android 2.2, front facing camera, No hdmi, etc
I was able to root it & install the old android market.I played Angry Birds, Tetris, Jewels, Flight Control, and Yu-Gi-Oh! on the GBA emulator fine

Kindle app works pretty good, a small lag turning pages


Youtube works


Netflix lags (way too slow)

Screen quality 4/10 (plastic, not glass)
Camera quality 2/10

You have to press hard with your fingers (i use my fingernail or a fine-tip stylus which works better) for the touchscreen to work (sometimes the screen responsiveness lags, other than that when it decides to work its faster than you would think)


Also the G-Sensor accelerometer is very sensative (you can turn it off and manually change the orientation).Mine seems to sometimes shut off after like 15 minutes of use, if it wasn't for the tablet doing this most of the time I would consider keeping it
Of course its not going to be as good as the Kindle Fire or the Nook which each cost over $100


It only has 256mb RAM


But for $59.99 + tax is not super duper bad, I just wish it would stay on and not shut off randomly (most of the time the only way to power it back on its to reconnect it to the charger and let it sit for a few seconds, then turn it on)

I don't know if its just this one or all Sylvania tablets.Its sorta like having a MetroPCS phone


Lol.

While it is mainly meant for voice recording, it works fine for recording music (though no stereo support exists).It is able to act as a pass-through by puttting it in record/pause mode while the record source is set to "audio in". Very handy for checking levels, making sure it's actually going to record the correct sound source, etc. (This is only useful if you plan on bypassing the builtin mic.)All in alal a very handy device, and welll worth the purchase price.

$REVIEW.: I wrote a review of the D80 after I had used it a fair amount.  The D80 was OK, but definitely did not warrant all of the praise that people heaped on it.The D300 is a usable camera.  First, the noise has been greatly improved at higher ISOs.  I shoot a lot of available light and indoors, and I no longer fear going over 400 ISO, as I did with the D80.  I get usable shots every time at 1600 ISO. That's plenty fast for any indoor shots as well.The D300 is well sealed.  I shoot in a humid climate (San Francisco fog), and the D80 would get moisture in the body.  The D300 is tight as a drum.The review screen is amazingly bright and clear.  Again, a vast improvement.I would recommend the D300 highly to anyone.  This is coming from someone who gave the D80 only 3 stars.  There is no comparison between the two cameras.

$review_text.: This is a very good product - for those that complain that Windows 7 is not touch friendly they simply have not tried a proper Windows 7 tablet.  The build quality of the eee slate is excellent - the aluminum around the edge of the screen and sides is a single piece and is very sturdy; the beautiful glass screen is strong and allows you to press down hard without worrying about it breaking.  I think Asus really should have wrapped the aluminum around to the back of this device as well - they used a textured plastic to give it a grip but I also think they did this to cut some costs.  If you are charging $1100 for this device there should be zero cutting costs at all - make this as attractive as possible = less plastic.The device include wireless b/g/n and bluetooth - all work excellently and asus includes software to turn off the wifi and bluetooth individually as well as an airplane mode to turn all off with one button press.The pen works just as it should - pixel accuracy and you can draw with precision as there is a built in wacom digitizer in this screen.  The slate comes with artrage studio demo software and allows you to test out the tablet fully.Asus ships this device using 125% DPI setting but I switched it back to 100% so text and applications arent stretched; many developers simply dont make their applications properly dpi aware so Windows 7 scales them using its own built in scaler method - while this is okay it makes text somewhat blurry and images jaggy.  Something developers really need to focus on and implement as even dpi is important for 30 inch screens.This isnt really a tablet that should be used like an ipad - you certainly can browse the web, check/write emails and do everything on the ipad with this but it will take more screen taps and the user interface is definaely built more for a mouse.  That being said when browsing the internet and you run into flash videos they work fine provided the tablet is in landscape mode - if you switch it to portrait mode most of the time flash video is cut off - even if you try to pinch/zoom in on the page the flash video is still cut off and you cant view the entire video.  This tablet is really better used in landscape mode.This isnt a light weight tablet, its heavy.  You really will need to put this in your lap while you use it.Windows 7 Experience Index Scores:Processor - 5.6Memory (RAM) - 5.6Graphics - 3.3Gaming graphics - 4.7Primary hard disk: 5.9Base Score (lowest subscore) - 3.3--  NegativesThe only negative I could find about this device is that Asus should have waited for the Sandy Bridge processor was out.  The graphics performance on this device is really lacking and so is the battery life.  Hopefully Asus creates another Windows 7 tablet in the future which uses the Intel Sandy Bridge processor - it will improve graphics up to what the nvidia 320 gpus could do and also would improve battery life tremendously.  You will see random frame drops when viewing 720p content on this device - it happens occassionly but not so often that it is bothersome - probably 1-2 times every 10 minutes; and typically on fast action scenarios in a movie.  This is really more to do with the graphics performance of intels onboard video; if Asus puts out a Sandy Bridge version then there will be no frame drops or freezing at all.  Gaming is okay on this device, I could play games like angry birds and world of goo (both touch friendly) without issue but if you try with more intense games it will be difficult and laggy - something nvidias 320 gpu can easily do and something the new intel sandy bridge processors will be able to accomplish.Battery life is around 3 hours and 30 minutes, you may be able to squeeze a little more if you use power saver mode.  Again if Asus puts out a sandy bridge version of this tablet that battery performance will also increase.All in all this is an excellent device, but was built a little too early; if Asus upgrades this device with an intel sandy bridge cpu it will be easily a 5/5 star product.

$review_text.: Exactly as advertised!Basically what this does is limit the frame to minimize flare that you can't otherwise remove, saving post-processing time. The rubber is soft and does provide additional protection as well. I also feel it added a more professional look to my DLSR (XTi), in all 3 positions. Threads are perfect, and fit, finish and function are as well. For the price, and perhaps at any price, the most I could have asked for.Bonus: arrived a week before promised date (free shipping), with order complete! What more could one want?

$REVIEW.: When you buy a cable, you want something that works. Thankfully, this one does.Unfortunately, build quality is on the cheap side. The DP side locks in place, but the plastic it is made out of feels chintzy and cheap. The connection is OK, but if you want this as a solution to say, be semi-mobile with a laptop, find something else. My use is fairly stable and doesn't move around, so the connection this provides is exactly what I want. The cheap price helps.I haven't run into any sync issues with the display and no problems with dropped data. Works as expected, just a little cheaply built.

Just as other reviewers stated, you plug in the card and pick the driver from the CD (do not use their software, just the driver!), the computer installs the driver and within two minutes it is ready to go. It received a strong signal from my modem and the connection is fast. I watched a video and it streamed very satisfactory! I will buy two more for my other computers, and the price is right, too!

These are not the old days.  This is a great product.  I keep forgetting to put it my lap when I recline.  Love it.  Mouse is excellent feel, but a little heavy; 2 AA batteries weighs more than my old mouse.  Of course, my old mouse sucked; I'm just arthritic. .  I do not have the sensitivity problems with the the buttons.  Recommend highly if you pay under $60.  No more..  but cool product.  Fired up right out of the box; software installation clunky.  but it is ok. You just can't go wrong.  Beats the hell out of the Microsoft products.

$review_text.: This is the best set of headphones I have ever invested in
 The SE310 is worth $250.00, and with the lower price on Amazon it is still worth over $250.00


 You won't believe the highs and the lows

 If any person rates this product lower than a five...he or she doesn't know anything about sound

 I am not a sound perfectionist, however, compared to the highest end headphone I have tried out this is by far the best
 I also like the sorter cord because knowing how hard I am with all my earbuds, I feel these will never break on the cord level


 The two year warranty is just an added plus.If you don't enjoy these as much as I do, I feel there is nowhere else to go except down


 I recommend these to any person that wants fabulous sound


 The price tag of under $150 from Amazon is a bonus

 Love em...StevePS

 I welcome your opinions...agree or disagree...In addition, there are so many different sizes included, one will find the rubber that fits perfectly in the ear


 I don't care if your ears are the size of an elephant or the size of a small cat, there is a rubber plug for you in the SE3110 noise reduction earphones


 No need to complain that these plugs can possibly fall out if you use the correct size for your ear


 I counted four sets including the one that is attached to the ear bud itself.

I send ONLY the jpgs to the laptop and it takes about 2 to 5 seconds to transfer them each.I use my regular home network and also direct mode when necessary.It works like a charm for solving this problem, and I'd recommend it to anyone in my situation.When I have a shot, or a set of shots that I believe are worth &#34;finishing off&#34; then I only download those raw files to the laptop.One side benefit of this approach is that if you shoot some informal shots in jpg and you are only emailing them to relatives or posting them on FB then the small size works great for that application.I know that transferring raw files takes about 15 to 20 seconds each and for me...I wouldn't do it unless I had to.

The bass response is much better and the overall sound quality and crispness is exceptional. I had debated going with a pair of Klipsh over the ear headphones to get a little more bass but hesitated given the bulkiness. I'm glad I didn't go that route. These produce all the nuances of the music as well as solid bass response in a way more portable form factor.

$REVIEW.: Really neat case case for the ipad; looks nice and very functional. One half of the case hugs the ipad from the back and has a swivel mechanism. The other half has a magnetic strip to turn off the ipad when closed. Together they offer a bit of protection and also excellent functionality - better than the apple ipad cover. For example, the swivel back allows keeping the ipad vertical or horizontal and type or view the screen. Do keep in mind that this will protect your ipad from scratches, but not from drops (as others have pointed out, works well with ipad2, but no so good with the newer ones).

ONce you get the set as closs to your liking as possible, then you'll want to go to your Windows desktop setting and fine tune it the rest of the way

Go through the Clear Text setting, as well as the Color setting


You'll be glad you did, trust me
ONCe all this is done, you'll still notice that the blacks are still not coming across as true black
There is just too much lighting for this to be possible.I have mine set up using the HDMI port and have not tried any of the others so I can't tell you if the picture changes accordingly or not.

The USB connector is low-profile so you don't have to worry about it bumping into stuff or getting damaged. I leave mine plugged in constantly, but if you need to use it on multiple computers, you can tuck the USB connector into the mouse (in with the battery).The scroll wheel works well and the tilt-clicks default to back/forward for web-browsing.

The remote has simple buttons: Watch TV, Listen to Radio, Watch DVD, Play a CD. You program the remote by connecting it to your PC (in my case, a Mac) and through a fairly geeky process, set up the remote to match your components (Logitech has a huge database with info on every component known to man!). You'll need to tweak some settings but once you learn how, it's fairly easy. Once you're done, the Harmony remote replaces your coffee table full of remotes. Very liberating.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased the 40-150mm to keep on my E-620 as the "everyday" lens. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I am downright glad I bought this lens. It does not only deliver super sharp images with great detail, it is light and really "unobtrusive" -- you can put it in your cargo pocket and you won't even know it's there. And don't be fooled, this may be a "cheap" lens in dollar terms but it delivers one heck of a job! I shoot JPEG with little post-production fiddling. Between this lens and the minor fiddling (auto contrast, sharpen, saturation) my initial batch of both "test" and regular captures came out five-star. Olympus has a reputation for producing highest quality glass for good reason. This little guy, all-plastic construction, just gets down to work and delivers the goods without any complaints. The duo-cam design, i.e. two inner lens tubes, could be a cause for slight worry sometimes, but this 40-150mm stands unfazed: operation is smooth and could even earn the term "silky." The AF speed may not satisfy wartime photographers rushing to capture the firefight, but for our civilian, peacetime purposes this little guy is ready, willing and able. I have discovered no problems with distortion and vignetting. Minor hitch is depth-of-field (not up to scratch). But, overall, this Zuiko earns my 5 stars hands down. The price is more than right and quality is way above some much more expensive glass I use with other camera systems. Do yourself a favor: go get the 40-150mm now -- if you don't own it already!

Some DVD-R discs had problems playing with this player.2


For some reason, sometimes I had a hard time playing regular DVDs clearly

(Image cracks sometime.)3

Even though DVD discs play well, still the images were not clear enough

I can see lines on the picture.4


If turning off and turn on again, I always have to start from the beginnning

It means the player cannot remember the last point that I was watching which is very annoying.And of course there was no HDMI system.The new Phiilips DVD players that I got has all the good things that Toshiba did not had.First, prograssive scan can make the DVD image at least 5 times better even without hooking with HDMI code but with Coaxial wire

I haven't use HDMI wire yet


I am very anxious to.Second, it remembers the last point that I was watching
(This is so normal but since  my previous DVD player didn't, so I felt so nice.)Third, it has a various sound options to improve my home theater system.Fourth, It shows the whole running time include hours and minutes, secondes which also Toshiba didn't had.But one thing I do not like is it takes some time to boot when turning it on


Let's say three times slowrt than usual
But it is acceptable.Also size is a bit too long

$REVIEW.: This mounting arm provides me with 3 very useful functions, any one of which would have warranted buying it. I had not purchased one earlier because the similar mounts I was encountering were marginal at best.1. I have a dual monitor setup on a straight desk (vs a wrap-around).  Consequently the second monitor is getting out of reading range, especially on its far side.  This arm allows me to pull the monitor closer to me, creating the wrap-around effect, pushing it back when I am not using it.2. I have a several applications that have numerous toolbars and bottom panes, substantially shrinking the working window.  While this is not that much of a hassle while creating the first draft, during revisions I routinely find myself wasting lots of time managing which toolbars and panes are visible.  This arm allows me to pivot a wide-screen monitor into portrait mode (you also need to do a simple Control-Panel configuration change).  A window that is 78% taller (1920 vs 1080) overall can more than double the non-toolbar area inside such a window.3. Sitting, not just inactivity, for too long is bad for your health. With this arm, I can raise and tilt the monitor to a position where I can easily read documents while standing.  OK, a few inches higher would be perfect, but this is much more than good enough (I am 5'10").  It adjusts smoothly, both up-and-down (after simple adjustment of tension) and tilting.Stability: The base is _much_ larger than that of many competing products (see below) and this provides excellent gripping power on the desk and stability even at the extreme extensions of the arm.Construction: Very solidly built. Only exception is that plastic cover on the upper arm, although not fragile, seems like it would break if you gripped it hard in certain places.  Since most people will tend grab the monitor itself to reposition it, this is likely to be at worse a minor, avoidable inconvenience.  However, be aware if you are in the minority.Tension adjustment for arm: Easy and not overly sensitive.  I made the adjustments so that my monitor was not visibly moving immediately after I released it and that was good enough: 12 hours later the arm was in the same position (no creep)."Cable management system" is one of those examples of unnecessary marketing exaggerations: You can slide the cables into the plastic cover on the upper arm and then secure them with cable ties to the lower arm and post (two cable ties provided).  One illustration shows cables being routed through the holes in the lower arm, but those holes are too narrow for connectors for DVI, VGA or power to pass through (HDMI fits). The plastic cover on the upper arm seems designed to accommodate only two cables--power and video. They can be popped in simply by pressing on the seam in the middle of the cover.  However, a third cable can be inserted by starting it at one end and slipping the insertion point to the other.  What is the third cable? A USB cable for a webcam or built-in USB hub.  Or a second video cable so that the monitor can be switched between two computers. If both video cables are HDMI, there is some room left but if they are the thicker DVI and VGA cables, there is very little room to spare.VESA-D mounts: The plate on the arm is 75mm and onto that you can screw a plate for a 100mm mount.  It seems like forever since I saw a 75mm mount and all the adapters I have seen recently have both 75mm and 100mm holes on the same plate, but apparently there are situations where such a dual-purpose plate would cause problems.Hardware: All the hardware was present and easily identified from the instructions.  The only tool not included was a Phillips-head screwdriver (for the VESA-D mount screws). Most of the screws needed Allen (hex) wrenches, which are supplied, but the instructions do _not_ specify the size to use.  This is not a problem during initial installation--because the choice of the provided wrenches is trivial--but could be an annoyance for some during de/re-installation when you have to find the appropriate ones in your toolbox.Instructions: My evaluation unit came with photocopies stapled on the upper left corner, so they may not be the absolute final version. The instructions are overly terse and some of the drawings took some puzzling over to understand the intent.  For someone mechanically inclined, such as me, they are more than adequate because they serve only as a sanity check on what seems obvious.  However, based on experience helping people assemble similar items, these instructions may give them pause or worse (details follow).I installed the arm on the side of the desk (I don't have a grommet hole, which is an alternative).  To _fully_ slide the clamp over the desk requires roughly 3 inches of clearance under the desk, but my desk has only the common 2-inch clearance (to the support bar).  Since the underneath clamp plate was only 2 inches wide, I decided to install it where the post would be close to the monitor rather than having the arm extended from the back--low vs high torque--even though the back provide the full 3-inch clearance.  With the 2-inch clearance, the clamp was absolutely stable--I suspect I could move the desk using the post as a handle.  I am a bit surprised that 3M doesn't include the clearance-needed in its product spec, and advice about positioning the post. So if you are recommending this to someone, pass on this additional info.Aside: The plate is 3 inches long, providing lots of surface in contact with the underneath of the desk. Notice that most of the foot (on top of the desk) is away from the edge (unlike some other models), and consequently a 1-inch gap does not significantly decrease its holding power.Comparative: The oblong clamp plate (underneath) is _much_ larger than the corresponding disks widely used on competing products.  And the "feet" on top create a _much_ larger base than most competing products, which often have bases that are only modestly larger than the post.My monitor is roughly 14 pounds (arm rated for 20) and it is more stable on the arm than on the stand it came with.I did need to make two adjustments, and they were easy but inadequately documented.  The first was one that virtually everyone will need to make: It is to increase the tension on the upper arm to correspond to the weight of my monitor (to keep it from drifting up or down).  The too-terse instructions don't tell you that you need to raise the arm to its upper position to get the access hole to line up with the adjustment screw (although this is hinted at in the drawing).  A mechanically inclined person will quickly figure this out, but others may give up after initially failing.Aside: This is actually good _design_ because you should be making this adjustment at the upper position because this is where the coiled spring that provides the least tension to support the monitor.The second was an adjustment that most won't need to make: The ring on the post was in the middle which wasted much of the vertical extension range: The bottom of my monitor could be extended to below the desktop (useless), but I couldn't raise it enough to comfortably read while standing (or be visible over my shoulder).  The adjustment itself was trivial--one screw using a provided Allen wrench--but it wasn't included in the instructions for this model, although it was if you looked at the instructions for a related model.  The adjustment screw wasn't readily identifiable as such--it could have been a rivet--until I inserted one of the provided Allen wrenches.  Note that if _you_ don't want to be able to raise the monitor high, you want to leave the ring position unchanged (because it puts less torque on the post and clamp).Details: I raised the ring to 2.75 inches from the top of the post, leaving 1 inch of post above the arm socket (for earthquake bounce).  This position allowed me to position the _middle_ of the monitor from roughly 7 inches above the desk through 20 inches above.The tension adjustment requires some turning power and a large Allen wrench with a large T-handle is provided to make this easy.  Since there is no obvious place to store the wrench on the arm, you probably want to label it so that you remember its purpose.Portrait mode: Rotation is clock-wise and the stops are noticeably beyond horizontal and vertical, so if this friction fit (between plates) loosens with use, there could eventually be a problem. My suspicion is that this design is based on the expectation that most people will leave the monitor in either landscape or portrait mode and not be occasionally switching between the them.Time in use: 1 week, but the construction is so solid that I don't expect wear-and-tear problems for a long time (with landscape/portrait being the possible exception).

My buds broke off after a few uses. The older ear sets were much better!The forward & back "button" was one piece, I prefer the distinct buttons, especially @ night.All in all, this is still my favorite pocket radio. This model has been discontinued @ CC Radio & replaced w/ more expensive model. I was very pleased Amazon still offers this excellent radio!

$review_text.: First of all, these headphones have great sound.  I'm no audiophile and I don't own a significant number of wireless headphones so I'm not the best to judge whether they are the best in their class as far as sound goes.  They are decently comfortable, but the cup size is just slightly too small for my ears.  The range works really well for me, through walls and other things with lots of interference.Lots of people have reviewed these features and I find that I'm not going to add anything to them so I will start with what I find intensely annoying about these headphones.1)  No auto off/power-saving on the HEADPHONES.  That's right, you lay down the headphones one day and pick them up the next the headphones will be dead, hope you weren't planning on listening to them.  I'm unable to comprehend why Sennheiser thought lack of power save or auto off would be ok in a pair of battery operated headphones.  The headphones don't even eventually turn off when you turn off the base and there is absolutely no signal.2) Auto-off on the BASE.  You have to turn on the headphones and the base every time you use the headphones.  When the headphones are turned off eventually the base (which is plugged into the wall) will turn off.  If you put the headphones on the charger it will turn off the headphones which means the base will eventually power off.  It does not turn back on when you remove or turn on the headphones, you have to do that via a separate button on the base.  The only explanation I can come up with for this backwards design is that the engineer that was supposed to put the power-save feature in the headphones concluded there wasn't enough room in there for the circuitry so they put it in the base instead?3) Easy to break the ear cups.  If you run out of battery at least you can replace it.  The ear cups twist to the side.  This mechanism can either be really loose and easy to remove or sometimes it is like you super-glued the ear cup on.  If you force the ear cup the little plastic tabs will break and you will need to purchase new ones.  They are difficult to find, take a while to ship and are expensive.  So be really careful.In all I like the headphones and the mobility they provide.  These usability features make the headphones considerably less desirable in my estimation and I wouldn't pay so much for the same pair again.  When I bought one pair I liked the range and quality so much I went out and purchased another pair.  However, if I had used them enough I wouldn't have.
$SUMMARY.: Great sound/range and good comfort the rest of the experience leaves a lot to be desired

This only covered 125,000 of the 919 Billion, but luckily I have great credit and got a loan with only 2% annual interest.While the loan will be manageable, I have had trouble enjoying these subs to their full capabilities because I now live in an apartment and the landlord is not letting me install these subs into the wall.

$review_text.: This isn't the most sensitive 802.11b adapter I've ever used, but it's certainly not the worst either, which is saying something given its diminutive profile.  Hence, if you need the maximum range from your wireless adapter, this isn't the one for you, but it your needs are 'typical,' you'll be fine.It works without problems for me under Windows 2000 and Windows XP; I haven't tried it under any other OS.I do have the disconnect/re-connect problem every now and again that other people have mentioned, but I've seen it with other adapters as well; it generally happens when you are in the 'borderline' area of servicibility.  I believe it's due to Windows dropping the connection when the adapter reports that its signal strength has (temporarily due to normal variations) fallen to just about nothing; this seems like something that software could address, as it is annoying.

 Every 60 seconds, it drops the connection and reconnects in about 5 seconds


 So this adapter is fairly useless for online games, streaming mp3's from another pc on the network, SSH connections, or anything else that requires constant connections.The ugly:  It seems as if NetGear has completely abandoned this product!  The software download page makes you guess which driver is the right one, and it hasn't been updated in forever..
 Maybe there's just not a way to fix it...My verdict:  If you just want to browse the web, and you can pick one up cheap, go for it
 But with Linksys adapters selling for the same price, I can't see why you would.

$review_text.: I'm a former educator and used MAC desktop computers way back in the 90's. After I stopped teaching, I became accustom to PC's. When I bought my first iPad, I decided to give MAC's another try. I can't recall why I ever stopped using them. My best guess is the price. Now I'm hooked on MACs. My work computer is a PC and I don't even like using it anymore. I bought this MAC after I went back to school to get my doctorate degree. When school is in session and I have to travel for work, I carry my work laptop (because I have to) and my MAC just so I can complete my coursework and not have to use my work PC to do it. I won't get into all of the technical comparisons of MACs and PCs; others have already done that. I'll simply say that it's user friendly, easy navigation, the mouse pad is much better than those on PCs (I typically use an external mouse with PCs, but I only use the mouse pad with my MAC) and the keyboard is more comfortable.

$REVIEW.: Having had many other small cameras in the past -- from tiny Minoxes to the latest Kyocera S3 -- I was really looking forward to having a small digital camera I could keep with me at all times.The Dimage X is a stunning little package; anyone who sees it wants to pick it up, hold it, and play with it.  The design and finish are first-rate. The size, though -- that's what this camera is all about.  It's the first digicam to use an internal zoom mechanism, which allows the X to be ridiculously slim.  Other cameras might have a slightly smaller &quot;footprint&quot; but the X wins where it counts -- it is so slim you forget it's in your pocket.  As a result it is very easy to keep with you at all times.The Dimage X works very well in daily use.  The most important convenience is its' speed.  Many other cameras simply take too long to turn on, or have very long wait times as they record an image.  The little Minolta is among the swiftest of cameras in these regards.  It also allows you to fire off several frames in rapid succession; it appears to allow around five pictures, then pauses to record them to memory.  This is very handy when your trying to capture something elusive -- children, for example.The X's lithium-ion batteries give what I consider very long run-times before expiring.  In comparison to another small digicam, the Kyocera S3, the Dimage X offers approximately double the battery life.  It gives ridiculously long run times with the LCD display switched off; the camera's internal electronics seem very well designed and appear to operate very efficiently.  The camera never feels hot to the touch (or even warm, for that matter); I noticed this was a problem with the Kyocera, which may account for it's short run-times.The only thing I dislike about the Dimage X is its' image quality.  To keep the zoom mechanism inside the camera required the use of a prism.  This limits the camera from being as sharp, ultimately, as a conventional camera, and also leads to slightly less contrast and color saturation in the images.To qualify this review I should admit to being a perfectionist who is reluctant to EVER compromise on image quality.  In this case the size and packaging of this camera have won me over.  With further refinement the Minolta Dimage X could approach perfection; as it stands it's one great little camera that will accompany you everywhere.

$review_text.: My first impression after having this installed was that the dynamic range was noticeably lower than the Pioneer DEH-P6900UB it replaced. I listened with the same flash drive loaded with the same audio files I was using before having it replaced. It is connected to the same amps and is playing back through the same speakers.Right out of the box, the Alpine's highs are comparatively muted and rolled off. I don't hear the natural sound of cymbal decay for example as I did with the Pioneer. The mids and low end are excellent but with a muted high end, the overall presentation is a little disappointing. I spent some time in the advanced eq section but so far haven't been able to find a natural sounding high end. I'll have to spend more time with the advanced eq options. Maybe I'll find the sweet spot. If I do, I'll update this review.On the upside, the controls are excellent and intuitive. I couldn't be happier with how well thought out and easily accessed they are. There's also a bookmarking feature which makes this an ideal system for listening to audio books, podcasts and other spoken word files. But that's not enough. Audio quality is my top priority and on that count, this unit is somewhat of a disappointment - so far. I did not buy this from Amazon (wish I had for the return policy but wanted an experienced installer to take care of it). If you're looking for the last word in d/a conversion, this may not be it.Update: traded for a Pioneer DEH-80PRS after ~3 weeks of ownership. As good as this unit is in most areas, the sound quality was just shy of great.

$review_text.: I bought this mouse for my brother-in-law for Christmas.  He loves it.  I own two myself, and have had them for several months.  I work for a computer software company and spend about 70% of my waking hours on a computer.  I have two laptops.  I bought one of these for the first laptop and liked it so much I bought anpther one for the second laptop.Pros:1. The tiny dongle is GREAT!  I travel A LOT.  I constantly am packing my laptop up and now I never have to remove a USB attachment to do so.  That alone makes it worth every penny.2. Compact design isn't as bulky as other mice I have had.3. Runs on a single AAA battery that after 4 months of constant use has not needed replacing.4. Has a power switch to conserve that battery.5. Has a double optical sensor that reacts perfectly.  This mouse works on every surface I put it on.  Past optical mice have had issues on certain shiny surfaces, but this one seems to handle everything just fine so far.6. The scroll wheel has two settings, a clicking spin and a free spin.  The free spin zips right through long web pages and huge documents.Cons:1. None that I have noticed yet, and by now I should have.Maybe someone could gripe about the price, but there are more expensive mice on the market that I have tried and not liked.  And again, the small dongle is such a huge convenience for someone that travels that I would pay more for this mouse if I had to.I can't imagine anyone not loving this mouse.

$REVIEW.: I was excited to try the Memorex TagAlong out, since I have access to a couple of different iPods from different generations
Unfortunately, the TagAlong wouldn't work with my super old, click wheel, third generation iPod


When I attached it to the charger, the battery indicator dropped from full to zero and the iPod said that there was no charge remaining

This happened twice, so I was never able to test it to see how navigation and volume would work
I then tried using my wife's iPod classic (6th generation) and it had issues of its own (it has some strange problem with the screen blacking out and the device only staying powered when plugged in to an outlet.) preventing me from testing it on the TagAlong
That left me with FM reception for my initial tests and unfortunately I couldn't pick up any local stations.Finally, I attached a Phillips mp3 player via the line-in and played some tunes


Overall, the sound is decent especially for background music in a small office, the kitchen, or a garage/shed workspace


I could see this being used on outings, like picnics or trips to the beach
That said, I didn't test how long the unit lasts on battery power.The sound is lean and kind of boxy; mids are alright, the trebles is slightly over powering, and the bass is almost nonexistent
However, this is a functional portable iPod player and plays at volumes acceptable in a variety of situations.

$REVIEW.: I'm in a sub-1000sqft unit in a high rise building less than 5 years old -- all the big systems that put interesting loads on the electrical supply (elevators, air conditioning, etc) are far, far away from me


As such, I'd expect to get something remotely close to advertised speeds..

right?Not so much; 3-4MB/sec is typical -- which is to say that the powerline transmission is actually my bottleneck getting out to the Internet; it's *slower* than my cable-modem link to the outside world!If this weren't more reliable than sharing wireless spectrum with my neighbors, it would have been directly returned


However, while slow, it _is_ a reliability improvement, so it stays..

$review_text.: I usually put a little Windex on a paper towel to clean my electronics, and I honestly expected this Surface Screen Cleaner to be glorified window cleaner with a nice little microfiber cloth.  I was wrong.  It cleans everything much better. It's quick, truly streak-free, and odorless.You just spray a little on the cloth and have at your electronics.  My computer is recovered daily with fingerprints and cat nose-prints on the inside and out and after I cleaned the screen and keyboard, I went ahead and wiped down the outside.  The cleaner was up to the task and even made the matt silver of my MacBook gleam, something Windex could never do.  I cleaned my iPhone and the TV screen, and then took it to my friend's house where we cleaned our cameras, her computer, her wireless house phones and some of her husband's gadgets.  We went through very little of the cleaner and are extremely happy with the results.My only quibble doesn't affect the five stars: I'd just like more information on the label. It contains no alcohol or ammonia. It doesn't name the active ingredient, but does say to keep it out of reach of children.  Perhaps that's because they could swallow the cap? Or is it the ingredient?  I'd like to know simply because I wouldn't want my pets licking something harmful.

$review_text.: This device is doing EXACTLY what it is supposed to be doing, and I am loving it as long as it stays this way!I've had DLink and Linksys in the past that claim to do the job of an ethernet adapter and more, but fall short of consistently performing the job that this guy does flawlessly!The Belkin underdog is the champ of wireless products on the market today...My Setup:Starts with the Belkin Pre-N router (8230-4) for tremendous range and speed with our existing wireless PCs.Next, on the other end of the house, this device (7330) receives the signal from the Pre-N router and delivers it to the internet port of my Belkin WirelessG router (7230-4) which cost me a whole $9.99 at Circuit City (after mail-in rebates).  And I am happy :-)A few sidenotes here, I forced the Pre-N router to operate on channel 11 and the WirelessG router to operate on channel 1 to avoid each other as much as possible.  Also I could've went with an access point vs. a second router, but it provides a nice double firewall and keeps prying family eyes out of my business.  Plus my only other Belkin choice would be their 7130 access point, but it is an older device, and has received some questionable reviews.  The 7130 also supposedly doubles as an ethernet adapter (or bridge) in conjunction with other Belkin products only, but there does not appear to be a Site Survey incorporated to survey the wifi signals in the surrounding area.  The 7330 does incorporate this feature!When speed testing a PC wired to my WirelessG router, I get speeds of 3.0Mbps which is the best Time Warner Cable of Hawaii is doing right now, (even though they are claiming 5.0).  So this speedy signal is twisting it's way through each of my 3 Belkin devices with ease!  And never SLOWS DOWN!  It's a home network enthusiasts dream, man!Happy Wireless Networking! (with Belkin, the best)

$REVIEW.: TheSabrent Premium 4 Port Aluminum USB Hubis both beautiful and fully functional for Mac users.Designed from Aluminum, this hub is sleek and blends with just about any desk environment


 The unit transfers data as expected with really great results

 This hub is perfect for those with few USB ports get gain a net increase of 3 additional USB ports for your Mac

 Perfect if you are on the go and often need to sync multiple devices in a short period of time


 The slim design of this hub makes it perfect for tossing in a computer bag for doing work on the road.Setup for this hub is really easy with the plug and play design


 The unit began functioning after just a couple seconds after plugging it in

 Although the USB ports on this hub are unpowered, that does not hamper the transfer speed and I find the performance is really great.Overall, this hub looks good and functions great

 An impeccable addition to any Mac whether on the go or for daily use with a desktop machine

 Truly a perfect match.Disclosure: I want you to know I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review

$REVIEW.: The cord cover has enough space inside to hold lots of cables, in fact maybe TOO MUCH space

 That's why I gave it a 4 out of 5 rating
 I have a TV power cable, soundbar power cable, 2 HDMI cables, and composite cable running through the cord cover


 It looks like there's enough space left over to run double the amount of cables

 I would have preferred it to be smaller

 There's no need for a cord cover this large unless you're using component cables, which I think few people prefer to HDMI cables


 On the positive side, it does look nice, was easy to install, and does the job of covering my cables.

$review_text.: Not sure what I can say about this stuff. It works, it was easy to apply, the applicator worked properly. I did my homework before buying and this stuff was tops on the lists.Be sure to watch a bunch of videos on how to put this stuff on your cpu chip. There are many schools of thought on this process. The one I liked best was the one on YouTube that proved to me that placing a pea sized ball of Thermal Grease in the middle of the chip WITH OUT SMEARING IT AROUND WITH YOUR FINGER was the best way to get a uniform coverage with no low spots. He used a piece of clear plastic to show this on camera and sold me. He did examples of applying it both ways and you can clearly see the shortcomings of smearing it around - you get pockets that do not contact the chip to the cooling surface.I guess I'll try to follow up in 4 years to let you all know wether this stuff held up or not - LOL

The BookArc may has well have been made by Apple because it works so well with the MacBook Pro that you'd think it came with the laptop.  The only thing holding it back from a 5 star rating is that you have to power the laptop on while open and then close the lid before docking.  And that's more the laptops fault.

$REVIEW.: If you have a black computer case, have several fans and your motherboard does not do a good job controlling them, this is the solution.The panel provides connectors for 5 fans and 5 temperature probes, attached to different parts of your system by adhesive tape. If you pair probes with fans correctly, the "auto" mode selectively controls fans to optimize temperature.What I don't like about it: first, it beeps when you touch the screen. When you are building a silent PC, it's not such a great idea. I did not find a way to turn the beeping off. Second, you cannot set up target temperatures, so "auto" mode does what it does, there's no way to make it smarter. Third, it does not control PWM fans (4-pin fans) even if they provide a 3-pin connector. Last, it can set any fan to 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40% and 0%. That's right, there are no stops between 0% and 40%.

In the case of my Dell Latitude E6410, I was able to insert it (yes, it's tight) and I was able to remove it without problem. I plan to leave it inserted permanently, but I did not want it to be stuck in there anyway.Other than that, I connected my new Western Digital Passport 1.0 TB USB 3.0 hard drive to it and it works well. I can tell that file transfers are indeed much faster than with my previous WD 320 GB USB 2.0 Passport drive, but I have not done any quantitative measurements.

$review_text.: I bought this rear view camera to be used on my Pioneer Car AVHP4000DVD Double Din AV Multimedia Receiver that I have on my Lancer 2008.The camera images look GREAT, it also has infrared sensors for an AMAZING night vision, you don't even need your reverse lights to be turned on to see in complete darkeness, I can ASSURE you that.It is waterproof, and this feature I did test it already, since it rains a lot in my country and haven't had a single problem with the camera.UPDATE: 2 years later, this low budget camera is still working great.  The only thing I've noticed is that when the camera gets too much sun light, the image may get a little red/pink and I guess is because of the IR sensors. Once it cools down, the image is displayed correctly.  Anyway, couldn't ask a $20-$40 camera to be ultra high quality so I'm still glad with the purchase.  If anyone else had problems with "water", you surely got a deffective product, I take my car to the carwash every week (they wash it with high pressure water) and it rains a lot in here, not a single problem with water so far.

The design allowed me to securely handle my iPad while grocery shopping and editing pictures, while I was on the go. My son used the included moviewall clip to hang the iPad on the wall in his room. This made him feel as if he had two TVs in his room...one to watch movies and the other for playing videos. The hard shell screen cover has provided extra protection from scratches and accidental dings.

$review_text.: Didn't really need on of these  but I got one out of curiosity I'm glad I did I love it. It works out the box on my laptop just plug and play I prefer to use rechargeable batteries. The mouse could use some work takes some getting used to not a deal breaker though also removing the battery cover is a bit of a hassle despite the two insignificant "cons" it's a great product to have if you want to have a replacement mouse/keyboard wish i personally had more use for it though I'm only using on laptop.P.s. On the mouse issue I'm sure you can tweak it depending on your OS but I haven't messed with any settings wasn't a big issue for me but YMMV.I received a sample for a honest and unbiased review.

$REVIEW.: Okay, the only reason why I got a Nexus 7 was because I was incredibly disappointed with the Kindle Fire HD


I was given the first generation Kindle Fire last year as a gift and I couldn't be more happy with it
 BUT, the gripes with the Kindle Fire using a 'custom' Android version was very limiting

So I thought that getting a Kindle Fire HD would be a bit of an upgrade


But it's basically the same tablet with a slightly faster CPU, a tad better screen and better speaker locations

But aside from that, very limited to the Amazon appstore and the custom Android system on it
 Also, being limited to only Amazon's app store felt little too much like Apple's stranglehold on their customers to use only apps from their Apple Store


Hence, I returned the Kindle Fire HD and got the Nexus 7

First thing off the bat is that it is FAST

 The combination of a quad-core CPU along with Jellybean 4.1 is a noticeable difference compared to the Kindle Fire HD's 'custom' Android 4.0 Ice Cream

I got the 16gb version because a friend of mine got the 8gb version and right off the bat, 4gb is used up by the tablet, leaving you with actually about 4gb

So, getting the 16gb resulted in 12gb+ of actual usage

I downloaded the Kindle app for the Nexus 7 and it's basically the same app for the Kindle Fire HD
My only gripe with the Nexus 7 is that there is no microSD slot and no HDMI out


The screen is beautiful

 So far, the best screen I've seen on a mini tablet is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (Amoled Screen)

But side by side, I saw little difference between the screens for the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD
 The speakers are so so on the Nexus 7, yet, I mainly use earphones whenever I listen to anything on any tablet

 For $199 (8gb), it definitely is the best mini tablet out there


 I'm sure that Apple will step up its game by releasing their mini iPad to counter this gem

 We shall see.



$SUMMARY.: It is so far the best mini tablet in the market IMO

$REVIEW.: I have had a variety of Sony Headphones (and others over the years - Sennheiser, Nady, Panasonic, Pioneer, etc.) including the MDR V-700, V-300, V-7506 and others


 These MDR-V900 Monitors though are the best!  I use them for monitoring music, movies, and most importantly, I use them when playing my Bass Guitar at church
 They have a great "boot'en" bottom-end as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction...they simply kick! I paid much more for them than that advertized on Amazon right now and I am considering buying other pairs for my drummer, sound technician, and guitarist for our church group
 My opinion is you can't go wrong with these babies!

$review_text.: While I know there are people on both sides of the Monster like/dislike spectrum, this product is something I really liked. Not only is it small, it holds a descent charge. For my Ipod, it has charged it several times before it dies. Granted, I never left my Ipod die all the way but still.. For my phone, I got a good 75 percent charge off the unit when powering it back up. Considering the alternative is a dead phone, I think that's pretty good. Electronic cigarette charges well off it, too, and I'm sure you can imagine the alternative. The advertisements as being wallet-sized - I'm not so sure about that. It is small, but the average wallet carries items a lot smaller than this. That said, I cannot image trying to put something like that into a wallet in the first place. It does fit well into a jacket pocket, into a work bag, or somewhere small. Being on the road, I find that great because my items don't die.There are other units on the market for different prices, and some are actually more affordable than this one. So, if cost is a heavy factor, you might want to look into those. Having said that, this is the only unit I have utilized so far, and I like it. I would buy another one because it has surpassed my expectations for it.

You can come back later and transcribe them when its more convenient.The voice recorder is also great for taking quick notes when those 'great' ideas pop in to your head!Pros:Great mic sensitivity and clarity of recorded voice, even whispers or reflected sounds.Inexpensive, as far as voice recorders go, but could certainly be cheaper.Has a few 'banks' for storing related recordings as groups. I like to think of them as 'dreams', 'ideas', and 'other'Supports editing, splitting of recordings, and speed controls.Has pause/resume functionality other recorders in this price range do not.Cons:I wish it had a back-light so you can see the screen in the dark, but the red LED indicator and the layout is simple enough to operate in the dark.

$REVIEW.: I had my Acer about a month and I absolutely love my Acer netbook


I do not even use my desktop or my old laptop anymore because the netbook surpasses in every aspects (speed,power,size,portability,reception,screen,price,looks etc...)It is light and slim that I take it with me wherever I go

I got myself a USB tv tuner and watch HD tv and digital channels.Truely One of the best choice for netbook,I chose this because of the best price for the features
250 GB HD with 9 hours batttery life and has one of the highest customer rating (It was $300 with free next day air shipping promotion, no tax of course) I wrote long details about battery life because the manufacture's suggested hours can be confusing.Depending on the usage of your computer the hours can be as high as 9 hours and as low as 5 hours

The battery life of the netbook is the single most important factor of the quality of netbook


If u are like me who is doingmost of the internet surfing, occationally watching movies or u tubes and doing some work on MS office u will mostlikely get around 6 to 7 hours which is good enough for me.*BATTERY LIFE  :  8 to 9 hours ( word and excel, exclude powerpoint)7 to 8 hours (surfing internet only)6 to 7 hours (surfing internet and watching You tubes.)5 to 6 hours (watching movie files and Hulu)  * These tests are under medium *brightness**SCREEN  :  Very bright and sharp


( U will hardly notice that u r looking at only 10 inch screen)*SPEED  :  Much faster than my desktop and my old laptops (booting, reading)*WIRELESS  :  Truely N speed, downloading was 2 or 3 times faster than all my pc I have.*OS  :  Win 7 is as same as Vista and I had no problems of freezing or crashing.*VIDEO  :  No problems of playing Hulu (480 only) movies files, u tubes (no full HD screen mode)*WEIGHT  :  Way lighter and thinner than my 14 inch laptop
u will also like the finish and solid built look.*KEYBOARD  :  fairly decent, much better than HP netbook KB

feels soft and solid.*Multitasking  :  Open up a lot windows had no problems, no hardcore games though.Helpful tips  :  * How to transfer files and programs without using external cd drive.- use one of your USB thumb drive to copy the programs from your old computer,open up the program and drag all the folders to the thumb drive, make sure includethe auto set up icon or set up icon which will automatically install the files toacer netbook


If u don't include that icon u not gonna have the install wizardscreen to guide through the installation

When u done plug in the USB drive to Acerand copy the files and then click the setup icon which will start to install to urhard drive.* How to make ur web browsing almost twice faster than ur IE.- U don't need to add more memory but u do need to change ur web browser to GoogleChrome to the latest version

I've tried Safari, Mozilla firefox, flock
MS IE.The best web surfing that the current tec offers is the Google chrome,this browseris clutter free,no BS popups etc..
But u do need to have MS IE just incase,because some sites either texts are broken or have some ghost images in Chrome.Just have the MS IE on the desktop screen u might need it sometimes.

$SUMMARY.: The best portable laptop.

$review_text.: The bottom line is this remote works extremely well and other should consider the Kameleon. Over several years I have played with many of the multi-device remotes so I can count on only one to operate the various electronic components. None the less you will find some that work with most but not all. The Kameleon has worked with all OUR devices even our digital cable box (General Insturment) from Cox Cable and our Pioneer Elite Home Theatre receiver VSX-24TX. Most common button are in plan site others are in a different location/name but if you are looking for a feature Kameleon has it but probably &quot;hidden&quot;. Take for example the function button on the Pioneer to change where the signal comes from DVD&gt;TV&gt;VCR is the channel button, BUT IT IS THERE already programed. If not the Kameleon is very simple to copy the codes from another remote to a button. This is a keeper to us after testing out RCA, SONY, and Phillips remotes several years ago. If your looking this is one for You to test yourself. Also it is upgradeable over the phone (somehow). This is an edited review after several months of use. The battery life is short so I have gone to rechargeable's and keep an extra handy to swap out. I do wish it was not so senstive to vibration. But it DOES WORK!

$REVIEW.: My 20 year old Domke F-1X still works great but is looking really shabby and coming apart at the seams so I'm replacing it with the same bag. My only complaint is the shoulder strap, I pack my bag full and it offers no padding so I cut it off as soon as the bag arrived and replaced it with a padded strap from Portabrace,Portabrace HB-10 Suede Shoulder Strap (Suede). If you carry your bag a lot you will be really happy you replaced the strap, just remember to turn the seam side up so it's not against your shoulder. Have never understood why Portabrace doesn't put the seam at the edge. Also tried using a backpack camera bag but wasn't happy with it and kept going back to my Domke.

$review_text.: Received today after I had to send the 1st one back because it didn't work straight out of the box(different seller)


 2nd headset worked awesome right from the get go and so far have seen nothing to complain about


 Can't say enough about Amazon and the return of the 1st headset


 I actually got the 1st headset refunded today which I sent back yesterday, Amazon even refunded the 2 day shipping on the 2nd set that I ordered to make sure it got here when I wanted it by
 So received the replacement with refunded 2 day shipping and got the refund for the 1st defective headset same day as replacement arrived!  Amazon is awesome and this LG Tone seems to be awesome as well

 Would purchase this headset again even though 1st one was defective which I believe was "used" and not actually "new" as stated by seller, actuallly did purchase again based on reviews being so good for this headset

 And definately would recommend Amazon to anyone

 It's great to see that a company actually takes care of their customers...that's a dying thing in retail lately

 Great Job Amazon...can't thank you enough for the great service!!!UPDATE:  Have used for a few weeks now and have noticed the the bluetooth connection is not very good with these headphones

 I actually have not had these any further than my pocket and have had them cut out repeatedly!

$review_text.: Pro: light weight, no wires.The buttons are a bit harder to click than what I am used to but it's not so stiff as to be objectionable.The only real con is that the scroll wheel is too tight and too slippery. It needs a lot of force to scroll and may not be good for the finger. Maybe it will help to coat something on the surface of the scroll wheel to increase the coefficient of friction. I will update if I succeed to do that.Update: I coated the wheel with Plasti Dip. Now the coefficient of friction is much higher and the wheel much easier to turn. I looked at two different Logitech mice that I like - they both have rubber coating on the wheels. This HDE cheap mouse doesn't and that's why the (bare plastic) wheel is too slippery. It would be a 5 star but the lack of rubber coating forcing me to DIY takes 2 stars off. It's time consuming: the exposed part is only ~ 1/4 turn of the wheel, and it takes ~ 1/2 hour to dry before coating the next 1/4 turn. So 1 coat = 2 hours, 2 coat = 4 hours. Also Plasti Dip recommends a final 4 hours of curing before use.

$REVIEW.: I can't say enough about this camera.  Before using I suggest that you READ the manual before using and get to know it's features.  Once you have mastered the features and know what it can do there should be NO problems.  The problem with some negative reviews I have seen in other articles/comments about this camera is that people fail to study the manual before they use it.  This is a great little camera and the only things I have to say is that the USB port cover on the camera is somewhat flimsy and I'm afraid I might break it off.  The zoom feature moves a bit too fast to get it exactly where I want it at the moment. That's why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  Other than that it's a great product.

Shipping was fast and it did come in one of those reusable plastic memory card holders unlike another Sandisk microsd I got from Amazon which came in like a 1inch ziplock bag taped to a piece of folded cardborad (lol)


Only issue might be the authenticity of the card it really doesn't look and feel like a real Sandisk card, it's cleary a fake or a really bad quality Sandisk card
It works and it was cheap so meh....

$review_text.: Ignore the bonehead who blew a gasket (below) over a customer service issue, and childishly decided to flame the manufacturer on all of their listings here. Raynox products are well-made, have good optics, and are a good value.This particular macro lens is ->extrememly&lt;- powerful! Because of this it has a ->very&lt;- low depth of field. If you're new to macro photography I might recommend the Nikon 6t, but if you want the most powerful macro lens in its class, go with this one. It uses a spring clip to attach to the lens, which means you don't need to buy step-up/down rings.

$review_text.: Bought this as an add on for the bedroom TV. I just got an Amazon Prime account and enjoy all the new content, however the TV in the bedroom is NOT a smart TV and so a network streamer seemed to be a good choice. I am very pleased with this SONY product and give it a 5-star endorsement. It is simple to hook up and set up right out of the box. You will need to register the device with Sony to activiate your Amazon account on the device, but that was a quick login and activation. Other prominent features like Hulu, Netflix, Pandora, etc were also very easy to activate and the box performs admirably. I can't attest to performance on the Wi-Fi side as I have it set up for a hard-wired connection with enough bandwidth to process HD video. There is no lag in any of the video that I have streamed and the audio seems to sync without any noticed delay. Again a very solid 5-star endorsement.

$review_text.: I'll start off by saying the YES, "for the money" this is a good unit, it has a lot of features. My only complaint is the ARC (Audio Return Channel) volume. But, for me this is a big complaint because this is the only reason I bought it. For some reason the volume through the ARC is much lower than when playing something that is directly sourced on the unit, i.e. BlueRay, YouTube, Amazon Prime Videos. Even turned up to 100 when I am running on my treadmill the volume is not loud. What is even stranger is at first it is loud, then after a while it turns itself down.

I have used it with a video camera, filming soccer games in all types of Chicago weather, with my film type SLR for telephoto stability, and just about the time that my SLIK thought it was in retirement, it is back in operation with a Cannon S5 IS camera.  With minor cleaning she is ready to rock and roll again.  All leg clips, the wing nut and the main spring are in `like new' condition even after years of work.  The SLIK decal is so worn it can barely be read --- a definite sign of an excellent product.

$review_text.: I have a very nice Gitzo tripod with a RRS ballhead that I use for my DSLR.  I wanted to be able to use this same combination with a new spotting scope so I gave this cheap plate a try.  For an affordable arca-swiss plate it doesn't get much better than this.  Yes it does have a few flaws but that is typical of most universal products.  The screw is too much off center and I'm not a fan of a rubberized base material.  My spotting scope already has a rubber base so rubber on rubber didn't offer the solid connection that I'm used to.  My solution?  Remove the rubber material from this plate.

$review_text.: I bought my wife a SD800IS and was looking for another one for one of the kids. I ended up, over time (6 months) picking up 2 more. The 870 replaced the 800 so I now have 2 870's and 1 800. Biggest thing I like about this camera is that it has a wider angle than any of the other ones. Mostly, the wife and kids shoot indoors or in a close setting. The wider angle allows for them to get more into the picture. They take great pictures and if/when we really need a good shot I have a Canon Digital SLR I use. So, it really works out great. They all have loved them, they're fairly easy to operate and if you want to get a bit more advanced, they also have that capability. Obviously, as I now have 3, I'd recommend them to anyone. In a close, say under 50', setting, you really can't tell the difference between their pictures shot with a $250.00+ camera or mine with $3500 between the camera and lense. If you're not planning on blowing them up past about an 8x10 you won't be able to tell the difference. Good luck!!

$review_text.: This is our family's second WiDi adapter

The first one never quite worked, but that was two years ago
Has Intel's WiDi technology improved?Sadly, not that much
In all fairness, I should point out that it's difficult to review and rate WiDi adapters, because the whole WiDi thingy requires both the adapter and the PC that has the WiDi technology to work well together


Case in point, at first I tried to connect to this adapter from my one-year-old Lenovo desktop

I tried for ten minutes without success
After some digging -- and that's after getting really frustrated! -- I realized the WiDi program "Intel Wireless Display" on my Lenovo running Win7 was an older version
Actiontec does tell you that you must have Intel Wireless Display version 3.5 or higher in order to work

I hadn't seen that, and even if I had, I wouldn't have thought that my version of Intel's software was already way out of date.I then tried to connect from my new Toshiba touch ultrabook, and it worked flawlessly
It found the Actiontec right away and after entering the 8-digit PIN and waiting for over a minute for the WPS security check to pass, I was connected.I give five stars to this adapter because it's small yet well built
You just plug in the power cord and the included HDMI cable, then run the Intel software from your PC

 I like the looks of this little guy.Unfortunately, the entire WiDi experience is no more than 3 stars


 I put my Toshiba, which has a latest i5 processor, just a few feet away from my TV and the Actiontec
 I've got full-strength WiFi on the Toshiba

 Yet video played over WiDi is pathetically jerky, even for a 480p video streamed from a popular video site

I haven't tried playing an HD video file yet, and to be honest I'm afraid to even try it, because I feel I'm gonna be really disappointed by something that's unwatchable.I'll be honest with you
I think I'm gonna stick with the HDMI wired connection directly from PC to TV, which is delay-free and you can go full HD


Heck, if you've got a 4k UHDTV you can even go all the way! But I doubt you can do that with a WiDi setup


So I don't see what value WiDi really brings to us
If you just have to have WiDi, I can highly recommend this Actiontec adapter, though!

$review_text.: Got it and hooked it up between my dvd and an hdmi cable coming from my PC to share one input on my TV. Watched a movie and all looked fine...But, when playing the special features, deleted scenes etc or anything else on the disc, the box blacks out the picture(the blue light will come on at that point) for about 2-3 seconds at about an 8 second interval and then comes back on. The audio stays put, but the picture disappears. VERY annoying to the point that I just unhooked it and now there is no problem. I tried it with 3 different dvds. Same effect.Otherwise, the function of this little box seems to work well. No need for a power supply. The IR detector picks up the remote signal great and the switching works fine too.So, I guess if you watch only the movie on a dvd and don't care about the special features ever, this will work for you.

$REVIEW.: The bag is well crafted with impressive canvas and leather prints. Materials used in construction are of the finest quality. It has enoug pockets and punched to carry cables and memory cards, and filters. My only beef with this bag is, its just too small!It comes with a cushioned  case where your camera is suppose to sit but its of absolutely no use for a carrying a DSLR with an attached lens. Maybe it can fit just the camera body but I haven't tried it yet. Even without this case the bag is barely big enough for a DSLR with an attached prime lens. I use it for Nikon D7000 with attached 50mm prime. I have the back of the camera (lcd part) facing the back of the bag and the lens cap the front. The camera with the attached lens cannot be fitted any other way and forget using any 18-55 or any bigger lens. Luckily for most city photography I use the prime lens so this bag gets the work done.For those looking for a bigger size there is another model by koolertron that claims to fit all the professional DSLR essentials.

$review_text.: I plugged this thing in and instantly could tell it was terrible

One it fit loosely it wasn't tight, but it was not ridiculously loose just loose enough I didn't feel much resistance at all when plugging it in
Second the sound quality was worse than anything I've ever heard, I could not even tell what song was playing it was so bad
I would not recommend this product.

$REVIEW.: The Panasonic DMC-ZS7 and DMC-ZS10 both take excellent still and video photos.  Their picture quality is the best I've experience in a point-n-shoot camera.  However, the GPS functionality is quite frankly poor.  In testing the accuracy ranged from 15 to 185 yards, significantly worse than the 3-5 yards experienced with the Casio EX-H20G, Sony DSC-HX7V, or Nikon P6000.  The buyer needs to ask themselves what is most important, the picture quality or the accuracy of the coordinates.  In a perfect world it would be great to have both in a small point-n-shoot camera, but so far I've yet to find that ideal combination.  If you value still and video image quality then buy the Panasonic DMC-ZS7 or DMC-ZS10.  Both provide excellent picture and video quality.  The other options tested so far provided these results:Nikon P6000 - accurate GPS, fairly quick satellite lock after an initial lock-on in the area, good quality pictures, and mediocre video quality at best.Casio EX-H20G - GPS fairly accurate (within 3-5 meters) and also has a feature when used with the Nikon ViewNX2 program that shows the direction the camera was facing when the photo was taken.Still images:- produces photos taken in sunlight with auto WB that have a pronounced yellowish cast (probably resultig from poor auto WB controls)- non-moving images the focus is good and sharp- moving images are frequently out of focus because of the shutter lag in shooting- tends to over-expose photos 0.3-0.7 f/stops (you can set the exposure offset to compensate for this BUT the setting is lost every time you power down- it appears to not save any of the menu system settings when you turn the camera off)Video- zoom function does not work (digital zoom off) after you've started a recording, before pressing start it does work- quality is OK at minimum zoom settng but not as good as the DMC-ZS7 or DMC-ZS10- using the digital zoom function produced very poor quality videoSony DSC-HX7VStill images:- produces the worst photos of any of the GPS cameras- the white balance is never correct and there is no easy way to correct this in the camera- the sensor has very high contrast and this cannot be adjusted in the camera- the exposure settings choose to grossly overexpose images, even with a manual offset of -1.3 f/stops the pictures still had overexposure issues due to the sensor's high contrastVideo:- the videos are OK at the higher resolution settings though the colors are muted- the zoom function works in the video mode- the camera has a very good macro capability

$REVIEW.: I bought this Bluetooth radio because I didn't have to use the install disk.  Other BT radios I had no choice but to use the install disk, what gets installed is much more complicated and works a lot different then the W7 drivers which my very old BT radio used.  However, I did have to tell W7 to look on the internet for the Broadcom driver for the chip set which it found and installed.  I basically use BT for two things, file transfers and simulated com ports, both of which are supported and work the same as my very old BT radio.  I'm happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: I've used Seagate drives most of my life, starting with a massive Seagate ST-225 20MB drive.I have seen some Seagates die and they've gotten a reputation over the years of not being very reliable. So, when I needed an external drive I initially looked at Western Digital's offerings but they really didn't seem to fit the bill. I took a shot at this Seagate Backup Plus 4TB version. A friend and I met up over the weekend to swap some media files - a couple terabytes worth. Plugged into USB 3.0 ports we were hitting right around 73-75MB/sec. The drive was writing non-stop for probably 4 or 5 hours.The Backup Plus is very quiet, looks good, doesn't seem to get too warm even when transferring data for hours at a time.So far I'm very happy with this purchase.

It programs easily & records well, which is all I really wanted. The remote doesn't do a thing. The total media 3.5 software caused two blue screens while tweaking the recording & radio settings & the cursor disappears on and off, though it seems to work fine with the older total media monitor software. Finally, the wires supplied are cheap and loose fitting. Still gotta try it with windows media center. Has anyone tried it with VLC out there?

$REVIEW.: OK
Deleted the original review


Figured I had the wrong kind of television set


My bad


So I thought I'd try it on my daughter's Sony digital set


I actually got more channels on the analog set than on the digital set

So my initial feeling that this is (COMPLETELY UNPUBLISHABLE SENTENCE HERE, HIDE YOUR EYES) was confirmed.No need to fuss or flail
I'll just pack it back up and return it


And make a note the next time I think about wasting money on something like this


Perhaps this thing functions under different circumstances, but I'm on a hill in San Diego with four broadcast towers not terribly far away and I got NOTHING from this device

Nothing at all!---I must NOT have a TV set of the stripe necessary to use this thing
And a cheap DAC would cost about $40
Plus the $$ for this thing and I'm up around $90, which is about as much as a month's ATT television service, so buying this antenna and the DAC leaves me no better off than just one more month's gouge from ATT to watch the NFL playoffs.Your mileage may vary

I had zero luck with this thing


Why did I bother?

$review_text.: This is the best so far for me. I use this to monitor people approaching my front door, which is about 35 feet away from the camera. I plan on changing the lens to a 12 mm lens, which is still enroute.The camera does a great job in daylight, and a passable job at night. I have it set to send me an email with photos and to upload the photos to my FTP site when there is an alert. It is very cool. I do get a few false alarms, I think it is from the light being switched on or off.Downside: the setup often requires a camera reboot after a change to the configuration.  So, &#34;change a setting, wait a minute for a reboot, log back in, and repeat ten times.&#34;  Also, the alert scheduler could be a little easier to work with... but this is an improvement over the previous Foscam cameras I have.But the picture is good and clear.Warning on setup, if you don't know what an IP DMZ is on a router, this is going to be a difficult setup. I'm just warning you on this. Get your techno-weenie network admin friend to come help you set this up. It will save you from entering a 1 star review.  If you can't assemble a IP network, you will spend  hours trying to figure this out. This was my third camera. It still took me nearly half an hour to set up, and I didn't have to reconfigure anything, I got it right the first time.Still, it works well for me and I would buy another one.

$review_text.: I did a simple test of taking photos as fast as my camera could take them in &#34;continuous&#34; mode. The real benefit of a faster card is more pictures, IMO. For the same amount of time, and the same object being photographed, my Panasonic FZ60 took 25% more photos with this faster memory card.I took off 1 star because I think this is still a little expensive for what it is. A &#34;standard&#34; card can cost half of this card, and I do think this card is nice, but maybe not that nice for twice the cost. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to do....take more pictures in less time.

Also, the touch response is awkward in ways I cannot describe. But I wasn't kidding myself when I set out to buy an Android tablet for far less than any respectable brand would sell it for so I knew what I was in for.If you're like me and you needed this as a non-essential device that you really don't depend on, I would still recommend throwing a few extra dollars in the pot and purchasing an older used tablet than buying this new.

$review_text.: We bought one of these for a Sony Viao desktop that we were moving into the living room and one for a Sony laptop because it's wireless card stopped functioning.  For the desktop, we had a few minor difficulties.  The signal was so low that once I tried removing it from the rear of the PC to put in the front it wouldn't recognize it again.  I had to uninstall the software and re-install to get it to work.  No biggie, and it was a bit glitchy, but once it was set up it worked great.  For the laptop...it has driven my husband to the brink of insanity.  It won't recognize the unit, he tries to uninstall the software and it locks up and then he has to manually go in an find and delete the files.  After no less than 5 tries he still can't get it to work, much less recognize the wireless network that is feet away.  He ended up just giving up and buying CAT wire to plug directly into the modem, which of course defeats the purpose of wireless mobility, but at least he isn't packing his bags for the funny farm!  So one worked great in the end, with some work, and the other didn't work no matter what. I installed the the working one and he wouldn't let me help with his, so maybe it is user error.  So, all in all, if you get it installed and recognized right away, it is a great product.  If you don't it will make you want to smash it with a hammer.  So this may not be the best review, but it is honest.

While it works it only seems to work for a while and then repeatedly the devices attached (iPhone mostly) will tell you the charging device isn't compatible.  It would seem to be an overheating issue of some kind because it works and once it stops working if you leave it unplugged it begins to work again.I bought at the same time a Targus dual ipad/iphone charger and it works much better.In addition to the charging issue, the charger does not fit snuggly into the power receptacle on the car vs. the Targus which fits very well.  Without a snug fit, the charger frequently will vibrate or work its way out and then, before you know it, your phone is nearly dead because it hadn't been charging.Definitely would NOT purchase this over others as even as cheap as it is I found it to be a waste of money.

$REVIEW.: The camera itself works fine, video/picture is good considering the price of the unit, low light video is really terrible, but whats worse is that I can rarely get anything off it because its like a game of tug of war every time I plug this thing into my computer. Sometimes it will work and i can xfer files from it and sometimes it wont. Right now, as I write this, it is not working or allowing me to xfer anything from it.The moment I plug it in, I cant even open My Computer or any other apps, the computer just does not respond. Great if I want to sit here and spin the mouse pointer around on my screen all night. The moment I unplug the usb, BAM! everything I clicked on flies open on the screen.This product is so hit & miss, its not even funny. Fortunately I haven't had any problems with the broken ports others have reported (and I've been rough with it out of extreme frustration.)Its too bad I'm out of the return period for Amazon, the camera worked ok most of the time so I figured it was a problem with my computer, but after some of the other viewers having similar issues with the camera & arcsoft (mine locks the desktop whether or not arcsoft is installed. When it did work, I had no problem with arcsoft.) And the problem has intensified to the point of it simply being useless for anything other than recording & viewing ON the camera itself or on a tv. Xfering files to a computer via the camera is out of the question. I will have to buy a card reader now just to extract the files because this camera (at least the one I got) doesn't function the way it should.I would give this camera 4 stars if it functioned as advertised, but due to the incredibly frustrating nature of the problem I'm experiencing with it, its a one star.
$review_summary.: Camera itself works great, if only it wouldn't freeze my computer everytime I plug it in.

$REVIEW.: I own several high end cans and infinitely prefer over-the-ear muffs over in ear buds..
Or I did until I received the Brainwavz S1.Everything is high end, from the over the ear design to the comfort to the supplied tips
There's even an airplane adapter which is a sweet addition.But aside from the aesthetics the most impressive thing for me is the sound
Deep bass and high range pours into your ears, highlighting stereo separation and just sound amazing
Several times I popped one of them out of my ear because I felt like the sound was surrounding me rather than being forced through such tiny plugs
I defy anyone to listen to that &#34;haircut simulator&#34; audio and not be amazed.Every genre of music I've tried sounds incredible and these make the supplied earphones by Apple sound like fisher price amateur hour
Speaking of which, there's no mic or controls, so keep that in mind

But honestly, you won't be reaching for your apple buds any time soon after buying these

He was worried about having to add another phone line in the house and I told him not to worry...there's an easier way. Plug it into the wall outlet, plug in the phone line, same procedure in another room and you're all set. I was a bit worried because they live in an older mobile home but it worked A-OK. I would suggest this for anyone needing another phone line in another room.

Not the prettiest installation but would work in a pinch.

 My only complaints are very minor

First, if the hard drive will only hold 298GB, I wish Iomega would just be honest and say it holds 298GB instead of saying 320GB


 Second, it comes formatted in FAT32

$review_text.: This Airplay speaker by Klipsch offers one of the better sounds from a smaller stand-alone wireless speaker
So far the B&W; airplay models (Zeppelin, Z2, A5, A7) are the only speakers that may have a slightly better sound
But we are talking about a serious difference is price


The G-17 is being closed out at great prices


Anything under $200 is good, $150 is very good and $100 is outstanding.Pros:Solid construction, well built w/ 5 yr warrantyHigh quality highs and mid-range.Decent punchy base for such a small speaker


Will not replace a true stereo setup, but very respectable and not boomy at all.Airplay connection provides higher quality sound than today's standard Bluetooth connection which has significant compression resulting in loss of quality.Cons:Takes some time to hook up, but the app has improved and seems to work quite well nowSlight delay in playing music before it connects802.11 b/g only (no N) - only limits you if you have a less featured router that does not allow for maximum speed on mixed devices.Cannot connect to more than one at a time.Not sure what to do with that "white glove" now!

$review_text.: I wouldn't have chosen the color, but the product seems to be of adequate quality. If you didnt know better, you might think that it was actually low grade leather.The fit on the Ipad2 casing is good. Its tight, at first I thought that it didn't quite fit(as another reviewer stated). However, I used just a little more pressure and the final corner snapped in, and the back case was snug and firmly attached.My only gripe is the front cover. It covers well, it folds up and acts as a stand, all of that. I cant speak to how durable it is yet, but it appears to be well made. However, the magnets that hold it on are a little bit on the weak side, just a little bit less than the OEM smart covers. How often will you be holding it upside down, while carefully holding only the edge, to have the magnets not quite hold and the cover flip open? Probably never unless you are a nitpicky person like myself.

It's all automatic, and any creative control must be programmed by menus. The lens is not even threaded for filters so you can't even use a basic UV lens protector. Considering all that it doesn't do, this camera is a bulky pocket rock, and those for whom it was designed would be better off with a compact point & shoot.

$REVIEW.: AmazonBasics has created a small bag that's just right for my Nikon fixed lens mini-camera.  The bag includes three zippered pockets, two exterior pockets, one interior.  The interior of the bag is lined with flannel to minimize scratches, and there is a stretchable panel that holds my camera securely.  The exterior of the bag is nylon. A shoulder strap is included with the bag, or you can carry it by the permanent nylon handle on top of the bag.The best part of the bag for me is the roomy interior.  I've got plenty of room to store my battery recharger without cramming it into the camera (now protected by the flannel panel).  Store extra batteries, extra memory cards, lens cleaner, and I've still got room left.Overall, a terrific little bag that I highly recommend for your little camera.

$review_text.: I've owned this set for a while now

Got it after rave reviews from several sites
Panasonic seemed to have had issues with some TV sizes and batch dates


THX was off
The screen had a greenish cast


Panasonic did fix this with firmware updates

But before that, there was a lot of internet chatter and many owners were pissed
Some of us (myself incld) calibrated the set and it looked good after that
These were calibration offsets that were not correctly set at the factory

Had they been color decoding issues behind it, we would not be able to fix it till Panny fixed that in the firmware.The set worked great for the first 1000 hrs

Then, the infamous black level hit

Google it and find out for yourself.I'm not sure if the 2011 line up has Kuro tech and/or some other tech that will not ramp the initialization voltage like it does for this set

Doing that increases the MLL (min luminance) and affects your (real) contrast as perceived by the eye.Panny came out with some stupid infinite black nonsense
This only worked in vivid mode and if no pixel was being addressed


Only then would the entire screen turn off.The plus with Panny is they build very reliable products that do not fail (stop working)
The newer sets seem pretty good


However, unless there are enough data points with actual consumer usage, I'd be wary of initial reviews


Many of us who got the 50" got burned

I think the 54" and larger sizes seemed to exhibit less of the black level issue.

$review_text.: The ADVC110 from Canopus is a great little device that lets you import all your old analog video into your computer.Once you connect this device to your computer via the FireWire cable it is seen as a standard FireWire device and is treated just as if you had connected your modern camcorder to the computer


Within your video editing program you capture video just as you would normally, except that instead of the capture program being able to control playback you will need to manually start the playback on your source device (VHS VCR, 8mm camcorder, etc.).Connecting the unit is easy
Simply plug your analog source into the standard RCA ports (or use optional S-video for the video portion) and then connect the fireWire cable between the device and your computer

Optionally you can connect things in reverse and use the FireWire as the source with the converter changing your digital video into analog (I guess if you want to output your digital video to an older TV)

I have not used the device this way.My main use for the ADVC110 is to import lots of old VHS and 8mm tapes that I had recorded throughout the years into my computer

From there I am simply archiving the video files to external hard drives
This is great because now I can easily review tons of records straight from my computer with instant access instead of searching for tapes, rewinding them, etc

The video files are standard DV format and take up about 13GB of disk space per hour.So far I have imported about 100 hours of video with this device and it has worked flawlessly!There are two things that the ADVC110 did not come with that I had to purchase separately: An AC power adapter and a 4-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable


This may not apply to you if you are using a Mac computer or a desktop Windows computer, but for my Lenovo laptop they were required


Why? Since my laptop only has a 4-pin FireWire port I had to buy the 4-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable (Canopus includes other cables in the box, but not this particular one)


The problem is that 4-pin FireWire cables do not provide power to the device, so you then need to connect an AC power adapter to the ADVC110 in order for it to turn on


Once you have this setup and working everything is fine, but you should be aware that you need these two extra items if you will be using a 4-pin FireWire port

Also be advised that the AC adapter is quite expensive for what it is (search Amazon to see).All in all this is a fantastic device if you are serious about capturing high quality video from analog sources.

$REVIEW.: I was initially thrilled to get the wireless keyboard and mouse at the great price, although I bought it because the mouse fits better than other big ones on my hand. However, after using for three months, I had to give up using the mouse, as the mouse seem to roam freely on its own will. I mean the mouse cursor on the screen. I guess, it is due to noise from all the other wireless device near my computer desk - couple of 2.4 GHz phones, wireless router, bluetooth headphones and transmitter, and probably the huge speaker on which this mouse transmitter sits (and the fluroscent lamps, VCR, printers and what not). I am not sure of noise problem on the keyboard, as I do not type that much, but I do graphics with the mouse, and it is a pain to point at anything accurately - it will move slightly at the last moment on its own. So today I had to switch to the old wired $5 mouse back.Also, my wife uses the keyboard much, and she immeditely noticed that the letters on the keys are printed very small, and like us, if you are used to type while looking at the keys (not a touch typist), it is a strain to look at the much smaller letters - about half the size of letters on standard Dell or Gateway keyboard, which I had earlier. Also the key clusters on right have changed as noted by another reviewer, but I can live with it. Since I switched to wired mouse, I guess I will switch back to my earlier wired keyboard which came with my desktop, and put this wirelses set on sale on crigslist or ebay.

$REVIEW.: As always, Noctua makes the very best fan out there. Top-notch build quality, the best airflow:noise ratio anywhere, and plenty of adapters to make the fan quieter if you wish.Best of all, you get a 6 year warranty... I guarantee you that no other fan is going to last you 6 years. Believe me, I've tried for a long time to find a fan that will reliably last 6 years so that I didn't have to put brown fans in my rig. They aren't out there. If you want a long lasting, top-notch fan, you need to buy these.The only con, as always with Noctua's stuff, is that brown fans go with pretty much no build aesthetic. If you can hide these away or don't have a case window, it's no big deal, but for windowed cases this might be a deal breaker for some. I hid two away in the roof of my Storm Trooper and I can deal with the one slightly exposed on the rear exhaust.The 6 year warranty is why you should buy these IMO... I got tired of having to replace rattling fans every year or two.
$SUMMARY.: The best 140mm fan out there

$REVIEW.: I've driven through 11 states with this in 7k miles over the last couple months and it's only sent me in a circle once.  That may sound silly but for any GPS that I've ever used that's actually quite remarkable.  The display is clear and bright.  When there are multiple lanes it shows you where you to position yourself which is awesome when driving through a place like Atlanta if you're not familiar with 5 or 8 lanes of traffic.  Garmin gives you fun freebie downloads of voices and cars too which is nice.  The lifetime maps is sweet because we all know how there's always some road construction going on and you don't want to get lost like I did with another brand a couple years ago because the on ramp moved :-)  It's features are standard for GPSs so nothing will be making you a cup of coffee when you turn it on but it's accuracy is what impressed me and has now made me a Garmin fan for life.

$review_text.: I wanted a little boombox-type thing to take my ipod to the beach with my firends
 I didn't want to carry a giant ghetto blaster


 I usually don't spend alot on stero equipment, and I am usually unhappy with what I buy


 The price of this unit wasn't crazy, so I took a chance on this one


Man, it is great

 I couldn't believe that it sounded like a big stereo and looked like a transistor radio (well..a little bigger.)  Now, the beach isn't quiet, and people were strolling by and asking each other "where is that music coming from?"Also, many of the ipod boomboxes don't let you navigate the ipod menu when you insert them
This one attaches with the included plug/wire, so your ipod is tethered, not inserted, therefore accessible

 No batteries to worry about either, as you simply recharge it

 I recharged mine overnight and never ran out of juice over the course of an 6-7 hour constant play.I did buy the ipal carrying case offered on amazon


 I used the strap on the carrying case to hang the tivoli right on the ribs of the beach umbrella!  Then I just put my ipod in a ziploc bag, left the zipper open just enough for the plug for the tivoli to fit through, and could click around from my chair!! Don't laugh about the ziploc!! I know it isn't fancy, but I could see through it, use the click wheel through it, and keep out the sand/mist...all for the price of about 1 cent!The tivoli now sits unobtrusively in my kitchen where I alternate radio and ipod
I couldn't tell if the colored radios come with the ipod input jack or not, so I just ordered the white one...I would have preferred another color, but I still completely love it.

$REVIEW.: The box claims you can connect in three easy steps.  Unfortunately, this was far from the case for me.  After hours of trying to install the software, updating the firmware, downloading the app on my iPhone, I can sometimes see my child on my computer and can sporadically see him on my iPhone.  The connection isn't very reliable (I have consistently reliable wireless internet access, so my WIFI does not explain why I can sometimes see a live view of my child and sometimes see a black screen).While this system may be more secure than your standard baby monitor, it's not worth the hassle and it's a bit inconvenient (the iPhone app is worthless and I'm not going to carry my computer throughout the house).Needs more work!

$REVIEW.: I now have three of the 131 wirelesses. Read the specs...its resolution and fixed focus is as described. If these are sufficient for your application, it is a great camera, but do not expect sharp long range vistas taken through your window. That takes $600 to $1000+ camera. For this camera, think 5 to 50 feet range with images twice as good as a standard USB webcam but only half as good as a decent standard definition camcorder.One thing I don't now why is so hidden in the documentation, is what MAC addresseS to set in your router if you use MAC filtering for security. You need to enter TWO (2) MAC addresses in your router. 1st the one labelled on the camera and that appears on the Easy Setup screen plus many other places AND  after you have connected to the camera the 2nd one hidden under the MAINTENANCE tab WIRELESS STATUS side tab, the BSSID address must also be entered in you router's allowed MAC address list. This is either the next letter or number (varies) in the last (12th position) from the main MAC address. Example: If main MAC is 00:90:F0:B7:1H:3C then 2nd is 00:90:F0:B7:1H:3D or if 00:90:F0:B7:1H:37 then 00:90:F0:B7:1H:38.Internet viewing and control works perfectly on both my wife's and my 3GS iPhones. But, it is very slow if your connection is Edge rather than 3G or wifi.The web interface is fine for locally or remotely viewing and controlling a camera. It is very weak for surviellence and recording use. And the Panasonic software for this purpose is absurdly expensive for what it does. Search online and you will find something that will fit you needs for $35 to $100. I use and like Active WebCam Deluxe from PY Software at $89.
$SUMMARY.: Great Cam, but watch MAC Filtering Setup

With it's micro size and it's decent resolution, I am very happy with my purchase


 The Veho Muvi micro cam is about the size of your thumb and comes with a clip that can swivel to attach virtually anywhere
 The quality of video is not HD quality, but for the size and price of the camera, the quality is still great


 I highly recommend this camera if you want an inexpensive micro video camera that could be attached to your dashboard, handlebars, clothes, radio controlled toys, pets, etc.

$REVIEW.: My 80GB drive disappeared from my system.  Don't know whether it was the cable, the bios settings, or the jumper settings, but once I replaced the old IDE cable with this one, made the drive master, and set the BIOS to both primary and secondary IDE, I now see the drive in My computer.  System eventually froze when trying to access the drive, but I did a Check drive and used the 2 fix options available and it seems to be working OK.  It still will not recognize the drive for booting, but it may be because I have another controller involved.  Someday, I might have to get it booting by disabling or removing the controller.  Cable seems to be working fine.  I bought 2 of these and am still waiting to employ the second.

$REVIEW.: I really like this router. It's easy to set up and get working. It also has a ton of options that let you control everything you would ever need to. You can have both a wireless G network for your older devices as well as a wireless N network for your newer faster devices. Both at the same time! When I switched to this router I noticed right away that web pages came up faster on my wired computers. Both the wireless G and N worked fine in our house.For wireless N connectivity on our notebook we use theRangeMax WNDA3100 Dual Band Wireless-N Adapter. For greater coverage we also addedNETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111). The notebook gets great speeds a floor away from the access point. I am very happy with the performance of all the router features.Cool Features:- The Web interface is easy to use covers everything I need to do.- Allows the router to email you the logs on a user specified schedule.- Firmware is easy to update and the router will check if there is an update available.- It is easy to find the grid of attached devices along with all the stats for each connected device.- IP reservation is easy since it allows you to pick the device from the list. No more typing in MAC addresses.- Security for wireless also allows you to just pick the device from the list of attached devices and add it to the allowed devices. On other routers you have to type in MAC addresses.Items to note:- It is not a 1 gigabit router. But you can easily plug it into a 1 gig switch and then plug all your 1 gig devices into that switch.- The large blue light on the top cannot be shut off. It will light up a fairly large area in the dark. It's cool looking though.

$REVIEW.: I bought the H70 (with no fans, I used my own) off of Newegg with a $20 rebate, and it was a very good purchase in my opinion, although I didn't really see a good improvement until After I added a second fan. My case is very small for a gaming case, and I can only fit one fan on the cooler before it gets in the way of my RAM. I dealt with this, and I noticed that my CPU (i7 OC'd to 4GHz) was getting to 80C at 100% load (which is better than my old cooler, which got the CPU up to 85-90C.)I dealt with it like that until I saw a picture on the internet that gave me a 'derp' moment: they put a fan on the outside of the case, and one on the inside. So I did just that: fan outside, then case, then the cooler, then another fan, to make the recommended push-pull dynamic. Now with two fans, my cpu never gets above 70C, which is a HUGE improvement!If you get this cooler, MAKE SURE TO USE TWO FANS!
$SUMMARY.: [H70] Really needs both fans.

$REVIEW.: You should read the more in-depth reviews first, but I just wanted to add my voice and say that this is a really nice camera.If you are on the cusp of getting an SLR but not quite sure you want to delve into it (as I was), this is a good choice.I really like most aspects of it and don't have any major complaints.  Getting it to focus properly in the environments I used it in (I was photographing performers at music events) was pretty frustrating at times, but once I got to know it well enough it was better.  The built-in flash is fairly useless for low light settings where the subject is more than a few feet away.  Also a problem with the built-in flash if you plan on using it: if you have the Lens Hood attached, there will be a shadow along the bottom of your photos because the built-in flash does not project far enough over it.I also got this for the video capability but was very annoyed by the sound recording.  In loud environments, even on the lowest input-volume setting, it will record with lots of distortion.  I didn't understand this because friends of mine have older and lower-model PowerShots and in the same environments they could record without distortion.  You'd think this would be possible on the better model, but apparently not.Other than that, a very solid product all around.

$REVIEW.: I bought this unit refurbished from Essex Technology Group. This is the second purchase that I have made through them. The first one was for a UV sterilizer for a reef aquarium (it ended up being faulty and shorting out). Anyhow I thought that it would be pretty reasonable to this company a second chance. Needless to say there won't be a third! This refurbished unit arrived in a box, inside there was some brown paper, and inside a dirty clear bag with a twist tie was the docking station. I cleaned the animal hair off of it, as well as other debris and smudges. After doing this I noticed that the front screen cover (where the clock display is) was off center, it was actually broken off and sticking on the adhesive crooked. I removed it, cleaned it up, and reattached. After all of this I plugged the unit in, and there is absolutely NO SOUND, NO BUTTON FUNCTION, and the remote battery was dead! I should have expected that after seeing the condition of the piece. It's a nice sized unit; I will reorder it through someone else and update this review regarding sound quality etc. AVOID ESSEX TECHNOLOGY GROUP!!

$REVIEW.: After reading a lot of reviews, some of which criticized Samsung's DLP technology for internal reflections (IR) and/or other black/color problems, it was with trepidation that I bought the 43&quot; model (HLN4365W) and married it to Samsung's new DVD player (DVD-HD931) which has a DVI output


 After almost a month of use, I can say the concerns are not an issue
 I made some minor adjustments to video intensity, contrast, etc., and find the picture absolutely outstanding
 Call me an unsophisticated viewer, but really I can find no flaws to mention, let alone to rant about


 This applies to DVD playback in DVI mode.Normal analog TV (cable) is only slightly better than my old TV, which just says that DLP cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear

 I will be converting to HDTV cable soon.For both TV signals and DVD, full use of the DLP screen is not assurred

 This is not the fault of the TV or DVD player but the many formats present in various media
 One can stretch or distort the picture to fill more/all of the screen but I generally found it better to leave the aspect ratio for correct proportion and live with black bars
 DVD's such as Finding Nemo or Iceage fill the screen with crisp, dazzling color while natural content like Winged Migration awe the viewer with subtle colors and overwhelming detail

 I don't see how video can get any better than this.So, my opinion is stop your worring and dive in


 The combo above has met my high expectations and will, no doubt, impress you as well.

The case fan that came with the box is louder than the power supply even though the case fan is pretty quiet too.

Add to the fact that the connector is more robust as well and this cable has met every expectation that I had for it.I have owned this cable for about a month and it has outperformed the original and is still working well.The durability of this cable is important because this Nexus7 belongs to my 6 year-old son and he isn't necessarily the gentlest with it.I have been very happy with every cable that I have purchased from Medibridge.  They have all been well constructed and are priced very reasonably.

They are amazing for 10ish bucks shipped.  The band is a bit uncomfortable around the ears but they stay put and I like the wire is on only one side.  It makes it easier to wear during lifting.

$REVIEW.: -----------------------------------------Updated on May 20:This one went dead very soon. I used it while jogging, that's it and it's dead now. I sweat a lot so that could be the reason....so guys who sweat while jogging dont buy this...I will update on the customer service later..-----------------------------------------I did enough research and finally decided to go for this. I like it very much; this review is based on the usage for 2 weeks so far. I will try to post updates if I find anything good or bad about this in the future.I am enjoying this player so far. I use it everyday in the gym. I do jogging and it is really apt for me (Thanks to the armband). The sound effect is really cool. The ear phones are great and never fall out of my ears while jogging. It comes with 3 different sizes of ear buds so I hope it can fit in all ear. The navigations are simple and easy. The sound control wheel is bit let down but I don't find it annoying at all. The expandable memory slot is really helpful for me as I already have a 1 GB SD card from my PDA. One problem with this player is if you switch off the player and switch it on, it plays from the beginning of the last track played (It's not smart enough to bookmark the exact spot on the track) So if you are listening any audio stories, you may have to fast forward every time you reset the player.Overall, I am completely satisfied with the player so far! I would recommend this!

$review_text.: This little guy came with a package insert that told me to use it on almost anything electronic that has a screen. It also said that some pressure needed to be exerted to make it work well. Because I have many, many grungy screens on my electronic items, I decided to go on a cleaning binge and let you know how it worked:Kindle Tablet: Removed all the dust and fingerprints in a few swipes, all without water or cleanser. A+iPad: Nearly as good as the Kindle, but didn't remove all the fingerprints and left some littledots on the screen (maybe someone sneezed?) A-Laptop: Screen needed support from behind to use the eraser with the required pressure. Like theiPad, the Screen Cleaner did not remove all the fingerprints and smears. Cleaned dustperfectly, though. A-Printer: (has a touchscreen) Removed everything, including smears and fingerprints. A+Flat Screen TV: Could not support the back of the television enough to use the eraser. Lighter strokeswhich prevented the screen from bending, removed surface dust but that was all. COlder Style TV: Did not need support, so I could use as much pressure as I wanted with the eraser.Removed dust, some fingerprints and smears. B-Summary: the Screen Cleaner worked perfectly on dry dust, especially if you could press the eraserinto the surface you were cleaning. It had trouble on items that could only handle a lightwipe (the Flat Screen TV and Laptop) and on any oil-based fingerprint or smear (mostfingerprints leave behind a small amount of oil) I have found that a wet electronicscleaning wipe removes these oils and does a far better job cleaning surfaces that areroutinely touched. Works well for a quick dusting, and would be perfect packed in the caseof an iPad, Kindle or other tablet. These items can be supported easily, so one can use thepressure necessary to clean the surface.Two other good things to know: twenty-five cents from the sale of each Screen Cleaner goes to a worthy charity. My eraser was black, which means the money went to a Wounded Veterans Charity. Secondly, these are manufactured in the USA, providing increasingly scarce manufacturing jobs.
$review_summary.: Great for tablets and laptops, not so much for the tv.

$review_text.: I've had a lot of iPods and lots of skins and cases form them, and this is among my favorites

 It fits fine and looks great
 The material also helps keep it from sliding around
 I also LOVE that it covers the screen


 So many cases and skins don't, so you have to buy a separate screen cover if you are so inclined


 My only complaint, which isn't big, is that sometimes it's hard to see the screen because of the cover, but that's true any time you use a cover


 If you want rugged protection, obviously you need more than a skin
 But for regular daily use, this works fine for me and it's the only skin I use.

$REVIEW.: I purchased a pair of Klipsch earbud headphones on the advice of a salesman in an electronics store. The Klipsch  sound quality is very dependent on the seal in your ear. If you have them inserted fully, the sound quality is very good.I bought them to use with my Ipod touch while jogging. The Klipsch earbuds require constant repositionining while jogging to maintain the fidelity. My Ipod touch (32 gb) was not compatible with the push button controls. I also noticed some background noise (bumping) from the wire movement while jogging. After 3 weeks of daily use (about 1 hour daily), the left speaker quit.I returned them and purchased Bose IE2 earbuds for the same price. IMO, the Bose are a far superior product. The earbuds are designed to remain solidly and comfortably in place. The buds are designed to form fit the ear ridge and do not have to be fully pushed in the ear like the Klipsch. The audio quality outperforms the Klipsch as well.

$review_text.: Love the device -- really works, easy to fix (when the time comes) and inexpensive.  Only problem is the angle; it's fine for a desk, but it tips the laptop farther up in back, which makes for an uncomfortable sight angle when held in the -- well -- lap.  Designers needed to treat a laptop as a LAPtop and not a DESKtop.  I might glue a strip of wood under the lower edge to compensate.  Couldn't hurt it.

I bought it as a screen extension to my DJ laptop to allow me to monitor Traktor2 from it as I don't like the smaller screen that comes with any laptop.It is certainly apparent from taking it out from the box that it is not the most expensive monitor but asthetics asides it performs well enough and gets the job done. Its screen is bright and clear , looks good in native and has a good refresh rate for those of you who may use it to play games or watch video's.I am well pleased with this buy and more so considering the price I got it for.....you would not be able to buy a used 20 inch monitor of this quality for the price I paid. Well done Amazon, I bought a few things on the sale week and none have disappointed....apart from the ones I was too late to buy!The five starts have been given not for overall performance, but for the overall performance at the price.

$review_text.: I just recently got my first Mac (Air), and I wanted a keyboard with a 10-key panel. Having a long history of success with Logitech products, I went straight to Amazon and searched for &#34;Logitech keyboard mac&#34; and after browsing results I went with this one. I ran into one correctable problem and one nuisance that I'll simply have to live with...Pros:-All of the keys work perfectly, and the layout is great for someone who's used to using Windows.-No battery-changing to worry about-Little flip-down legs let you tilt the rear up at an angle-Quiet buttons-Setup takes five seconds*Cons:-The surface (other than the keys) is glossy/shiny and displays fingerprints and dust magnificently. I'm guessing they went with this to avoid having to use two different surface materials (the solar panels are necessarily transparent).-The surface is _also_ very &#34;soft,&#34; and wiping dust off with the included microfiber cloth resulted in scuff/scratch marks... from the cloth, not the dust.-The Fn key is in an odd place IF you're used to the placement on a regular Mac keyboard--I personally like it this way.-Construction seems a but cheap--there is a bulge at the top to the left of the Logitech logo; because of the shiny surface, this sticks out like a sore thumb.*The function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) on a Mac are, by default, used for things like screen brightness, sound volume, and playback controls. To use them as function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) you have to hold down the Fn key. OSX offers an option to switch this behavior so that the function keys are function keys, and to use the other system controls (volume, brightness, etc.) you have to hold down the Fn key. As one accustomed to Windows, I turned this option on. Unfortunately, the Logitech solar keyboard does not honor this setting, and you are left with the default behavior regardless of what you set in System Preferences. Logitech's website has a Control Center program available that remedies this--and only this. Since the program does nothing else specific to this product, I can only conclude that this was an afterthought bugfix. While it's not a huge deal, I do like to install as few extra little programs as possible.Overall, I like the keyboard. It's comfortable and works well, but I think it could have been executed a lot better. If Logitech were to release a version with a matte surface, I would sell this thing and buy the new one in a heartbeat. The Fn key issue is minor and fixable. I have a great distaste, however, for glossy devices (especially in black), and the fact that I have scuffmarks after two days of ownership really does irritate me.

$REVIEW.: April 2013.  I have had the card for about 4 months and seemed to work fine.  I use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small (only 128GB).  About a month ago, the card could not be recognized.  It only lasted about 2 hours, so I thought maybe just a momentary blip.  However, this weekened, it cannot be recognized at all and it has been 3 days.  Sandisk support is not available until the week, so I will update on tech support soon.  However, I did find that the SanDisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards.  I assume they will replace it, but I have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures... so I am really bummed and frustrated.From SanDisk: "SanDisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its 32GB and 64GB SanDisk Mobile Ultra microSD cards. Under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible. The issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place. SanDisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microSD cards cards is asked to contact the SanDisk support center for a resolution immediately." SanDisk

$review_text.: Bought this model after our sony kdl46s4100 went kaput within 4 days.  40" is smaller than a 46", but not by much.  It has built-in features such as CineSpeed and DynoLight, which are supposed to make your movie viewing experience close to that in a cinema; but frankly, I don't really know how much better these features have made a regular DVD any better than they already are (sorry, not bluRay yet).The TV tuner seems to be better than that of the Sony we had.  We use a rabbit ear antenna with enhancement features, and this set has picked up three extra channels than the Sony did - albeit these additional channels are all religious channels that we don't really care for.While HD signals are played beautifully, SD signals suffer from quite severe ghosting - that is, murky color spots would appear to be "fixed" at certain spots on the screen while the rest of the scene move. It may also have something to do with how SD images are rendered because we don't notice this problem with HD signals.Not sure how much output power the speakers have.  We only use the built-in speakers for TV and Wii; as for DVDs, we pipe the sound to a 5.1 with fiber optics.  The mute button is a two-step mute. That is, the first click cuts the volume by half, and the second click completely silences it.  nice or annoying, you be the judge.CNet review says this TV is not "digital TV certified" and I am not quite sure what they mean by that.The picture size features are badly named. While "native", "full" and "4:3" make sense, we have no idea what "Theatre 1", "Theatre 2", "Theatre 3" and "Natural" actually mean.  Just different types of zoom modes, I guess.What bothered me the most is how its PC (or VGA) port only displays up to 1050x768. If you want to get 1080p for your computer, you must get a DVI/HDMI cable (I got a 10' cable from monoprice dot com for about 18 bucks).  However, the default picture setting has over-set the saturation, so the green and red look as if they are going to melt the screen and burn my eyes out.  I had to lower the color setting to lower the saturation.  But quite frankly, 1080p is bit too small on the fonts (I know I can change the DPI, but I don't want to), so I reverted back to 1050x768 (shhhh... don't let my wife know that or she will yell at me for buying that DVI/HDMI cable for nothing).The remote control comes with the set is a universal remote and it looks fancy... but a lot of buttons are useless until you program it to replace all your other remotes... the buttons are not back-lit, but are actually glow-in-the-dark, so they are still difficult to use in the dark.  Personally I prefer a simple remote with few buttonsIts power saving (and screen saving) feature is not as good as I hoped.  The TV does not turn off its back light quickly when there is no video signal; instead, it displays a jumping blue banner that says no signal detected, and I have not found out how long it takes to automatically shut off (or on standby).Overall I am very satisfied with this unit, and it is definitely worth the price.

$REVIEW.: Well, after long wait and search since last year and price up and down, finally pulled trigger on this S-550


 The best decision to complete my home theater system

 I am shocked at Panny BD35 and BD55 price hike/ fluctuation and scarcity, but the Sony S-550 will get  what you need

 At $284 bought this month with Amazon, while the Panasonics are selling at sky-limit price, I am a very satisfied and happy camper here.The Sony s-550 is very very easy to set up, in fact 10 min, provided you have your wireless router with ethernet cable ready for internet connection, your HDMI cable ready from your 7.1 HDMI receiver (Onkyo 606)
 The unit will start once powered up to let you walk through set-up with extremely easy like baby step


The player runs quiet and smooth with stunning quality, in all, it plays very well as what you expected from Sony players.The picture/video and audio from this baby is amazing, blu-ray is truly entertaining and addictive !  Very happy and highly recommend this S-550.I know as long as Panny are in short supply  till the new BD 60 and 80 come out, this  sony S-550 will be in high demand and of coures, price hike will follow as soon as it is getting scarce!  Get this before it is out of control again
 BTW, software update is a breeze, make sure you have your internet connection ready.

$REVIEW.: First off, unless you have the noise cancelling mode on, the sound is absolutely horrible--VERY tinny/puny sound as someone else noted.  This is a big showstoper for me since I don't always need the NC on.Secondly, these headphones will cause you pain after just a couple of hours, probably because the pading is flush with the middle part of the headphone.  Ouch, they really do hurt.Lastly, and this probably is a problem with other noise cancelling phones, your blackberry will drive these phones absolutley crazy--nonstop buzzing.  Anyone that has a blackberry and has had their phone too close to cheap speakers will know exactly what I'm talking about.  Beware of this problem.  Since you really have to have NC on all the time for these headphones to sound decent, the buzzing may drive you bonkers.Oh well, at least they're inexpensive.

$review_text.: I like the design of this Acoustic Research AS6 Swivel style surge protector. It seems to be built quite sturdy and the way that it can swivel open is pretty convenient. I'm currently using it on a wall plug that is directly under my kitchen bar, and the fact that it swivels open makes it more easily accessible to both sides of the bar since the wall plug is located in the center wall near a corner that converges the two ends of the bar. It's been working without a hitch since I've plugged it in, and I've been using it to power my two laptops and some external hard drives... very critically important devices.As with most products, not all aspects of it's design are perfect. The only criticism that I have is that when you plug it into the wall plug, it actually blocks the top wall plug as well. I think a better design would have allowed this surge protector to only use up the bottom plug. Also, it would've been very nice to have standard USB ports built into this unit as well... since so many modern devices use USB ports for power. I know that this isn't an advertised feature of this surge protector, so I didn't take away any stars for it. I'm just saying that it would've made it an even better product if it had included some USB ports as well.Overall, this seems to be an excellent product and I would recommend this to anyone who is currently looking at buying a swivel style Surge Protector.

$review_text.: I am not very satisfied from this product. It does what it says, that is true, but there are major drawbacks which undermine its real usability. First of all, if you have a PS3, this item is completely useless. The reason for that is you can stream video content to your PS3 and hence to your television and the quality is much much better. The video quality is a major concern here: even using their dedicated video player, unless you have a 720p high quality video, the output will be mediocre (at least on a 55', using HDMI connection). I tried several H.264 videos (640x360) and there is an incredible degrading in output quality if compared to the direct streaming to PS3 using a media server (but you can always just plug an external USB hard-drive to the PS3 if you don't want to stream). Only with 720p video, the difference is not very noticeable. Audio, on the other side, is great, and there is no audible difference between the player and PS3 streaming. Another disappointing issue is that even if you can stream your desktop content, the CPU utilization is unacceptable, roughly 70% on both my P3750@2GHz cores. This might be a less annoying problem if you have a very fast machine, but still I would have expected less usage. If you plan to use your television as a second monitor, forget about it: as explained in the manual, there is a 2-3 seconds delay and also your mouse pointer is not shown on the television. The real use I do of this is to stream internet videos directly to my television. To conclude this is useful in my opinion ONLY if you have high quality videos and you don't have a PS3 attached to your television or you just want to stream internet content.

$review_text.: I bought a &#34;Like New&#34; unit from warehouse deals, so I might have received a lemon, but I had some quality issues with mine.  There are multiple levels on the head, but at least on the one I got, none of the levels agreed with each other, nor did they actually indicate true level (compared with a separate spirit level).  Whoever glued the bubble levels onto mine must have been asleep or drunk.  I also found that one of the legs was longer than the other 2; I don't know how this could happen, perhaps something to do with the assembly of the legs.For what you pay for this tripod & head, you get a lot of nice features.  There's a lot of metal used in the construction of both the legs and head, so it feels substantial, but the quality of the metal and overall feel is a notch below brand names - it lacks the fine finish you find on most photographic equipment.  It feels more like something you'd buy at Harbor Freight Tools, if you're familiar with that store.  Some parts are designed well, others not - for example, the legs hit up against the center tube when folded up, and will eventually leave scrape marks.  Obviously the manufacturer realized this, as they ship it with some bubble wrap around the center tube to prevent scratches during shipping.I think you might like it for about $95; you'd be hard pressed to find a comparable tripod at this price.  But I wanted something that was a little better quality.

It is easy to follow when just listening to the voice prompts and dings.  It makes a unique ding for left or right turns.  I recommend this one.With newest cell technology I see no need for gps any longer. If you want/need. Then this IS the best.

$REVIEW.: This is a great product for those on the road. All the LaCie rugged drives are very durable and can withstand serious handling on the road. The older drives have mixed USB, FireWire (400 and 800). This is a pure USB 3.0 drives. The speed of the new interface is significantly faster than the old one. I use the drive for backup and "off-line" files. In sch situations you prefer as much speed as you can get. Finally I am getting a pretty good solution. This is a really nice product. The accompanying software is "nice" but it is not the best possible package for a road worrier.It is slow and has a mediocre interface. However the hardware is fantastic.

$REVIEW.: Have to update my review. Initially gave this case 5 stars as its an affordable price, looks great and provides excellent protection. But less than a month after receiving it, part of the plastic has already broken off and now comes loose anytime I touch the power button. While poetic does indeed provide 3 year coverage, they neglect to mention that the consumer is responsible for shipping the case back. The case cost $9.95, it is not economically feasible to pay $7 to ship this back when I can just buy another case from a better manufacturer. Do not recommend this case.

$REVIEW.: I did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera.  I actually purchased two of them, one for my wife and one for myself.  My main uses are landscape, macro, and candid-street photography.  My wife focuses mostly on birds, so our needs are quite different in dslr's.  Because this is a DSLT (digital single lens translucent), and the mirror doesn't have to move to take the shot, it gives a full 10 FPS and works wonders for photographing birds and wildlife.I have found the quality of the photos to be excellent, even to 1600 ISO.  I see some noise at 3200 but nothing that is too bothersome most of the time.  Being a Sony A-mount, I have purchased three old Minolta lenses for a lot less than I would be able to the newer Sony lenses, and because the AF is in the body, these old lenses work great.  The menu system makes sense to me, the buttons are in convenient places, I really have no complaint.I have very large hands, and so my plan was to get the A57 for my wife and the A77 for me, but after using hers for a day I decided to deal with the smaller body and went with the A57.  Wonderful camera.  Very happy.

The mouse is pretty comfortable, and fits the hand well.The biggest complaint I had about it is that it didn't run on logitech's gaming software, but asof the last driver update it now does.  One small annoyance is the charging cord is stiff thick plasticwhich is not that great if your're trying to aim in a fps or something along those lines. To remedy this I justuse a different thinner and more flexible cable I already had (ironically from a different logitech device).

$REVIEW.: I've been burned by online battery orders in the past.  But 4 people had already rated this battery as positive, so thought I'd give it a try.  Battery in my Dell laptop had deteriorated to the point where it had one hour of life, but there was a message to replace the battery.  So I tried this one.I did the setup recommended by the booklet supplied, and after 3 cycles up and down, it measured 4 1/2 hours of life -- with full monitor brightness and not shutting off.  So I can expect much more when I dim down the monitor and turn it off when inactive.This seems to be a great battery, even better than the one supplied when the laptop was new.

It comes with a diffuser though you can also buy and cut gels to fit in the slide grooves or even just rubber band them on as I have seen done often..I have cut to fit many diff colors to fit into Mine.. works great.. I will be buying 5 more of these..  I have had mine for 8 months with HARD use and it still works..

$review_text.: I'm comparing these with the Shure e2c and the Ultimate Ears MetroFi 170 earbuds.  Based on the reviews, I thought these would be the best of the bunch, but they come in at #3.  I tried "burning them in" at a fairly high volume for a couple of days, and I've probably used them for 80 - 100 hours but they still sound dull and flat.  I listen through 3 different MP3 players, a mixture of rock, pop, R&B, and jazz, all with custom EQ, and it doesn't make a difference.  I'm really surprised at the glowing reviews; I don't understand.  If I wasn't doing A:B testing with other earbuds, I supposed I would rate them higher.  On the plus side, they are comfortable and due to the design, it's easy to figure out R & L in the dark.  If I had to assign a numerical rating to my 4 earphones, I'd give my old Philips (full sized headphones) SBC hp910s a 9, the Shure e2c a 7, the UE 170s a 5 and the Klipschs a 4. Oh, and they produce the weakest bass of the 4.  I do not recommend the Klipsch S4s, though they are a slight upgrade from the throw-away units that get bundled with some players.  I had my daughter, who has better hearing than I do, compare them with her much less expensive earbuds and she preferred hers.

Awesome picture for a 55 inch screen

colors a vibrant and no lag at all


This little project is the size of a large alarm clock and has hdmi and component inputs


Though I would have preferred a audit out from the projector, I can still overcome the lack of it using a audio out of source roku itself

Best projector for 199 bucks


Buy it.UPDATE after 27days of ownership:the picture started blurring and inspite of repeatedly refocussing it manually, still lost focus by itself within minutes.I got tired of refocussing it about 20 times during a 2 hour movie

$REVIEW.: The Canon Powershot SD1400IS is as light as a mouse and very compact.  I love the feel of it.  Some of the buttons are so small they might be hard to press by people with fatter fingers.  The camera starts up fast.  Outdoor shots in bright daylight in "Smart Auto" mode are generally pretty color-accurate and vivid.  However, indoor shots are noticeably blurry.  I compared test shots of the same indoor scene with an old Canon Powershot A80 and S2 IS.  Both other (much older) cameras produced much sharper images and with much better color accuracy.  Also, the rubber flap covering the HDMI and mini-USB ports takes too much effort to move for the cables to connect.There are so many 5-star reviews of this camera.  It's possible the one I received was an abnormality.

$review_text.: You'll probably ultimately like this skin but lower your expectations a bit before hand. IT WILL NOT BE PERFECT. Not even that close to perfect, but it'll probably be better than terrible. If you're thinking of any color besides black (natural wood, silver) forget it. The side protection strips are cut with massive tolerances around the port and speaker openings. To make it worse, the strips just don't fit! In order to make the openings line up with their respective ports, you'll end up with huge gaps between the strips. I mean 1/4" size gaps. This will definitely show in any of the other colors besides black but for black I guess I can live with it.The back panel fits fine but during the application I managed to permanently crease it so now there's a crease in it. Again not terrible but if it were the other colors it would jump out at you.Finally the screen protector. I ended up taking this off all together because after being what I thought was excessively careful in the application, I ended up with marks and bubbles that were still there after 5 full days (instructions say they leave within 2-3). It came off easily enough though.So finally I like the appearance (especially over the stock gTablet backing) and the feel of this carbon fiber skin but don't expect too much and you'll probably be okay with it. I just wish it was cheaper for what I ultimately got out of it. $30 for a skin I'm just kind of "meh" about it a lot to me.

$review_text.: What a great idea this is.If your computer has a vacant USB port (as most modern computers do) but you wish you had two (or three or four), this is the device for you
And to make it even a little better, you can now keep those ports connected and STILL have the ability to turn them on or off

That&#8217;s the beauty of this thing.When you cook up this Sabrent device, you can then hook up up to four devices, choosing when you want to run them
For instance, should you want to charge your phone, your iPad, your Kindle, your Nook (apparently you can&#8217;t make up mind about e-readers) or whatever, you just hook them up


Should one of them beep or click or bing because they&#8217;re done, all you have to do is tap the button next to its wire and voila! The power to it is cut off.Should you worry that you might wonder which of them you&#8217;ve tapped on, and which is tapped off, just look for the blue light next to the wire: if it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s on


No blue light, it&#8217;s off

That&#8217;s really handy, because some things (like the cooler fan I keep beneath my laptop) I like to keep on, and I want to know it&#8217;s on before things get hot &#8220;down there.&#8221;It&#8217;s really a great idea, and I have to praise Sabrent for the simplicity behind it.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.

For the record, I own both theNikon 18-55mm AF-S DX VR Nikkor Lens, and theNikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX Nikkor Lens. These Sunpak 52mm filters easily screw onto both of my lenses.This package includes both a 52 mm Circular Polarizer, and a 52mm UV filter. Each comes in its own container and storage case. The storage case is hard plastic, and while it does the job, it is not as nice as some of the Tiffen filter cases I own.The images I have taken using these filters are crisp and high quality. There is no vignetting (darkening of corners). The filters look durable to me, and Sunpak offers a lifetime warranty on both lenses. Overall, I am happy with the price and quality of these filters.
$SUMMARY.: Works Great on My Nikon Lenses

$review_text.: Got a new iPad mini and was thrilled to see this genuine leather case offered on Amazon. When it arrived I was very impressed with the quality and finish of the fine leather and the impeccable craftsmanship of the leather stitching and construction. So far five stars. I had read some of the reviews commenting on fitment problems so I made sure I read the instructions and watched the video. Bottom line, the case did not fit properly on closure (came up about one inch from closing all the way unless forced) as others have noted causing me many problems with the magnetic on/off feature. Twice it caused my iPad to lock up and I had to reset to get working again. Apple tech at Apple store said probably caused by rapid on/off cycling when I was trying to get cover to stretch and close properly. Whoever measured and made the pattern for this cover in my opinion was about 3/16 inch short on the flap width. In my opinion I do not believe the leather will "stretch" this much naturally in a reasonable time frame as I have heard this "stretch" nonsense for decades from shoe salesmen when their shoes were too tight on my feet. They never did stretch enough when I was dumb enough to believe them. I have many fine leather products made by Allen Edmunds, Hartman, etc. so while not an expert I do understand the characteristics of fine leather. Since I needed a cover I sent this one back to Amazon and purchased something else as I did not want to use my iPad as a stretching block. I did not contact customer service at the company so cannot offer an opinion on that part.

$review_text.: I have to agree with another reviewer who said his/her laptop worked great until 1 1/2 years after purchase. The same thing happened to mine. It just died yesterday and it's been about 1 1/2 years.... The same thing (booting for 1 second then the laptop shuts itself off on its own with a single beep) happened 2 months ago then it resurrected itself without any intervention. Then it happened yesterday and now it's long gone... The hp service reps are completely useless; they just try to get money from you by charing you for diagnosis then wanting to charge more if repair is needed. (I talked to them on the phone and I'm not shipping my laptop) I definitely don't want to do that so now I have to buy another laptop. I've never had any problem with hp laptops before (I owned 2 other than the current one, and both are still running well) and I kinda feel "betrayed" by hp... The laptop was indeed working well until it died. But 1 1/2 years of service isn't enough for having spent $1000.

Right now im not even overclocked and idle is 0 to 5 and full load around the 30*c's. I have amd's apu A8-3850 clocked at 2.9 ghz, crucial 16 gb of ram, seagate 2tb hdd, msi motherboard that's capable of overclocking. I did try to over clock and got to 4.3 ghz, but the onboard graphics wouldn't let me run all my moniters. so I just left it at normal. Definatly going to buy another one of these to build my moms pc, she plays sims and want her pc to be future proof. So im going to get her amd's 8 core cpu and crossfire it with amd gpu cards. but overall this is an awesome case. Also its huge, half my older sister and she is 5'0. installation was a breeze.

$REVIEW.: Numerous problems plague this mouse.  Lift it from your surface and try to mouse again and experience delays.  Buttons do not work in most applications, and are not recognized in almost any games.  They are also trying to replace their "MouseWare" drivers with a new 'SetPoint' software, with a tremendous reduction in features (less than 1/2 the button assignment options) and an incredible bloat (~17MB instead of 2-3MB).I would advise: stay away for the next month or three, while they work the problems out of this one.  Anyone posting to the contrary is probably not trying to make full use of their mouse, or otherwise is posting as an agent of Logitech...If you want more info for YOURSELF, go check logitech's User Support forums at [...] ... See what people are saying.  For every "I Love It" comment there are at least 6+ "Doesnt work anywhere" comments ...

$review_text.: I bought this a number of years ago from Amazon and this keyboard is not very good to me.  The buttons are really short and I have problems typing on it.  I have been typing on keyboards all my life and this is the only one that I have had trouble with the buttons.  Something isn't right with the spacing or something either.  Add that with intermittent wireless from 15 or so feet away and it is no fun to try and get anything done.  I only use this for a headless server when I need to direct connect (as opposed to SSH where I can use my Logitech Wireless K800).  Since I hardly use it I haven't returned this item but I wish I could.  I bought it because of generally high reviews but I am not sure those were warranted.

In fact, I came to check the specs to see if it will stand an upgrade to a new mobo and FX8120 8 core - new mobo's need a 24 pin, I cam to this page for a quick check.If you have any doubts - go for it

$REVIEW.: The item was as described.  It is small and very handy.  There are a couple of small problems.  The SDHC does not stay seated and had to be constantly reseated, if not, it will not be recognized.  The ejector button is on the back side so when you push it into the USB slot sometimes it moves the SDHC enough so that it will not be recognized.  It has to be pushed in with fingers on the sides.  If you can get it properly seated and it gets recognized, then it is really great for the small size.  I ordered two.  Once came with a nice little cord and an alligator connector, the other did not....don't understand why they were not the same......

$REVIEW.: I purchased two of these units to use with my Macbook Pro's (one for work, one for home). Connected everything up at work and all seemed to work OK....EXCEPT when I connected it to my Western Digital External USB 500gig drive. The drive never mounted. So I unhooked the hub and connected it straight to the usb port on my Mac. Still, it wouldn't mount. I figured my Extrnal USB drive just died on me coincidentally at the same time I connected it to this hub.Took the second Belkin swivel hub I purchasd home. Hooked it up to my home Macbook Pro (a different machine) and to a different Western Digital exteranl 500 gig USB hard drive (my home unit). Same result Smoked that drive too.BUYER BEWARE. THIS UNIT IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED.IT SMOKES WD USB HARD DRIVE CONTROLLERS.I'm a computer tech, so I was able to bypass the SATA controller and get the data off both my external USB Western Digital Drives. But this unit TOASTED BOTH CONTROLLERS. Keep in mind, this was two different Belkin swivel hubs smoking two different external USB 500Gig Drives on two different Macbook Pro's.STAY AWAY.

$REVIEW.: We love our chromebooks & this would be the perfect web surfing device if it just had a touchscreen like my Acer c720p.  This little chromebook looks much more expensive than it is & makes a great 2nd computer. The IPS screen on it coupled with the outstanding keyboard & good trackpad is a step above most other chromebooks I've tried. However, I prefer my Acer slightly to this one due to the lack of a touchscreen.  I use a smartphone & am use to tablets so that may matter to me more than most people.  This is still a great device at the price.Update - I've had a lot of keyboard problems with the Acer c720p in the form of some keys not working or only working now & then. This thing though,works great & I love the ability to charge this thing with my smart phone charger. NICE. As soon as Acer fixes or replaces my C720p I plan to sell it. I now have a high end Chromebook Pixel as my primary Chrome device (it is world class), but because I like this thing so much, I plan to keep it as a backup. Great screen, great keyboard & touchpad, & really attractive form factor.  If only it were a little more powerful with a faster chip. Still it is a great device to have on your lap as you watch tv, movies or YouTube. Highly recommended.Update - May 2014 I've been using both Chromebooks a lot since my last update & as a result of OS updates to Chrome all of my keyboard related issues with the Acer c720p have dissappeared. Why I don't know but they have. At the same time, I still love this thing for it's portability, looks, & keyboard. I find it great for texting & e-mails. However anything much beyond that & this thing slows down quickly or stops. Watching movies or videos on-line is pretty much a no go on this device. I've never managed to watch a two hour movie on this but if I did, my guess is it would take 4-5 hours & the battery would be long gone before that happened. The IPS screen is still great, the keyboard is pretty good, but I"m now finding the track pad pretty weak. If this thing had a Haswell processor & a bit better touchpad, & as long as I'm wishing, a touch screen, then it would be an Ideal Chromebook. But now that I've had time to use it for a while, I plan to sell it or downstream it to one of my kids.  The processor makes it's ongoing use just too frustrating. Get a Dell or a Acer c720p if you like a touchscreen as much as I do.  If you can, I might wait for the summer to see how the newer models turn out. Faster processors & more ram have to help the Chrome OS experience.

$review_text.: I was shocked at how small the thing was when I got it out of the box.  I installed the RAM and mSATA drive I ordered with it without any problems and got Windows 7 installed via a thumb drive in almost no time.  I did have to install drivers for the gigabit adapter prior to being able to connect to the internet, then was able to download the remaining drivers.The computer was super-fast, everything installed and was set up very quickly.  However, I bought this to act as a media PC to play movies stored on an external USB drive and even more importantly play HDTV from my HD Home Run network tuner.  The movies played perfectly fine.  The HDTV however, did not.  The TV was jumpy and skipped every few minutes.  It wasn't frequent, but was enough to bug me.  I tried a variety of fixes suggested on message boards with no luck, so I decided to return the PC and instead built a Micro ITX based machine with a video card.Summary: If you want a media PC to stream internet content or play movies stored locally, this will work great.  If you want to watch HDTV in Windows Media Center, you probably need something with better video processing.

It will update and reboot twice


Then you can start using it.I have installed Clibre and Adobe digital addition on my computer, both recognized the device.This device supports pdf  format also, the only problem with PDF is when you zoom , it does not pan automatically .You need to use D-pad to move around the page


To avoid this, you can convert PDF to EPUB (PDFtoEPUB software) .This device supports color picture books.My kids are enjoying the ebooks I have lent from local library.Sometime it takes time to load the book
if you see processing symbol on top right hand side of screen, you need to wait for the  book load
Once book is loaded, it will be fast.Page change sensors does not work sometimes

$review_text.: Bought this case in March, it's now November. This case does do a reasonably good job at protecting my tablet, but it has two fatal flaws.1. The case must be open to charge the device. No idea why they didn't just put another cut-out in the bottom of the case for the cable, and while this may seem like a small issue, it because more and more annoying as time went on.2. The case stays closed using magnets. Great idea. Small problem, the magent has managed to wear it's way through the microfiber lining of the case and is slowly scratching a hole in the screen protector. To me, this is a fatal flaw and would make me want to return the case if I could. I can't recommend that you buy this product, and I'm currently shopping for a replacement.

For one, the light isn't very evenly diffused on the kindle, so reading in bed with the light off is an uneven experience - the glare off the kindle display makes the center easy to read and the edges much less so.The clamp is adequate, but it does slide around a little. I suppose any tighter and you'd risk marring the finish.It's a decent alternative to those lighted covers, and you get what you pay for, but it's not perfect.

$review_text.: I am a Computer Technician by trade and know all the in's and outs of routers and how to set them up. I have gone through several name brand routers (about 6 or 7) and this Netgear model WNDR37AV is simply the best. Setup was easy, which was a welcome surprise. Although I know how to setup a router manually, I would much rather have the product just work...and this model does. All the other models I've had needed re-boots periodically. Not this Netgear! I have not had to re-boot since I've first set it up (February 2011).The dual band wireless is excellent! I have three wireless security cameras on the G band and laptops and Roku on the wireless N band. The cameras use a lot of bandwidth on the G band which is ok because they are the only devices on that band. They are always on and always transmitting, the Netgear router never misses a beat with them. I have a Roku Box in a bedroom connected by wireless N. Watching movies from Netflix or Amazon VOD through the Roku is flawless. HD (1080p) video over wireless is beautiful. No skips or waiting to retrieve video is seen (also there are 2 walls between router and Roku).To sum up...I am amazed by this router and would and do recommend this router for home use. Forget the rest...this model is the best!

$REVIEW.: I've only spent a few hours with it but I'm simply blown away. From the packaging, to the quality feel of all the materials to the ease of setup to the brilliant dual sided remote. In addition to announcements today that they're partnering with Netflix, Vudu AND Hulu? This is THE box - I've been down this road with the WDTV (almost every incarnation), the Seagate Theater+ and the miserable Popbox... there is simply no comparison even just after a few hours. It's the same interface we're all used to with the Boxee software but in a TINY form factor and the snapiness of the menu's is downright amazing. Thank god, this is finally the real deal. It was worth the wait, Boxee is here to conquer. Google TV is done, Apple TV is done.
$SUMMARY.: Truly, the revolution we all hoped it would be...

$review_text.: Although this a good replacement battery it is much like the original. It lacks battery life - Maybe I cannot blame the battery, maybe it is the laptop itself. However, I'd rather be able to use my laptop without needing a cord at all times sense my original battery was completely dead and would not take a charge. I still need to bring the cord with me even around the house because like I said it doesn't hold a charge for as long as I'd like.I do some extensive things. I tend to run a lot of programs at once as I am an amateur web developer. I would recommend this product to anyone with battery troubles - but don't expect much more than the original battery...

$review_text.: My original review is at the bottom, however since writing it I have returned the product for an exchange. Kudos to amazon as usual it was a quick and painless process. The second unit they sent me works great with 0 flickering problems. It seems that perhaps bizlink had a bad batch or just shoddy QA at the factory.-------------------- Original Review-------------------If you go to [...]you will see all the issues people are having. It is a BizLink adapter rebranded (also the same as the dell or sapphire) and unfortunately if you are pushing high resolutions in eyefinity it has the dreaded screen flicker in most cases. In my case the screen is actually flickering 50% of the time and is unusable. This might be an ATI problem and not an Accel one but his product is listed as "approved hardware for eyefinity" by ATI yet fails to function properly in a majority of cases.Spare yourself the trouble get a display with built in displayport functionality, if this is not fixed in the next version of catalyst I am returning this product if I can.

$review_text.: No isolation, the sound bleeds out through vents on the earcups, and you can clearly hear everything just as loud when you have it on as if you don't have something covering your ears.There's no point in buying and using these, why not just use speakers, it's practically the same amount of noise both ways in and out from the headphones to your environment.The 2nd gripe is that the earcups are a bit small, they go on your ears instead of covering around them, so after some usage, my ears feel some pain as the earcup cushions press against them for too long.3rd, the sound quality have some issues when there are high pitch notes, it starts frizzing instead of playing the high pitch notes correctly, Huge disappointment.

$review_text.: I used my ASUS tablet for a week before the dock arrived, and while I was very happy with my tablet before I used the dock, I think far more of the device as a set than I did as just a tablet.  Now, if I'm not needing a tablet, I can connect it to the dock, and literally go all day using the device.  I did a "intense use day" test on it, and literally ensured that the screen stayed on all day... and at the end of 10 hours, I still had 32% battery life left... which I thought was impressive!I've had the dock for 2 weeks now, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!  Here are my observations...I have no idea what the other folks are talking about with the device randomly turning off WiFi or not working when in "dock mode".  ASUS did an automatic update a few days after the dock arrived... maybe that patched whatever problem there was, because I have had no issues at all.The Docking Mechanism is firm - very firm.  The lock is very secure, and the hinge is quite tight.  The tablet weighs more than the keyboard, but the hinge also serves as a platform, so if the surface is relatively flat, it works fine.The weight is a bit less than the tablet, it seems to me, so it about doubles the weight of the device, but its worth it.  With the dock attached, it still weighs less than my netbook.The glidepad is very sensitive, and I tap it with my thumbs while typing from time to time.  Sort of wish there was a delay setting where it turns off if you're typing.  Maybe there is, but I haven't found it.  (My only negative, actually)A nice thing about the glidepad is that its multi-touch, which is an awesome feature, I think.The keyboard is laid out very well, and the dedicated keys are a big plus.The mouse pointer on the tablet when docked is a ring... it looks like the "busy" pointer on Windows 7, which took a bit to get used to.The USB ports work perfectly, and attaching a portable hard drive worked perfectly.  The SD slot is very handy, also.  I used it to charge my phone, which was pretty cool.email is way more functional, as are documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.Again, the sum of the parts is outweighed by the two together... it really turned my tablet into a completely useable tool!  It basically replaced my netbook, and I'm a die-hard windows guy.jb

$REVIEW.: this acer is my first adventure into chromebooks. i was aware going in, that the chromebook is a very stripped-down experience, basically a chrome browser window and the apps available from the chrome store. however, with the ever-expanding selection of chrome apps and a very ambitious linux universe, this browser-in-a-box can do so much more.first, let's talk about the machine itself. some have argued that this acer is basic and plain, even boring. i'm not the type who feels the need to express my creativity through the hardware i buy, so this is of no concern to me. what i do concern myself with is functionality. compared to the other chromebooks in this price range, the acer offers far more functionality than its competitors. with two usb ports, hdmi, sd card, and bluetooth, i don't feel like i'm missing anything connectivity-wise that i wouldn't normally get with a regular laptop (but for a fraction of the price). the design is not going to win any awards, but i like the clean, basic look. it doesn't distract you from what's under the hood and on the screen.speaking of under the hood, this thing smokes. with the haswell-based processor, 4gb of ram, and integrated graphics, everything i have thrown at it has been handled nicely. the screen is 720hd, and looks very good in most lighting conditions. the keyboard does not look and feel cheap to me, although others have made that comment. the only thing i've missed with this custom keyboard is the absence of home and end buttons (which may still be buried somewhere). my trackpad also does not click or rattle as others have mentioned. i've never been a fan of trackpads, and i'm still not sure if i like this one or not, but the two-finger controls are very handy in the absence of a regular mouse.now, for chrome os. for being as new to the game as this operating system is, it feels very polished and is maturing nicely. there are still a few functions that aren't as intuitive as i'd like. for instance, it should be easier to remove apps from the drawer on bottom. also, the ability to change ownership accounts is missing, and requires a full device reset instead. while these issues will likely be addressed in future software releases, they are a bit annoying right now. however, these shortcomings are generously compensated for, with the additional functionality offered through the chrome store. one of my favorite apps thus far is remote desktop. it's very easy to set up and even easier to connect. for a person who only has a desktop in his home, this allows me to take my desktop with me to the couch or the basement! add a chromecast accessory, and my hdtv turns into a desktop monitor. easy!one of the centerpieces of the chromebook (imo) is the ability to share and edit various documents through google drive. the google drive office suite, including docs, spreadsheet, and presentation, offers free versions of the office programs we've all used for the last 20+ years. the google versions are stripped out somewhat, but still offer most of the regular functionality you'd expect. also, the google office products are compatible with most standard office file types, including microsoft, openoffice, and libreoffice (with the addition of an extension). and when you're ready to store your documents, google drive offers you free cloud storage. this is key, because there's a very limited amount of onboard storage with the acer. i've been using drive for well over a year now. i use it to keep inventory spreadsheets updated at my bar, and also to make changes to tracking documents for my coin collection and my ingress user activities. all these things are accessible from my desktops at home and work, and my android phone, and any changes are automatically and instantly synced across all those devices. adding in the chromebook has given me an interface that's easier to use than my android for making changes, and obviously more portable than my desktops. not to mention cheaper, lighter, and longer-running than a standard laptop.another option i have added is the installation a linux distro (gnome gui with raring), which actually makes this chromebook an (almost) fully-functional linux laptop. with the limited onboard storage of only 16gb, my linux install must remain pretty light, but there is also a storage upgrade coming out soon for this acer. with 64gb or even just 32gb, this machine becomes much more versatile in that area.bottom line. this is a superb alternative to the still pricey laptop experience. for casual use, such as web browsing, streaming tv, and basic office productivity, this acer will do just about everything you will need. it also doubles as a cheap, yet powerful linux device. and chrome os will only get better over time, with new apps and software updates for free. why not give it a try? for $250, you won't find a better laptop experience.

This one is silent and still keeps it decently cool. I like the feature of the on/off switch and the extra usb port.  You can't really see the blue led's with the laptop on top, but it is a nice addition.  Overall I think its a great cooling pad and perfect for people who are always on their laptop.

I would have given it 5 Stars but didn't because it took me 10 minutes to get the  ##**!! thing on. I had to call on my inner power to get my IPad into the ArmorBox. It did not come with instruction on how to which implies this should have been simple, it wasn't. Oh yea, it feels durable but I haven't dropped it so I can't say if it will stop damage from being done but it looks and feels like it will cover down and do the job.

$REVIEW.: I needed something to lug to work and back with a bit more space than my briefcase.  Although I see plenty of adults on the street with backpacks these days, I wasn't sure if it was kosher yet in the corporate world.  I bought this one mainly on it's looks: I think its clean, subdued styling looks more mature than most packs.I've been hauling this to work every day for a week now, and it hasn't raised any eyebrows yet, so I feel its lived up to my expectations.  It seems fairly well made.  I'm not sure how well it'd hold up to heavy usage, but for the kind of light loads I carry, I expect this to last a fairly long time.The main body is split into two compartments.  The one closest to your back is a padded compartment for a laptop.  The other is a larger compartment that is big enough to fit my massive 60 oz thermos and a few items to the side of it, though only just.

$REVIEW.: Before this card, I was running two Geforce GTX 460s in SLi until one of the fan bearings died, and I decided to upgrade. This card is very good ( though for the price it better be ). I am mainly writing this review for people running three monitors because it was hard for me to find anyone running this card with three monitors to tell me how it was, so I took a leap of faith.This card is very well suited for mid-high graphics surround mode gaming. I've been playing borderlands 2 on mostly maximum graphics and averaging 40-50fps during fights and 60fps any other time. This seems to be the case with Just Cause 2 as well, and I can assume it will hold true for most high end games. ( I'd also like to note here that when playing with just one monitor, this card laughs at anything I throw at it )I will say this though; if you plan on getting this card in the hopes of running all the latest games on high graphics ( I'm talking maximum DX11 Tesselation high ), then this card won't fit your needs. On very demanding games like Far Cry 3, setting all the graphics options to maximum will land you in the 30-40fps mode, which honestly isn't bad, but as a mostly fps gamer who enjoys smooth gameplay, this didn't cut it for me. This holds true for almost all the games I've tried. Far Cry 3, Just Cause 2, and Borderlands 2 ( to name a few ) all needed their graphics tuned just a little bit under maximum to keep the frame-rate constant during big fights.In conclusion, The card is very well suited to playing games using three monitors. I don't know how long it can keep up 60 fps on three monitors for future games, but I know that if you don't mind switching to one monitor when the time comes, this card will last you a very long time.

$REVIEW.: This is a great product


Truely plug-and-play on my Windows XP laptop

No driver and extra setup required
I especially like the fact that it is solely powered by the USB port, which means no bulky transformers

The drive is the size of my spare laptop battery and is easy to carry around


The speed is decent but not particularly fast (the low power consumption limits how fast the drive can spin, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff of performance for portability IMHO).The black plastic case looks sleek, but it has the kind of shiny surface that's easily scratched and soiled by fingerprints
So get a protective cover if you care about its looks.One word of caution: if you ever need to reformat the drive, try to keep the FAT32 file system that it came in if you ever need to use it with non-Windows systems (say your XBox 360)


In order to do so you will need to download the FAT32 format utility from the WD support site (it's free)

 Windows doesn't allow you to format a drive with more than 32GB into FAT32.

$review_text.: It was the best of computers it was the worst of computers

 As you can tell, I am ambivalent about this convertible laptop

 First let me tell you the good news about this.1


 The Computer/Tablet portion of this is great.2

 This thing boots up faster than anything else I have ever owned


 The main reason I got a new computer was that my old laptop took minutes to boot up


 This despite getting a faster hard drive, more memory, etc


 It sped up a bit when I re-installed the operating system but not enough


 The ASUS boots up literally in seconds

 A big plus for the computer.3

 The battery life is just as good as advertised
 I can go all day with this without having it be plugged in.4


 The screen resolution is fantastic


 Everything is crystal clear.5
 The touch screen works fairly well, at least well enough for me


 My wife's iPad works more slickly but then again I don't like the restrictions of using Apple products
 They do what they do well but some things they don't do or allow you to do at all, but this is not an Apple review
 At any rate, I'm not sure if any deficiencies in touch screen functionality are attributable to the Operating system (Windows 8.1) or the device

 I lean towards the operating system


 On the other hand, I like Windows 8.1 more than I thought I would so this is a bit of a wash.6
 The sound is good to excellent for the size of the device


 It's better than my wife's iPad.Now for the bad


 Most of the problems were with the keyboard but some things can be related to the computer itself

 Right up front, before I enumerate the many, many defects, I'll tell you this is flat out the worst keyboard I've every used.1

 The first item relates to the keyboard but is actually about the computer

 There is only one USB port
 I have no idea what ASUS was thinking here


 This is simply not enough
 The touch pad on the keyboard is worthless, which I'll get into later, so I use a wireless mouse

 That requires a transmitter plugged into the USB port

 I know I could buy a blue tooth mouse but why should I throw away a perfectly good mouse


 I use USB drives extensively and if you plug in a USB drive you can't use the wireless mouse
 Worse, the keyboard charges via the USB port so I've got three things I want to use and I can't use them all at once


 It is extremely frustrating.2

 I mentioned the touch pad and I'll examine that more extensively here


 First of all, just navigating the mouse is difficult to do


 Often the mouse simply seems to disappear from the screen and then reappear somewhere else


 Next, you are supposed to be able to click or double click by tapping on a mouse pad

 This sometimes works and sometimes simply does not
 It doesn't seem to matter whether you tap lightly or tap hard, it simply will not work when it does not want to, which is often

 You get so frustrated with this you eventually want to put your finger through the touch pad, thus I stopped using it and started to use the external mouse
 Oh, and originally I thought I could get around this by learning to just use clicking on the lower left button but once again this sometimes works and sometimes does not.3

 If you don't type for a while and then go to type again it will not type right away
 I know with other keyboards I have used that usually the computer just has to catch up with things and eventually will enter on the screen what you typed on the keyboard
 Not with this keyboard
 It either simply does nothing, or even worse it will type multiples of the last thing you typed.4


 The keys do not have a good feel


 In fact the whole keyboard feels thin and cheap
 You feel like, if you typed hard enough you would go through the keyboard.5
 Occasionally the keyboard will disconnect from the computer


 I've tried everything


 I thought there would be an easy way to relink it but there is not


 What I've had to do is to reboot the computer and then the keyboard starts functioning again
 Not ideal.6
 The guts of the computer are in the screen, which is to be expected if you want to use something as a disconnected tablet


 The downside is that, if you use this on your lap as I do, it tips over very easily
 I've caught it in time thus far but it just seems a matter of time before I miss catching it.7

 My wife has a blue tooth keyboard for her iPad and it literally goes days between charges
 Not so with this keyboard

 Battery life is much shorter than the batter life of the computer, which can be very frustrating.8

 Once again, this charges through a USB port
 One thing I learned fairly quickly is that it does not seem to charge when the laptop is closed

 I'm not sure why but there were several occasions where I got somewhere, after thinking I'd charged it the night before, and the keyboard did not work and was not charged
 I have since resolved this problem by getting a long USB cord and plugging it into a converter and then into a socket so I don't use the laptop USB port

 This isn't ideal but it works

 BTW, if the battery runs all the way down I thought I could plug it in and get it to work but apparently this is not the case


 You have to wait until it charges up.9

 Of course it's difficult to tell how charged the keyboard is because there is only a light which is either white or yellow


 How much is left when the light is yellow is only your guess.10

 With all the problems with the Bluetooth keyboard I would occasionally use the software provided on-screen keyboard


 I'm not impressed by this also, although it works
 The keyboard does not automatically pop up the way it did on my Android and does on my wife's iPad, when you turn the Bluetooth keyboard off

 Also, nothing adjusts when the keyboard comes up which can create the problem that you can't see what you're typing in because the keyboard is covering what you're typing into


 You can get around this but you shouldn't have to.OK, so why did I buy this device?  Basically I had two devices


 I had a regular laptop that was getting old and slow to boot


 I also had an Android device


 The Android device was fine for doing very rudimentary things but was incapable of doing other things
 Also, I have several very intense spreadsheets I've done using Excel

 I would bring these spreadsheets into the Android device and any and all spreadsheets I tried, and I tried most of them, would either not work at all or worse, would make changes that would render the spreadsheet unusable in Excel, so I'd have to re-do them


 The bottom line is that Android is a wild west situation with applications

 There does not appear to be much in the way of quality control
 So I wanted a Windows device that could do everything I was doing with the two devices I had
 This looked like the way to go
 It wasn't, at least not as a complete solution.My recommendation, if you do or have to do a lot of typing, ie
use it primarily as a laptop, don't get this device

 It will leave you entirely frustrated


 If you want this primarily as a tablet you may be able to get around the deficiencies but you will still be frustrated from time to time.I am very disappointed in ASUS


 Why would you create such a great computer and pair it with the worlds worst keyboard?  It makes no sense
 After this experience I probably would not buy another ASUS and that's what happens when a manufacturer does something like this
 In fact I was going to give this a 2 star rating but because the tablet portion is as good as I described it I decided it warranted 3 stars


 Too bad


 This could have been something to rave about
 Instead it's something to rant about.

$review_text.: This is a nice little gadget to have if you have old VHS home movies lying around. My computer has Windows Home Premium 7, 64 bit, and I got this to work, so have to give this my recommendation.PROS:*Price.*It actually works, which is the bonus. Usually that is a crap shoot on an inexpensive electronic type gadget.CONS:*Instructions are in broken English. Regardless, it still took me a little time to figure out how to make this work properly. Audio seemed to be the biggest problem at first. Now everything is good.*You will need your own "male" RCA type cables to hook this up.*The software to create your DVD's is not overly impressive (what can you expect?), and it burns your DVD very slowly. So slow, you almost think it quit working. It gives you a progress bar, but nothing to tell you what your Burner is actually doing, like finalizing, etc. You will need patience, or better software.*Advertised as Keedox, but came in as a dreaded EZ Cap product, which seems to cause problems for others.OVERALL: A product that works, if you don't mind a little trial and error. It does what I wanted it to do, at half the price of many others.Gave it 5 stars because of overall value. Recommended.

First of all, I bought it for the 27x zoom, which from the sidelines is absolutely necessary to get into the action, and for its built-in stabilization system, the lack of which made long range zoom shots frequently blurry in the JVC &amp; Camedia 700. I bought an extra set of batteries, a nice, leather Olympus case and a 128 meg SmartMedia card.I spent about 2 hours with the fairly complicated and not too well written manual before gametime. I pretty much had decided to leave the camera in its 'sports setting&quot; for my first night,  which is accessible easily through the thumbwheel control knob atop the camera body (though this requires a little time in the setup menu, which I found pretty intuitive).Well, 48 plus minutes later I had shot 83 pics at a medium resolution (1024 x 768), and about 12 30 second QuickTime movies at low resolution (320 x 240). There was still a ton of room left on the 128 meg card, and the batteries were still juiced!The camera was easy to operate, easy to hold and the new electronic viewfinder is about as nice as it gets. The zoom was fine as frog's hair.When I got home, I installed the nice software package and connected the camera via the USB cable (supplied). Downloading took about 5 minutes (BTW, I ordered a SmartMedia FlashPath reader, but you-know-who didn't get it here on time, despite the overnight shipping charge...but I digress) and playback was a cinch. All in all, the photo quality was very good, though I think I can do better at freezing the action than the so-called &quot;sports program&quot; did. The QuickTime movies, even at the lower of the two resolutions available, were magnificent; they were better than the JVC digital camcorder and the sound was really high quality.Now this is no point and shoot, but if you have a little time and interest, I think the 2100 represents a great multipurpose digicam.
$SUMMARY.: This is really great!!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this card about four months ago for an older computer. Since then, this unit has been shifted to other computers on two additional occaisions. I found that the ports work much faster than most factory installed usb ports when using the "orangeware" software upgrade. The unit was recognized with windows xp pro without any upgrade but I found it works faster with my wifi adapter with the orangeware drivers installed. I recently purchased a new computer and moved this card into my son's computer. He uses the usb ports on this card exclusively because they perform better than the ports which came with his computer. This was my first "Belkin" purchase but it certainly won't be my last. I think this is a very well built, high quality product and would gladly reccomend it to my friends and family.Update: May 28, 2012. I have now been using this item for almost 2 years. It has been swapped out into 3 additional computers and it's still going strong. I wish all my electronic products performed this well. I'd also like to give "special thanks" to all of the other people who posted reviews on this product to assist my initial purchase. Amazon reviewers have been a tremendous help with all of my purchases.
$review_summary.: Excellent product. I highly reccomend this card!

$review_text.: I bought mine a little over a year ago.  It worked great then, and still does, but as always happens with electronics it has been out-classed by the current generation of video cards.  Still, if you want a decent card at a good price, this is it.One issue I had with this thing is installing it:  I had to use tin-snips and cut a section of my tower case in order to make it fit because it takes up TWO back slots even though it only uses one slot on the motherboard.Another issue that was easily fixed:  the wiring for the fans is long and loose, so it was getting caught in the fan blades and the thing would stop spinning and overheat.  So, I took the loose cables and taped them up out of the way against the inside of my tower case.  No more tangles.
$review_summary.: It was great when I bought it.

$REVIEW.: Installed on an Intel i7 2600K socket 1155 CPU.  The installation guide does not mention socket 1155 even though the sales literature lists 1155 compatibility.  Installation guide covers AMD AM2/AM3 and Intel sockets 1156, 1366, 775.  (Manufacturer's web site had same guide as received with the product so it provided no information on socket 1155 installation.)  Guessed that 1155 would be same as 1156 and this was a correct guess.Installation is actually easy but the lack of detail in the supplied guide can cause installation delays.  Step 1, prep of metal retention ring, provides horizontal clip orientation but not vertical orientation (refer to image on step 7 or 9 to get vertical orientation).  Step 2 (backplate prep) image shows socket information on 1 of 4 corners for mounting the tension clips.  If you use this orientation on each of the 4 corners, the backplate won't fit when you get to step 4.  The clip position for each corner is different.  The socket information for each corner is molded into the backplate in a small font and probably won't be seen until you realize the backplate doesn't fit.  In bright light with 20/20 vision, you can read the molded numbers and execute step 2 properly.  The remainder of the installation is sufficiently intuitive to execute properly with the minimal detail provided in the installation guide.Once installed, the performance is great.  System is OCed to 4.4 GHz.  Stock Intel cooling provided less than 5 minutes at 100% CPU utilization before the CPU temp exceeded 85 C.  This cooler keeps the temp below 70 C under all load conditions.  Using a BOINC project to achieve continuous 100% CPU utilization, CPU temp was typically 62-64 C at nominal GPU utilization.  Max temp was 67 C when both CPU and GPU were at 100% for an extended (>1 hr) period.  Computer cooling problem solved!

$review_text.: Considering the number of reviews of this IP Cam, I suppose my review is really not necessary, but here's my two cents.The picture quality is great in daytime & nighttime (IR) mode.  It's great to be able to tilt & pan.  The built-in software is fine for use with your computer's browser(s) but I really like using TinyCam Monitor Free with my Smart Phone and Tablets.  I wish there was a version for browsers.The only issue I've had is that from time-to-time it can't be accessed.  Some times a power down/power up will fix it and once I had to use some basic DOS commands from my Windows 8 computer to get it going.  Usually it will come back to life on its own but it's disconcerting if you're relying on the cam for remote viewing and you can't reach it.The mounting bracket give you lots of mounting options.  I didn't have any issues setting up the Cam with my router with Port Forwarding but I have better-than-usual computer skills.In all, even with the occasional dropouts, based on the price/performance ratio I give it 4 stars and may purchase more units in the future.

$review_text.: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ150 is a real joy to use. It has great performance, an excellent feature set, nice ergonomics, a serviceable viewfinder, a nice LCD on back, RAW shooting, a great video mode, a pretty good built-in flash. It is probably the most polished superzoom I have used and really is a pleasant camera to shoot with.When I first reviewed this camera, I noted mediocre image quality. Admittedly, this was a rush to judgement. The truth is that the FZ150 is capable of taking some very nice photos if you are willing to play around with the settings. If you just just iA (intelligent Auto) in all your photos, then I don't think you'll be all that impressed. But shooting manually and/or shooting RAW will get you some very nice photos. The photos might benefit from a little sharpening... but otherwise, detail capture is good, exposure is good. Color accuracy is spot on. It's really the best you could ask for given this class of camera.Autofocus performance is excellent. It is really is amazing how far these bridge cameras have come in terms of performance over the past couple of years. Shot-to-shot times are good. The menu system is pretty easy to understand and navigate. Although Panasonic packs so many features into this camera, that you probably won't understand all of its capabilities without reading the manual first.The LCD on back is of decent quality. Although like most, you have to crank up the brightness in the display settings for best viewing in direct sunlight. The EVF is a distinct improvement over previous Panasonic superzooms. Though I wouldn't really call it great though. It is usable. While this camera is constructed well, it feels a little more plasticky than its predecessors. But that also makes it a little more light-weight.The video mode on this camera is excellent. A great choice if you want a budget camera that does double duty for still and video. Admittedly I don't use the video much on this camera but from what I have seen it does excellent video. It even comes with an external microphone jack, which is a nice touch.The Panasonic Lumix FZ150 is a great camera that will appeal to wide range of folks. If you are just starting out with photography as a hobby and want a camera you can learn with, this is an excellent choice. It is overall an enjoyable camera to shoot with.

External noise is sometimes an issue, but I work in NYC so that's to be expected and these are not noise canceling


The in-line volume control is very handy and the cord is longer than most headphones, which is convenient when I need to stash the mp3 player in my backpack and set it down and keep the headphones on my head

I also use them when I watch TV and can turn my head so my ears are on the pillow and not have the earpieces dig into my head.

$review_text.: The video with the stabilizer is fantastic however, it takes a while for it to focus which is annoying

That's #1It takes great pictures especially at close range!It looks and feels great


Having a touch screen is fantastic
It's easy to use.It records sound very well however, because of the way it's designed, I tend to hold it where the microphone slots are and that muffles the sound
I got used to not doing that but it does happen from time to time
You hear your hand shifting around it


That's #2When you record the video, it will set either landscape or portrait depending on how you are holding it which can get annoying
 It should have a setting for a default set up which never changes


Maybe there is one but I can't find it

That's #3As a device on a tripod outdoors in bright light, it's wonderful but that's not what I need it for


I need it to record things like dirt bike riding, zip-lining, races, etc and it just does not cut it

It also really lacks in low light situation.I am going to order the Kodak Zi8 which I've read is leagues beyond.*Update:  I did the firmware update for this model and it has made the camera focusing problem much better


Upping it to four stars!

$REVIEW.: You might be like me and hang your TV over the old fireplace. There is no good way to get the cables to the tv and keep things looking clean. LG has a solution, wireless 1080 with integrated IR blaster. You still need to supply the AC power for the TV.I am able to put the whole pile of electronic junk in the room on the other side of the wall behind my fireplace. The TV receives all the IR codes and send it to the box in the other room that has 4 IR transmitters that you can stick on your tuners and such.It works through two pieces of drywall for me, about 6 feet of distance. It is designed to be in the same room.However there is one problem but I can't blame LG. The IR repeater has a problem with ATT's Uverse box. Seems that the box (made by Motorola) uses a new modulation frequency that is higher than older IR remotes. The TV has problems repeating this signal. I am going to ask LG if there is a fix for this. It does work but is very stubborn.

$REVIEW.: The strip itself is pretty compact, measuring only about 10.25 inches long.  The power switch is on the side, right next to the 6-foot long power cord.  Unlike previous Belkin Strips / Surge Protectors I own, the power switch in this strip does not have a light indicator, and also does not stand out because it is smallish and has the same dark color as the strip's black. The spacings between the outlets is not generous so a large-ish power cord plug can easily cover up an adjacent outlet, making it inaccessible for use.I haven't used this surge protector for long, but I haven't encountered any problem yet with all of the previous Belkin Surge Protectors I own (all of which are still in use), so overall, my experience with Belkin Surge Protectors has been positive so far.

 I prefer this shorter length so that I don't have to mess with longer cable tangles or worrying about the release hanging down to the floor while the camera is mounted on a tripod.This release does a fine job


 I will say that it is a very tight fit when plugging and unplugging it from my Pentax K200D

 I imagine it will easier with each connect/disconnect cycle.Press the button down part way and camera focuses; press fully and the shutter releases


 This device also has a sliding mechanism on the release button which allows you to lock your camera's shutter in the open position for long (bulb) exposures.I bought this because I want to remotely trigger my K200D while taking exposure bracketed photos

 I have the IR remote, but the camera does not support multi-exposure with the IR remote
 This device works fine for multi-exposure (bracketed) shots.

$review_text.: Bought this camera for a gift for my brother who has been an amateur photographer for over 50 years and who has spent tons of money on larger bulky cameras and attachments and after using it once he was AMAZED at the quality of the images and ease of operation in such a small camera with no needed lens attachments and having to set up every picture before shooting it.  It has the brain of Einstein.  When I saw the results and used the camera myself (never enjoyed picture taking) I rushed onto Amazon.com to order one in red for myself.  When the photos it takes were shown to friends and family they too were amazed and consequently had to buy one for themselves.  4 more cameras were purchasrd just by seeing the one my brother was given as a gift.  The secret to such quality photos must be in the Leica lens and the Auto Intelligence mode in this Panasonic Lumix camera!

Just enough room in the big pocket for my Surface Pro 2, and enough space in the little pocket for my Kindle (Gen 2).  No room for a power cord or anything else, but for a little travel case on the go to stuff in the seat pocket of an airplane, it was great.

$review_text.: If you are on a tight budget and needed a backpack that would carry your 15.4" laptop and some other stuff (books), this would a suitable choice.  I have camera and laptop backpacks from Lowepro, Tamrac, Ape Case, and Think Tank, and quality-wise, this Case Logic backpack is far, far behind those brands.  The nylon wall seems flimsy, the padding is on the miserly side, and the backpack does not have a good structural frame.  However, the aforementioned brands cost three or four times more for a similar functionality, so that's something to factor in.  As it stands, I would recommend this for a day use at school or work, but definitely not for foot-travelling or hiking where the backpack would stay on your back most of the times.The main compartment has a lightly padded divider that holds the laptop against your back; the front compartment is smaller and has storage for pen, USB flash drives, etc., and a zippered pocket.  A nice touch is another zippered pocket between the main and front compartment, which is made of nice felt-like material.  Ideal for storing phones or PDA or MP3 players.  There are two side pockets, ideal for storing water bottles or other sundry items.For the price, I think this can be a useful backpack, as long as you don't expect too much out of it.

$REVIEW.: This is the fourth dvd burner that I have owned.  I have this product for about a month now and actually use it, unlike most people I know. I had a liteon 1633S prior to this one that worked perfectly.  The problem I had with the liteon is that it failed in less than a year.  It may have been just a bad one but I wanted to try something else.  PCWorld and a few other sites rated this sony highly, so I decided to give it a try.  Since the plextor px-760a was rated highly also, I decided to buy it as a backup drive.  Well, now I get to compare.  The sony burns both single and dual layer disks faster and reads faster than the plextor even though the plextor has higher speed ratings.  I tried burning with different types of disks to compare.  Sony wins every time.  Its funny I never thought to buy the sony before, because sony has a good track record with me.  Anyhow, knowing what I know now, I wish I had two sonys instead.  I really have nothing bad to say about this drive.  It was better than expected.

$review_text.: This has got to be the second review I write on Amazon about their Amazon Basics HDMI cables, my opinion still stands: why buy overpriced cables if you can get these at a reasonable price?I recently got a laptop with HDMI output, while I use my PS3 to play most of my videos, photos and the like, there are times in which certain files can only be seen in the computer
While my LCD does have the monitor input I felt more inclined to use the HDMI from the laptop, after all, why not use the HD set as intended?Since the laptop is mostly used in our living room, where our home theater is, I needed a cable not too long so 6.5 feet was perfect, I do not need to be right in front of the TV and I don't have the cable all across the room.Video and audio quality is great and since I started using these I have had no issues whatsoever (I once owned a Sony HDMI cable that gave a me a 'Video Input not recognized' error message from time to time, I switched it to an Amazon Basics cable and problem solved!)The frustration free box contains a pair of 6.5 feet cables

 For the price and quality, you can't go wrong with these!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this receiver because it appeared to be a good value with many of the features that I wanted.  My setup is really simple, HD TiVo & PS3 connected to a Pioneer Plasma TV.Well, connect it all up and thing seem to all work, then I skipped forward with my TiVo, and all the audio dropped out.  Hitting pause and replay fixed this issue, but only until the next skip.  1 out of 5 skips causes dropouts.  Tried several different high quality HDMI cables and nothing helped.  It appears that they don't have consistent HDMI handshakes.The second problem that this has is that the HDMI control is wonky.  I figured that Pioneer Plasma and Receiver would work well together, but that wasn't the case.  Turning the TV on will turn the receiver on, but turning the receiver on does not turn the TV on.  Further, every time I turn the TV on, it changes the input to "TV/Sat", which of course has no input whatsoever.  What about an option to have it not change the input, only control power?  No option appears to be available.I emailed their tech support, who told me that they couldn't help and I should just call.  I called their tech support, waiting for 30 minutes to have the support person provide no solutions to these problems.Bottom line, I wouldn't get this again (because I have a TiVo).

It is a compact unit (considering is a 4 channel) that most likely will fit under your seat or anywhere in the trunk. As you may know, qualifying sound is very subjective but this combined with a pair of Infinity 6030cs components in the front and 639i coaxials in the back is really overwhelming. It is definetly worth the money. My only complaint is that i don't have another for my other car.

$REVIEW.: I've owned ATI/AMD video cards as long as I can remember, I purchased this model as an upgrade from my Radeon 6870 model.  I'm a gamer but only tend to buy the mid-range line as I don't feel there are any games out there that are currently pushing my system to the limits.  I never go with a stock cooler video cards because they tend to be loud, and just look boring, so I tend to always get an overclocked model or one with a decent heatsink/fan.  HIS is well known for their IceQ coolers and this model is no different.With this card I am able to run Battlefield 3 on Ultra settings and getting about 40-45FPS most of the time running an Intel I7 3770k with 16GB (not overclocked).This card is amazingly silent I don't hear it spin up at all.  It is a ginormous card though.  I'm using a Corsair 600T case and this sucker just barely fits in it (because of where the hard drive cages are).AMD does a great job with the driver releases with a new set every month and they are very into player feedback and the community.I did have an issue getting my Mail-in-Rebate but that was not HIS's fault, I think it was because the date from Amazon was wrong since when I ordered it, it was on back order.

Not an issue if you leave it in highway, which would probably mean you love to detect automatic doors and other false alarms, I however prefer city mode 2 which requires pressing the mode button several times, and more annoyingly you have to wait till it goes thru it self diagnostic. I think this is a good detector but also think there must be a better one out there for a similar amount of money.

$review_text.: I purchased this from Amazon to insure I got a real Apple charger. There are many knockoffs and fakes (complete with Apple wording on the back) so I am glad Amazon now offers this themselves. I saved about $5 vs. an Apple Store and shipping was free.I thought all chargers were pretty much the same, until I read a detailed technical article which both tested and disassembled chargers from several name-brand companies as well as some knock-offs/fakes. Apparently the Apple has the "cleanest" power output of any phone charger, including those from such excellent rival companies as Samsung (only an HP tablet charger was rated higher). This same article also lambasts Apple for charging $29.95 for the classic cube charger - but you may have noticed that the Apple Store price is now just $19.95 and the Amazon price is even $5 less. So for the revised pricing, this charger imho is a "best buy".Note that this is rated to put out 5 watts, but tested as putting out 6 watts, 20% more. In addition, most chargers delivered less power as they came closer to full charge, but the Apple continued to deliver more power. Although reviewers note that this compact cube charger only puts out half as much power as an iPad charger (even less than the increased 12 watt output on the iPad 4 charger), I have easily charged an iPad 2, in sleep mode, with my 5W Apple cube charger. It really puts out! Charging times are naturally longer, and you WON'T be charging an iPad 3 or 4 while playing a power hungry game - you will barely stay even with the power consumption - but if you can accept the longer charging times, the Apple cube charger WILL work.I was hauling around a 12 watt iPad 4 charger for all my Apple (and non-Apple!) charging needs, until I read the article and realized I wasn't overloading the Apple cube charger by using it to charge bigger devices than the phone, Touch, and Mini devices it was designed for. It charges at half the rate on larger devices, but for travel that still means even an iPad charges up overnight. I also use the Apple cube now on my Google Nexus 4 phone etc. simply due to the higher quality of the power output. I haven't noticed any slowdown in charge time on non-Apple devices.I will link to the power charger reviews in the comments section.

$review_text.: I just replaced my trusty ZS3 with the new ZS7 and, so far, I am very pleased with this camera

The output is much cleaner and smoother than the ZS3's, much more refined
Compared to the ZS7, the ZS3 produced images that look brittle and over-processed

As with virtually all small-sensor cameras, the ZS7's images are a little noisy (even at base ISO) if you look close enough

But noise is far less objectionable than ragged edges and smeared details, which is what I usually got from the ZS3


The images I'm getting from the ZS7 look surprisingly good even at 100% on-screen enlargement; whereas the ZS3's output was virtually unusable at this magnification

The improvement is dramatic
Considering that the ZS7's resolution has also increased from 10 to 12 MP (it's actually a 14 MP sensor that is masked to create different aspect ratios), I'd say that Panasonic has done a really good job here.The ZS7 improves on the ZS3 in several ways; but for me the most important new feature is Picture Adjustments, which let you turn down the amount of sharpening and noise reduction that are automatically applied to every image
Photographers who do their own post-processing will appreciate the ability to apply their own preferred methods of sharpening and noise reduction.The next most important new feature (imho) is the addition of aperture/shutter-priority shooting modes
There isn't much latitude for adjusting the f-stop in most small-sensor cameras because of defraction effects; but it's great to be able to control the shutter speed manually.The ZS7 also adds GPS, which can (thankfully) be turned off
Leaving it on shortens battery life.Other improvements that I appreciate include (1) improved image stabilization, (2) new Venus processing engine, (3) High Dynamic mode, and (4)  the LCD now has a good anti-glare coating.All things considered, the ZS7 is an impressive upgrade that is easily worth the price.

$review_text.: Prior to my purchase I shopped around and researched reviews inside the Amazon community and other photography forums
This light came out on top with the lowest price yet matched the features of more expensive LED lights in the same class and LED count (160).Initially the light functioned well during tests with standard AA batteries
So after a week of use, I decided to invest in 2 rechargeable batteries and a charger (Sony NP-F550 equivalent)


However, during an actual shoot, the light would not turn down or off


The only way to turn it off was to remove the rechargeable battery.I replaced the AA batteries instead of the rechargeable to see if maybe the rechargeable was causing some odd malfunction, but the light immediately came on to full brightness and would not turn off until the batteries were removed
I thought maybe I had over-heated something so I allowed the light to completely cool for an hour then test it with both types of batteries again


The light was still malfunctioning and would go straight to the brightest setting regardless of the adjustment knob.I then requested a refund and returned the unit with Amazon's fantastic free printable return shipping label

I then purchased a second unit to give it another try; mainly because I had already invested in the 2 rechargeable batteries

The new unit functions flawlessly, but I will keep an eye on it and update this review if it begins to malfunction like the first one.As far as the light, it is very bright at its highest setting


What I like is that the light adjusts from its lowest to highest level with a rotating knob to any desired level you prefer

It appears to be all plastic construction

It has a push-button battery level meter (4 red LEDs)

It comes in a commercial box with a simple manual

Included is a swivel ball-type mount with -20 screw on one end and a cold-shoe mount on the other

Also included is a plastic battery adapter which helps support 5 different battery types

There is also 3 plastic slide-in light filters.There are plenty of YouTube video if you need to see this light in action.

$review_text.: You do need this lens. If you got an E-something-'er-ether and are thinking you want to try out a small, prime, faster lens and you are on the fence about it; let me knock you off.It is "that much faster". In a room at 9am with 2 big windows, F2.8 it shoots at 320. This is a feat the kit F4 would have to struggle with at 25. In the sun, 11am, f2.8 I found it to shoot at 3200-4000 until with good white brick reflections it was overexposed and I had to pull it down to f16 (at which point it still shot in the 200 range. The sharpness is suburb throughout.If you have had difficulties with the kit lens's manual focus you will be impressed with this. The focusing is smooth and firm and the subject can be pulled into frame in split seconds. The action feels comfortable and natural with the left thumb as you clamp the top with the remaining fingers.It has a metal gasket that makes a tight fit. I'm not planing on putting mine to the test on purpose soon, but I would imagine it could stand up to some good wind blown dust and sprinkler mist that plagues us so. It seams to be built of a metal shell with plastic or resin coverings and the feel of it in your hands is like a little stone to skim across the pond.The kit lenses have a small skip at times when powering down, that of which I have not experienced at all with this.But it's not all great. The cap has been demeaned with all sorts of profanities and I completely know why. I managed to drop it twice on the first run! You may imagine it's raised but it is actually recessed with the exception of a small serrated ring. You have to push down and spin, there is nothing to pinch or pull.I can guarantee you will be happy with it. You will also be sure to find me with this lens on 95% of the time from now on. The kit lenses are only coming out for wide or tight occasions. I have found myself frustrated with the fact there are so few options in the 4/3 mount but I am no longer. Zuiko has proven themselves to me with this low end standard, I can only dare imagine what the high end (and the 45 years I'll have to work to pay them off) will hold.

$REVIEW.: Received the product within a couple days of purchase. Well packaged and protected. While opening and fiddeling with the product, it was incredibly hard to open the stand. Once I was able to pry open the bottom legs..it wasn't going anywhere. I attached a larger softbox to the stand and it held its own quite well.Pros: Stable, will not fall or come lose, Incredibly convenient/small, great for use as a small boom, low-level light during shoots[add a sandbag for heavier top attachments.]Cons: Very hard to open and close, have to losen all nuts on the legs then tighten to lock, no travel bag, surprisingly short.The price is worth it if you are on a budget[who isnt] and you are in need of a very short light/mic stand.

I was actually surprised when the case arrived..it was more pampering than I really expected.....and of course it has the Rand McNally logo, which perpetuates the love affair.

$review_text.: I bought this on a whim because we were going camping and I thought it be a great idea to use it for our entertainment during our 5 day camping trip. It was totally freaking awesome. We spend the day boating, hiking, fishing, etc which was totally fun, but at night we used this screen along with my projector,laptop, generator for picture slide shows and movie nights on lake, followed up with you-tube karaoke tethered off my iphone. We were on our own private island at Lake Shasta so no neighbors to bother, serveral boaters came but and couldn't believe their eyes. It was so fun! We traveled with 5 other families and they were blown away at the setup. They have never done camping like we did it with nature and technology blending in seamlessly.  It kept the kids entertained at night and gave us an opportunity sit back by the fire and be city slickers.Setup was easy, this thing was not tied down for the entire 5 days and felt very sturdy so i'm not sure why others are complaining that it would tip over. Tip, take a pic of the layout of all the poles, then laminate it and put it back in the case. That way you can easily find out where everything goes when you put it back. I have loaned this thing out more times that I have actually used it. Everyone says it's awesome and easy to setup! I plan on putting two posts in the ground in my backyard behind my pool retaining wall and just use PVC piping and this screen so I extend the use for movie nights in my backyard during the summer months. See my pics from camping.

$review_text.: I've been a long time Sony headphone customer for many years. It seems that one of the best kept secrets of the industry is the fact the Sony makes great sounding headphones and they don't charge a lot for it. These ear buds are cheap (I define cheap as under 20 bucks). I think they get overlooked as many people would look at them and think they have perhaps the same sub par sound as the included ear phones in many of today's electronics based on the price. They are are wrong.The advantage of in ear buds is that they are the original "noise cancelling" ear phones. Why? Because they plug your ear like ear plugs! This gives them a distinct advantage as most of the noise you hear is from the headphones.What makes these buds good?The tonal quality is good. Highs, mids, and lows are distinct and separate. The range is nice. The bass is strong. Sure you could get other buds that have stronger bass (even Sony has some that have stronger bass), but I felt this was enough to be quite present but not overpowering. I have a discerning ear. That being said I like my "lows" more then I like my "highs". I was not disappointed.The only con I can see is the quality of the wire might not be as good as others. Seems kind of thin even compared to my previous Sony ear buds. Overall it shouldn't be a problem as I don't really plan to wrap them tight or anything.Could you buy better ear buds? Sure. Bose, Sony, Klipsch and others offer them at premium prices. Could you buy better ear buds under 20 dollars? No way.

$REVIEW.: Setup of the DIR-628 was a breeze; it replaced an existing router, and I was able to get it up and running in about 10 minutes. The router looks fairly bland, but most people will have their router locked away in a cabinet anyway.The DIR-628 does not offer Gigabit network ports, which would have made it the perfect router in this price range. The user interface is very easy to navigate and there are no long reboots after you change each setting, like on other brands of routers.The wireless performance is impressive; I switched from a different brand router, and my wireless range has doubled with this device. I tested it using my Dell laptop with 802.11n, and the range/speed was perfect. In my house, I also have several 802.11g devices, but when they connect, the router speed drops to this slower network system and the 802.11n does not come to its full potential.Being able to switch to 802.11n on the 5GHz band is the perfect solution for anyone who lives in an area with a lot of other wireless devices, as the 5GHz band is barely used, but it is fairly useless if you are in an area with little to no other wireless. The 5GHz band is also not supported by all that many devices, in my case I had to leave it on 2.4GHz to support my Tivo and other wireless devices.All in all a great router, a great price, and something that would be worth 5 stars if it had Gigabit network ports.

$REVIEW.: If you are an audiophile I am sure that you'll find plenty of reasons to knock these headphone down a few pegs but if all you're concerned about is being able to hear your music without it sounding terrible then these will do just fine for you.I like the fact that the length of the cable is pretty long.  At least longer than my other headphones.  I am a pretty tall guy (6'3") and with some headphones the cord will actually tug if I have it plugged into a device near my waist - this has plenty of play.I like wearing these when I am out mowing the lawn and doing yard work.  Since they are of the "in ear" variety, they fit nicely under my headphone style ear protection that I wear.I have also started using these in the house as well when I am doing work on the computer that requires audio and I don't want to interrupt others watching TV.I was a little surprised at how comfortable they are (although I think comfort is going to be on a person-by-person basis).I have found the inline microphone to be extremely useful and can use these as an alternate hands free device for my iPhone.I also like that the jack is a straight plug and not at a right angle.  I have found that some right angle jacks hit surrounding plastic on certain devices and don't allow the plug to insert fully.Overall I am very pleased with these headphones.  The sound quality is more than adequate for both listening to audio and also when using the mic.

$review_text.: Edit: A month (or so?) later. I'm on Amazon right now to purchase a Roku 3. The remote on this is horrible. The laggy UI is downright painful. It's just cheap. Cheap crap. If you're in the market for one of these, a very frivolous commodity, then you have the money to purchase something that's not, flat out, just a piece of cheap crap. Get a Roku 3 or some other device that may cost more, but won't make you want to toss the remote through your TV.And since I didn't discuss it in my initial review, the android app that controls the device as a remote? Worse than the actual device. I'm talking 15 second lag. If you're lucky.Initial Review:The UI on this thing is atrocious. I say that not because I'm a snob that thinks all UIs should look alike, but because it's horribly, horribly, horribly laggy. You hit a directional to move the cursor and there's always between a 1sec-3sec delay. Going from the home screen to being inside of a stream on Netflix takes upwards of 2 minutes between the loading screens -- and no, I'm not including the buffering.Now, that said, it does exactly what I want it to do. It acts as a near perfect XBMC extender (through DLNA). It plays everything from my DivX to my mkv just fine. Once Netflix is loaded, it streams it in perfect HD as well. (Which is why the lag is so frustrating, if it has the power to decode 1080p files, it can handle a simple UI -- it's just sloppy, unmotivated coding causing the lag).So four stars. It's cheap. Cheaper than a Chromecast, and can do much more (DLNA). If you're looking for a very low cost device to act as an extender to your main XBMC HTPC, this will do exactly what you're looking for. Just go in to it knowing the UI is a nightmare.

$REVIEW.: The Cyber Acoustic 2.1 speakers are not the best money can buy, but are the greatest $30 speakers you can buy.  I previously owned the Logitech Z506's and those failed on me.  Two of the speakers popped.  I was pretty angry that they did because i paid $100 for them and they couldn't survive the abuse i was giving them.  I needed new speakers,but i wasn't going to pay nearly as much as I did with e Z506's.  So, I turned to the Cyber Acoustics which got good reviews and were at a pretty good price.  Boy, did I make the right choice.  The speakers are pretty good and the bass is also pretty good for the price range.  The bass doesn't get all muffley at peak volume  The system as some kick to it and you can definitely feel and hear the bass through the wall.  If your in a small room these are great, but if your looking for something with more kick, then look in the higher price range.  I mean for the money, these are pretty good speakers, you can't go wrong with them.  Hey they even give you an extra short Aux cable and an MP3 player stand!

$review_text.: I have a third gen iPad that I moved a nice thin black snap cover to from my iPad 2...  The problem was despite claims that "it'll fit both", the third generation iPad is just a bit thicker, and so it didn't quite fit right.  And over the course of the month or so I had this other cover on the new iPad, the corners started cracking out of the blue, and small pieces would fall off.  Finally last week the last piece of the top fell off, and it would't stay on at all anymore.  Now, I baby my electronics.  I never even so much as dropped this thing a foot onto my heavily padded mattress... So there was no stress, no dropping, nothing other than simply "being on it" that caused the stress cracks and breakage.So I started looking for a new one for the third gen iPad, and came across this.  The price was great, so I figured even if it didn't work, I was out basically nothing.  So I ordered it and got it.It's a little thicker than the one I had been using and it fit just great.  Snaps into place and you can wiggle the corners a bit, so you know there's a little bit of wiggle room there, it's not tight to the point of causing stress fractures over time.I like the material.  The one that broke was a real slick surface, this one, while still a hard plastic, has a little more grip to it.  And I actually like the cut out of the apple logo on the back since that gives a good spot to get a finger or two to hold the edge of the case for a little more security as well.Cover came well protected with sticky plastic stuck to it to prevent scratches.  Works great with my smart cover I took from my iPad 2 when I gave it to my 8 year old.Can't beat it for the price, and for the quality at this price, it's a steal.  No-brainer for me, this was a good purchase.

$review_text.: When I ordered my iPad from Apple, I also ordered their case. What a disappointment. It was so flimsy that I went on a mission to find something better--had to protect my investment! Checked the cases available at Amazon and had it narrowed down to two. I decided on this one, and I am glad I did. It's a great case, and the cost is incredible for the features. It is very nicely padded and the bumps on the other side work well for keeping the iPad upright (especially great for watching movies). The only detraction (as some others have stated) is that the edge by the on/off button does buckle somewhat. Five Stars nonetheless! Even though it is not REAL leather, it looks like it, but, more importantly it is constructed well. I have since looked at other cases in stores, and I think I made the right decision with this one. I don't think you will be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: (Update below)Upgraded from an iPad 1 (aka an iPadosaur) If you are used to an older iPad, do your homework. Navigation is way different.BTW. If you are running on battery only and don't need location services, shut it off. Its a huge battery sucker.BTW#2: I almost bought a longer charge cable for this (newer lightning connect style) since the one that comes with it 4' is too short for the real world. Instead I spent $3.00 for a 6' USB extension cord to extend between the charge module and lightning cord. It works fine and will keep the battery at 100%  while I am working. IF location service is not activated.One gripe about the AIR seems to be reduced battery life. Shut off the services and features you don't need on all the time.(UPDATE 5/5/14)Been using the #5 air for over a month now... I LOVE IT! Theres a little learning curve moving up from iOS 5 to 7+, not an issue. I had no problem moving my "stuff" including apps, to the new iPad.... The finti cover, is sweet, too! Recommended!Next on line is an iPad mini (soon) and I'll elaborate a bit....I use a verizon mifi modem with my pads when I travel. (converts cell-wireless to wifi) Internet/email anywhere. Works great. In doing this, I have scrapped my cell phone and installed skype phone on my iPads... Flawless voip service, full feature with dedicated phone #... All for $6.00 a month a $.o2 a minute pay as I go. Compare that to the cost of a smartphone with data package! So saying, a mini will fit in my pocket as a large smartphone and serve all my needs on the road... IN MY POCKET...iPads are truly "swiss army knife" devices if you get the apps and set them up right. Most don't understand all the things an iPad can do.

$review_text.: The Amazon Basics 16 GB SDHC card is a decent though BASIC card.  It is a class 4 card which means it will not work for high definition camcorders (most high def videos require class 6 and above).  Ultimately the card is great for basic photography needs using simple point and shoot cameras but you may be better off buying a higher speed card so that if you upgrade to a high definition camcorder in the future you wont have to buy new memory cards for it.  The price is not the lowest and you can actually buy some generic class 10 cards (from TRANSCEND) for a similar price.*** Positive Points: ***- Competitive (though not lowest price)- Good build quality that is made Taiwan (not China)- Frustration free packaging is a great change from plastic sealed "tombs" that most cards come in- Comes with a large sized plastic carrying case.*** Negative Points: ***- Only class 4 speeds so if you buy a high def camcorder in the future you will need to buy a faster card- Only a 1 year warranty.  Most other manufactures provide 5 years to life!- Price is not among the lowest despite this being a generic card'OVERALL: This is a decent card but there are better (faster) choices for the same or less money.

For example, touch it with gorilla tape even for a second and try to pull it off, you will delaminate it.  same goes with duct tape.  I still can see the folds in the material where it was folded up in the box.  I made a portable movie screen on a roller instead of a permanent wall mounted fixture so I do not have a way to stretch it to get rid of the folds.

$REVIEW.: Get the drive - forget the case!There is a horrible design flaw in the case. The mini-USB connector is directly soldered onto the control board of the case. This means that any shock on the usb connector is instantly transferred to the solder and eventually, in my case, the mini-USB connector popped off the PCB. They should have provided a wired connection from the USB to the PCB so that it is isolated from each other. I am not going to bother returning it. Instead, I'll buy a cheap case from a store and install the drive in it.Again, horrible connection design.

$review_text.: This is a great little charger! Very compact and portable! Comes with a retractable cable with 2 attachments for a micro and mini usb cable. Uses a micro usb for charging the external battery pack and will work any micro usb cable you have laying around. There are indication lights on the device as well to inform the use of the current charge and use state. There is a power button on the side as well to tell the device to start outputting the power. There are 2 full usb ports on the the front for 2 devices you want to charge. They both have a rating of 5v and one is at 2.1 amps and the other is at 1 amp for those that know what this means.There is also a nice carry pouch that comes with this as well with draw strings. There is plenty of space for the battery pack, the cable, and accessories this comes with. Depending on the size of your phone, it may fit in as well. My sprint nexux 4g will fit in with the charger as will my og evo 4g.This will charge with ease my sprint nexus 4g and my og evo 4g.If you look on whatever device charger you are wanting to charge with this and it is outputting 5v/ 2.1A or 5v/1A then this should work, sense it will be power and rate of flow as from your current charger.This is great for camping or for power outages, anytime when you will want to be able to charge your phone without easy access to an outlet. Also being able to charge 2 devices as once is very nice!I love this and would recommend it to anyone!

$REVIEW.: In theory, the Kanex SnapX would be great for me. I could hook up two macs to a monitor and easily switch between them. However, only one of the display cables was functioning on arrival. So all I had was a 1x switcher...The weight of the central box is very light while the cables are very heavy and non-flexible, so this won't stay on the desk very easily, unless you clip it or otherwise attach it to something. The clip is clearly designed for a thin based monitor, i.e. an apple display, so it probably won't clip to another vendor's monitor if it has a thicker base.The switching button on my SnapX was noticeably askew. I don't know if this is related to the problem I was having with one of the cables not working.

$review_text.: The Keedox Android Smart TV Box is an excellent solution for an affordable media player. Running 4.2.2 Android OS, access to the Google Play Store, and XBMC playability are just a few of the features on this device.The Android media player uses a quad core CPU, 2 gigs of DDR3 RAM, and 8 gigs of Nand Flash for custom installs and installed apps. This device also supports external hard drives up to 2TB, and has an SD/MMC card reader that supports up to 32GB.On the back of this Smart TV Box, you ahve the power input, AV Output, HDMI Output, LAN, and a Digital Optical Audio Output. A home theater system that's close to the size of your hands and powerful! Offering a chance for surround sound and HD quality movie/TV watching.This media player also has Wi-Fi and although you can't see an antenna, the signal is actually quite strong. Wireless N/B/G are fully capable with this system. I haven't had any interruptions while using Wi-Fi, but I did have HD playback issues. I didn't have the problem with the hard wired connection, sometimes the HD file playback on Wi-Fi can cause issues, but it wasn't the players issue.Along with the Quad Core Smart TV Box, they throw in a remote that works well with the system. The remote features the most important buttons you need and you have full access with it.

$REVIEW.: This was the first bag I purchased after buy my DSLR camera.  I like the idea of the convenience of a sling.  When I beganusing it I found it to be a bit big and awkward to be used &#34;on the go&#34;.  For instance I would never feel comfortable wearing it whileI was actively moving around shooting pics. I wouldn't change a lens or filter without putting the bag down. I even find it awkward toput it into sling position to carry it. I usually put it over one shoulder.  I have no use for most of the buckles and straps on the bag and find them in way sometimes.  I'm short and since I'm new to photography I'm generally awkward when shooting. I'm sure this all plays a part in how the bag works for me.  The bag is big and so far it fits all my stuff (camera with 4 lenses and accessories). I like the configurable soft dividers in the main compartment.  I use it to store my stuff in one place at home and I bring it places when I think I'll need multiple lenses. I bought two other smaller camera bags that are better for me to use on most outings. My photography teacher says camera bags are like purses.  A girl will never have enough.

$REVIEW.: I bought this product mainly to replace my notebooks for notetaking during lectures.So far so good
I've been using the S Notes to take hand written notes and have been excited to see how well it looks like actual hand writing

I can also write very small and the tablet will still recognize what I write


It pretty much mimics the paper and pen very well


The only down side with this is that I take notes with tablet while it's in a horizontal orientation

Thus, I have to scroll down once I fill up the screen


This is not a big problem since S Notes uses a program that will only recognize the stylus for writing so you can use your finger to easily scroll down the page while taking notes.The Tablet keeps up with your writing very well


It also can sense pressure.I've looked at the Windows 8 tablets like Surface Pro 2 and Thinkpad Tablet 2

They also come with a stylus and take notes very well


However, they both cost over a thousand dollars

They are worth every penny though since OneNotes is pretty much the best note taking application on the market and has it's full features only for Windows computers


However, I wasn't willing to spend that much on a machine I would use primarily to take notes on so a Galaxy 10.1 is a great deal for me.I've also rooted the device and disabled all the junk apps Samsung preinstalled it with
This has made the tablet run much faster
I've made sure to disable all the "KNOX" apps too.Battery life is pretty much amazing

It will last a whole day no doubt
If you don't get the case for it, the tablet doesn't do a good job of gripping to the surface you place it on

Even with the fake leather material on that back it still can slide off a surface that is at an incline


Easy fix if you just buy a case that has better friction.I've heard that a Galaxy note 12.2 edition is coming out next year, so you might want to hold off buying this if you want an even bigger screen, one that actually is the size of a piece of paper

This would be great to take notes on
Like I said, scrolling for me is not a problem with the 10.1 though.Design wise this thing is pretty nice
Even though it's mostly plastic, this allows for the tablet to be lighter.The people who complain about that lag are sort of right
It doesn't lag much but a few rare times I will see some stuttering
For people who complain about exiting apps being too slow, go to S Voice, go into Settings, and uncheck the box "Open via home key." Closing apps is slow because samsung is waiting for a double press on the homekey so that it can open S Voice

Once you disable that function exiting apps will be fast.I'll update in a few months to see how well this tablet does.Edit (after a few months)SNotes sucks, it lags and crashes


I've found a much better app, LectureNotes

Pretty much the same as SNOTES, but doesn't crash, and is supported heavily by the developer.The two touch buttons on the bottom of the screen is a real pain since you can accidentally touch them while writing
Solution? When using LectureNotes, rotate the tablet upside-down so that the you can't touch the buttons.Battery is still fantastic, a good pro for this device.Still using it heavily as a note taking device, has not failed
The pen has also still lasted me, no problems thus far.The 12.2 note did come out, go check it out on amazon and see if you should get it.Love this tablet to death, looks great


Dropped it once from 3 feet, didn't crack, but the corner got scratched.

$REVIEW.: I tried to purchase this from Logitech's site (which botched up my order) and ordered painlessly on Amazon Prime, hats off to Amazon again.It is a great, high quality physical keyboard for the Tab (works only with the Tab Wifi version only). I did not have problems with the sharp edges described by the previous reviewer - yes it is abit sharp on the sides but you are unlikely to impale yourself on it.Contrary to confusion on whether this keyboard only works with the portrait version of the Tab (as in the Amazon photo), it works with landscape and portrait orientations. All you do is to lift off the Tab, orient it whatever way you want and simply slide it at a slant into the groove on the keyboard. However, remember that nothing holds the Tab securely in the groove except gravity! So if in a car etc. it is possible for the Tab to jerk out if you hit a major hole...That said it is easy to lift the Tab off from the keyboard and use it in bed etc.Overall, keys are well spaced, have good tactile feel (abit softish but fine), don't wobble on the edges as some keys do in some other cheaper keyboards, are well integrated with the Tab ie there is a Home button, email and browser buttons etc. The cursor keys are at bottom right and work fine, though it would have been nice if they were abit larger. Keys are not backlit. The keyboard must be charged up separately from the Tab (a short USB wire is bundled to connect to any PC/Mac for charging and the charge is retained for like a week+....good).There are 2 buttons on the keyboard: one for ON/OFF of the keyboard itself, the other for Bluetooth ON/OFF. The keyboard connects seamlessly and in about 2 seconds with the Tab. Even if the keyboard is switched ON and Bluetooth is switched on (but you don't use the Tab for days), the keyboard's own battery seems to last for many days in this on mode...a week.The tab itself fits snugly face down into the keyboard when you are travelling, so the glass is protected and the overall keyboard and Tab are one slim unit. The rear of thee Tab however is not protected (ie the back). You can charge the Tab and have access to the charging port even when the Tab is packed face down into the keyboard.Overall highly recommended as probably the best Tab physical keyboard : a good 4.5 stars maybe more... It is much better than a previous soft black keyboard for a small Tab I purchased at 25% of the price, but it is abit too expensive at $99 odd... Should be say $60ish!

Just 7 days late and the warranty is significantly reduced. On to this card. I purchased this one because the MSI warranty and name is much better than the average card. This card installed into my existing PCI 2.0 Express x16 so it is backward compatible. Windows 7 found my card and the default drivers worked before I downloaded the latest drivers from MSI. When downloading the drivers, make sure you read the description of all of them since the UI does not make you choose OS, and 32 vs. 64 bits. Installation of the driver was easy. I play World of Warcraft, Star Wars, and D3 and I can turn the graphics up all the way and there are no issues. The card performs well. It uses less power than my previous card.

$REVIEW.: I have an iPad 2 and have wanted a Bluetooth keyboard for it. I settled on this one because of the positive reviews. I have not been disappointed. My first impression was that it is an almost exact copy of my iMac keyboard except made of black plastic. The size, weight and overall styling are remarkably similar. The plastic of this keyboard is thick and feels very sturdy. The key action is also very similar to the Apple one, which is comfortable for me. The HP paired easily with the iPad and is easily found again whenever I turn the keyboard off and back on. I haven't tested the Bluetooth range so far. I am very pleased with the functionality I get. If the iPad is asleep, I can tap twice on a keyboard button and the iPad awakens without me having to slide the onscreen "unlock" icon. The volume buttons on the keyboard control the volume setting on the iPad. (Brightness buttons do not work, however.) The music control buttons (start/ stop/ next/ previous) control music play even if the music app isn't turned on. It uses standard AA batteries, so I can use rechargeables and can take extras with me if I'm away from home. My one complaint is that the keyboard seems to go to low-power mode whenever I stop typing for a while. That means that when I type again, it takes a second to wake up and the first letter or two I type get missed. This is not enough of an issue to overshadow the positives I see in this peripheral.

$REVIEW.: The only minor issue I have with this mouse is that the buttons (left and right click) are a little harder to press than most... its hard to describe but you will notice how odd it feels. It by no means makes the mouse unusable but you will notice it slightly. Other than that the mouse performs above and beyond what i expected out of a 15$ mouse. I have paid up to 30 dollars for mice that were not even half the quality of this mouse. As for a gamer on a budget or someone like me who is only using it as a secondary gaming mouse for my laptop it is well worth the money.

$review_text.: I got this unit last week after doing research for more than 15 days


I moved from an old TomTom 300 to this latest gadget

I connected it to my computer and updated the software to latest version (not maps, maps are of Q3 2008).Here are the pros:First looks were very impressive and it took a while for me to understand it's features and options

Once I understood how it works, it's a breeze to operate and use

For the very first time I took it on road, it took almost 8 to 10 minutes to acquire a GPS signal and I thought it's a faulty unit

But once it picked up the 1st signal, it's very very fast


I switched it off and on several times and the signal is instant almost

Maps were accurate


It warns you several times before each turn and it knows exactly where you are on road

Highway lane guidence is excellent
It connected to my SonyEricsson phone and copied all contacts instantly

We even tried calling using bluetooth and voice clarity is not bad at all.Now some cons:The sound of speaker is not very loud and if your car sterio is on, you cannot almost hear the voice alerts (even in full speaker volume).Once in my 2 days of weekend usage, it guided me wrong.The screen is not very bright (may be because of our Arizona Sun :)).Other than these, I would recommend this unit to any one

This is the best out there in market for this price.-Sam.

They work readily with a Mac when one uses Time Machine.  I cannot stress enough that with Macs, one can generally have a better experience using Time Machine and not using the onboard Seagate software.These units keep getting smaller and run cooler and cooler.

$REVIEW.: I own theGarmin Forerunner 110, a GPS sports watch that has set the standard as to what this type of watch should do.  I've been poring over the differences and frankly, I think that Runtastic is going to give Garmin a run for the money.  Pun intended.  A lot of people are familiar with Runtastic via their apps:  Runtastic, Runtastic Road Bike, Walktastic, Runtastic Pedometer, Runtastic Mountain Bike, and Runtastic Winter Sports.  Each watch can be set up to record data via Garmin Connect or Runtastic Connect.  If you are working toward a particular goal like hitting that five minute mile you can check your progress and do things such as check out your route.There is a quick start guide included in the box, but you can find a 60-page manual online.  I'll put the link in the comments section.  When you have a cold start it's going to take a minute or more for satellite connection, but a warm start will get you up and running very quickly.  There are a few differences between the watches, but depending on what you want, things seem to equal out here.  The Garmin can be immersed in water while the Runtastic is only splash resistant.  If you're training for the Spartan Beast and are immersing yourself in a river to challenge yourself you might opt for the Garmin.  If you are a runner the choice is yours.The Runtastic has a compass and the Garmin doesn't.  Planning on working on your survivalist tactics, you might want the Runtastic if you're heading out into unknown terrain.  Bikers will be thrilled to note that the Runtastic comes with bike support.  When I did a quick review of the Garmin, I said something like it was as good as it gets.  Perhaps I spoke a bit too soon.  Price wise, this watch is less expensive.  Only time will tell as to how well this one performs over a longer period of time.  Using the Runtastic, playing with it, poring over the specs ... some advantages over the Garmin, a few detractors, but overall this is an awesome watch for the money.  I do think Garmin has a competitor.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  GPS Watch~  Sensor~  Chest Strap~  USB cable~  Bike Support (includes 2 cable clamps and 1 installing plate)~  Quick start guideCHARGING:Both the Garmin and Runtastic can be charged by plugging a USB cable into an AC adapter and plugging into a wall outlet.OS COMPATIBILITY:Garmin:  Windows/MacRuntastic:  Windows/MacBATTERY TYPE:Garmin:  200 mAh rechargeable, lithium-ion, coin-cell batteryRuntastic:  Lithium-polymer accumulator, 380 mAh, 3.7VBATTERY LIFE:Garmin:  Rechargeable, dependant on how much you use it.

$review_text.: I can understand the need to make some cuts in a budget tablet and could live with no flash for the camera. But haptic feedback (vibration alerts) is an integral feature in all versions of Android and one we expect the hardware to support. Of all things, why would Asus leave this out? And this is not always spelled out in the specs, so you have to go beyond the specs and research each individual feature that you assume is there for any tablet you want to buy. Lack of haptic feedback on this tablet is a complete disqualification as far as I am concerned. Same with the Dell Venue 8.UPDATE: had to change from 2 stars to 3 to be fair. It seems most other manufacturers are leaving haptic feedback off of all but very premium tablets. Even the new Galaxy Tab PRO 8.4 does not have it. You have to buy the $500 Pro 10.1 or the Note 10.1 to get haptic feedback. My 2 year old GT 7 Plus has it, and I have come to depend on it for notifications I would miss otherwise. I still think leaving it out is a poor economy no matter how many manufacturers are doing it.

$review_text.: I bought this camera to replace a nearly five-year-old Olympus D-460Z and I am quite impressed with it overall.My main criteria were high zoom and low shot-to-shot delay, and the PowerShot S1 IS satisfies both criteria extremely well...and more. It has controls for every aspect of picture-taking that I could ever want to adjust. The commonly used functions are usually only a button press or two away rather than buried in the menu system.The movie mode is quite useful rather than just a gimmick. I can definitely see myself leaving my camcorder at home in situations where movie-taking opportunities will be few and far between.My D-460Z supports alignment guides for panoramas (when using Olympus-branded flash cards), but I'm blown away by the PowerShot S1 IS's "Stitch Assist" implementation. For every shot after the first, you are presented with a dimmed version of the overlapping one-third of the previous shot with which to align your next shot.I really like that this camera uses standard AA cells. It will save me a fortune on extra battery sets vs. the Li-ion batteries used in several other digicams.I wish Canon had opted for a USB 2.0 or Firewire interface because the files -- movies, especially -- take forever to download over USB 1.1. This fact did not detract from my rating because I find the workaround to be perfectly acceptable: a USB 2.0 or Firewire CompactFlash reader.I do have a couple of nit-picky focus-related complaints. First of all, I find the autofocus to be very problematic in incandescent room light, which leads to many out-of-focus shots because even the manual focus is difficult to use in that light. Also, it's very awkward to use the manual focus with the electronic viewfinder due to the placement of the omni control; I wish they had put the manual focus up/down controls more toward the front of the camera.

$REVIEW.: I have gone through at least 20 pair of headphone looking for a quality set the I could use for workouts and on frequent plane rides.  For a few years I was happy with the Sony MDR-EX71.  The spilt line and offset wire design was great!  But the build quality and sound quality just didn't cut it.  After replacing them 3 times for the same connection failure I bit the bullet and spend some extra money on the Shure headphones.  I was not disappointed.These are incredibly comfortable.  I use the medium foam tips.  The block out most other sound and hold in place very well.  For workouts I have never had a problem with them tugging off like most headphones.  I would still prefer an offset cord.  The double cord under the chin is not very comfortable.Sound quality is balanced.  If you are used to lower end headphones that are biased for more bass, these will take some time to get used to.  But you will recognize the clarity improvements immediately.The most striking feature on these headphones is their build quality.  The cords are thick but flexible.  They have very well designed strain reliefs the input jack and Y-connection, which many other manufacturers neglect.  The rod to headphone connection is strong.  I love that the design allows for you to replace a worn set of cords without having to throw out the expensive drivers.  Why are all headphone not made this way?  Oh, right....these cost 6 times the amount my last set did.  Worth it.

$REVIEW.: this is okay if you keep your expectations in check.  I have to say I am bit surprised based on all the hugely positive reviews-  Build quality seems very good.  I haven't had it that long though-  Looks nice-  Pretty portable for the size speaker it is.  I can easily take this outside-  Sound is average at best.  Very boomy base, very weak highs and mids.  and truth be told I like a lot of bass but this is really overpowering.  It does go very loud.I wouldn't consider this anywhere near $300.  I paid much less for it.  I will keep it because I am most interested in using it outside.  the volume makes it a keeper for me.  if I used it indoors I wouldn't keep it.  Of all the speakers I have personally heard I would choose the bose in this price range.  This has to be middle of the pack in the $400 price range

$review_text.: After reading numerous positive reviews about this product, I decided to buy this cheap HDMI cable for my HDTV.  However, after only 5 weeks of use, we started to get audio problems (silence for a few seconds every 3 minutes or so) and then finally it would no longer send the signal from my HD DVR cable box in any resolution higher than standard, i.e. NO HD.  After resetting the signal and troubleshooting the DVR, the DVD player and the HDTV, I spent hours trying to figure out how to resolve the problem adjusting all the settings.Then the time warner customer service suggested swapping out the HDMI cable.  I did and the 1080p picture returned!This HDMI cable failed in less than 5 weeks of moderate use, i.e. less than 3 hours per day.  Because it is no longer returnable and not worth it under existing policy, this cable will now have to be sent to help fill some landfill somewhere further polluting the environment.A few of my friends warned me about purchasing a cheap HDMI cable, but I was influenced by all the positive feedback for this product.  It is strange that so many people have recommended this product but I wonder if their opinion has changed after a few months.It is possible that I just got a dud, but each of you will have to decide whether you want to take a chance on this cheap cable for your expensive HDTV.Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray

$review_text.: This little keyboard is perfect for tight spaces and portability. It not only has a very small foot-print, but is also light weight and quiet. I use it with a flight simulator and it is perfect for that especially since I have very limited desk-top space for it there. It is only used briefly and intermittently in that application and usually only a single hunt-and-peck key at a time. On the other hand it is not my preference for touch-typing, heavy or continuous use as the keys are not contoured and their separation is minimal and vague to the touch. That's why it ended up on the flight simulator and not on my main working computer.

$REVIEW.: I'm using these Toslink cables for an 8-channel ADAT digital audio link between my Tascam DA-88 and Akai DPS24 digital audio workstation.  The cables are quite nice -- all individually wrapped in plastic.  They look just like a Toslink cable, and work without problems.  I have 4 times the digital audio data as a typical stereo system.  I just pluggedd them in and they worked.Most Toslink connections are stereo SPDIF, but if you are looking to connect your 8-channel ADAT equipment together or maybe like I was, to connect you ADAT gear to your Akai MPLP (multi-purpose light pipe), THIS CABLE WILL WORK and does not cost a ton of money.Seems like I'm mostly paying for shipping, but that's OK.  Shipping was less than it would cost me to drive to Best Buy, where I would have the privilege of paying TEN times as much (total cost). I bought 4 because they were so reasonably priced.  Still cost me less then I would have paid for one at Best Buy.  I'll be replacing some of my wired coax connectors with the optical ones.

$review_text.: After following all the instrucitos I could find, including what other reviews have submitted, I cannot get this item to work.I WAS able to get the sound to come through my television (I tried it on 2 different TV's).  The video output on the iPods were set to TV, as well as the video type.  I tried every combination I could find, best I could get was sound only.  This was tried with my wifes iPod Touch, my iPod Touch, and my sons iPod Nano which has video capability.With the iPod Touch's, I got sound but no video.  With the Nano (newest version purchased 3/2010), I got an message saying to connect output device, then an error on the iPod saying "Output Device Not Supported."Unfortunately, it simply appears that this product DOES NOT work with newer iPod products, or at least not all of them.  I am very tech saavy and could not get it to function properly, I even looked though dozens of reviews here that say how they got it to work, with no luck.  I am currently awaiting my refund for this product.

$REVIEW.: This fan probably saved my laptop! My laptop started heating up, I mean really heating up
To the point I couldn't touch the bottom or even the top
While doing intensive graphic work the thing would just time out and shut down on me because it was over heating that much

I knew I had to do something fast before things started melting


So I began the long search of looking for a laptop cooler...apparently it's been awhile since I've priced these puppies out as they've certainly increased! I thought about going for a cheap version, but remembered the last time I did that it broke in less than two days
Suddenly the thought, "You get what you pay for" popped into my head
I couldn't go cheap


I needed something to cool my laptop down fast


Which brings me to the Cool Master Storm SF 19, and my initial reaction of, $55!!!!!! Am I nuts! I was going to opt for the lesser expensiveCooler Master Notepal X2 Notebook Cooler R9-NBC-4WAK-GP, but after reading the reviews for the SF 19 I knew this was the product I needed


So, I closed my eyes and hit add to cart
It arrived in no time thanks to Amazon Prime


I opened it up and couldn't believe how big it was


Let's just say it's not compact or built for travel


Given that, I can honestly say IT WORKS!!This was the best purchase decision I've ever made
The Cool Master SF 19 is like air conditioning for my laptop
No more overheating
My laptop stays cool and comfy


I can even touch it again! I also like the fact I can throttle the fan speed

I keep it low for most of the day, and then crank it up when working with graphics or video


The fan is a bit loud, sounds like a wind tunnel when turned up high, but I really don't care

The noise doesn't bother me that much, and I'm just glad it works and it's not all noise like most fans are

The ambient lights are neat too, and act as a nice night light in the office
The tilt angle of the fan is just right, and allows me to use my computer comfortably without my wrists getting bent out of shape

The rubber grips and very grippy and keep my laptop securely on the base with no slippage.If you're having problems with overheating, and don't want to see your expensive, fully-decked out laptop become a melted paper weight...buy this cooler


You won't regret it.

I really dislike pulling my PC out and disconnecting one USB cable to swap it for another.

But I just finished using it for the 40th time, after which it is recommended that you buy a new one, and all the players/burners I've used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didn't periodically clean them is impossible to say.The disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipment's lens. It takes about one minute. There are also some additional features which I have never used.

$REVIEW.: Ive had this laptop for about a year and a half using it almost every day mostly for college/youtube/ internet searching.Everything still works like normal still decently fast for a computer this cheap and for the specs

 I can download different items without trouble


 I dont know why this product is rated so low since its defiantly paid off for me

 DVD player works as well as the cd player

I had trouble with the dvd drive once with one dvd thats it

 Mostly using it for internet searching has worked well

 I have also taken it many places in my backback  with it on being tossed around and still works fine

 There are better laptops but not for the price nice led screen and keyboard is layed out nicely  the only thing i dont like it that the shift and enter key are a tiny bit smaller but thats not a big deal

 downloads off the internet are no problem

 4 usb ports  are awesome as well


 If i had to be really critical on this laptop i would say the volume isnt too loud (but what laptop really is)and the spacebar has to be pressed in the middle most the time but no big deal cause  you do that anyways.Like i said for your basic internet usage and document typing  this is a perfect laptop for the money.

$review_text.: I'm a fan of wide angled photography and this super wide angle Tokina lens is a great piece to have for those looking for a good quality super wide angle at a very decent price. When compared with the Canon 10 - 20mm, I found this to be a better buy as it's a F/2.8 vs the canon which is an F/3.5 - 4.5 as I prefer a F/2.8 vs a broader zoom range.Pros:1) Excellent quality (F/2.8), no significant distortion around the edges at the widest angle2) Good price3) Quality build - mostly metal body4) Lens hood included in package.Cons:1) A bit heavy (comes with the solid body) so it can be a bit heavy to take on hikes especially if you take a lot of gear with you.2) I personally feel that AF is a bit slow but it doesn't seem to be a big concern with most others.Overall, it's a great lens, so do give it a go if you are looking for an ultra wide.

$review_text.: I have been taking pictures with Canons early digital as well as the the latest models.  I use every setting from full manual to auto depending upon the condition I meet.  I read up on all the materials presented with each camera and from my 20D, 40D, T2i and T4i I've gone through many lenses and settings.  I never wanted another high end brand but I have used Nikon, Olympus, Sony and Panasonic in various applications.  The main camera system I use other than Canon is Fuji, which has high quality mid range cameras.To sum it up since there are so many highly detailed reviews and specifics this camera captures perfect details in every image I take.  I wanted a camera to grow with my needs and really give me an edge since I'm not very high on the professional realm of picture taking.  With this system I was given the most bang for my buck.  A great photographer can take excellent images with just about any camera, I on the other hand need some help and this camera makes many images look professional.  I have several lenses that I've kept from the previous cameras and have not had any issues with zoom, macro, kit or telephoto lenses.  You will not be dissapointed when you hold this camera in your hands.  It's a piece of art ready to explode onto paper your imagination captures in digital format!Highly recommended! Keep up the great work Canon!

The build quality is obvious and the cable performs flawlessly. Highly recommended.My only criticism/suggestion would apply to pretty much all monitor cables, VGA or DVI: the screws are never quite long enough to comfortable tighten with my fingers, so a screwdriver is usually needed. Fortunately this cable can be tightened with a phillips or flat head screwdriver.

$review_text.: Samsung DVD-VR375 Review 7/15/10I bought this unit in June 2009 in spite of mixed reviews. Initially I had some problems with the image and sound being out of synch. I called Samsung tech support and got a good technician who told me how to "reset" the unit. (In case this can help a reader: Turn the unit on without a disc in it and wait until it says "load" and then "no disc." Press and hold both the channel [CH] up and channel [CH] down buttons simultaneously for ten seconds. When this is done, the device will open the disc tray and the word "reset" should appear. Turn the unit off and wait at least ten seconds before trying to do dubbing.) This seemed to help the problem. I only used the unit a few times at the time and it remained unused until recently.Over the past month I resumed use of the dubber and copied several videos to DVD. While some copied OK, several had the same out of synch problem as before. Resetting the model had not effect. I called tech support and was told to download firmware from the Samsung website and put that on a CD and put the CD in the player. The player would upload the firmware and the problem would be fixed. The firmware downloads as a zip file and at first I put that on a CD or DVD and put it in the player but it would not recognize it. I called Samsung back and was told you need to "extract" the zip file (open it up) and put that into the Samsung. I tried that to no avail. Then I called them a third time and was told it had to be in an ISO format. I had a techie friend prepare that onto a CD and I tried that to no avail. At that point, I gave up on the unit. It is too bad. It seems to work OK as a DVD and video player (although I did not generally use it for that purpose) and when it dubbed well, it was great.As for Samsung tech support, I love being able to talk with a human being fairly quickly. However, with this unit and other items, most of my experiences have been poor - either I have not been given enough information or, in one case with a TV question, the information was inaccurate. In general, I think Samsung is one of the best brands.To meet my video to DVD dubbing needs, after studying different options I ordered from an Amazon merchant the Toshiba DKR40 DVD recorder with 1080p upconversion. It does a fine job of copying from an external VHS player (of which I have several) and is very easy to use in this context. (Among other things, it also has a timer for copying TV programs onto DVD, a feature that reviewers have mixed results with - either due to the user or the recorder.) It only costs $89 (as of June 2010), with free s/h. Even if only the dubbing feature works, that is a really good price. My only concern was that it only had a few reviews to read so far. I decided to go this route because the combo DVD/VHS dubbing units, that were under $200, seemed to got mixed reviews.There is a newer model of the DVD-VR375, the DVD-VR375/DVD-VR375A. Presumably the newer model has the upgrade I was unable to load onto mine. If you are considering buying the newer model, you might call Samsung first to be sure of this [1-800-726-7864]. Hopefully you'll get a knowledgeable support person.As for the Samsung DVD-VR375, I don't recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Hell for bad engineering would require the designers to operate the equipment they designed poorly for eternity.  For the Belkin TuneCast II, the engineer would drive from city to city and have to keep using this device to listen to the iPod.Looks good in the blister pack, but neither well-engineered nor well-manufactured.  First one I bought wouldn't turn on.  The second one worked except that it's autostart feature when the iPod audio started never worked and the batteries seemed to run down while switched off (both auto-off and auto-on were advertised features).The reason I'm returning it though relates to safety on a trip.  To get it working in the car involves too much fiddling:  plug power into lighter, power into iPod, transmitter into iPod, press both tuning bottons at once to turn it on and hope it stays on while one finds a clear channel on the FM radio (which changes during a trip), press the mem button twice to store in memory, start iPod playback, move transmitter as close a possible to radio for stronger signal, etc.  Too much fiddling required.

$REVIEW.: Like so many others, I've been researching large-screen televisions for quite a while, reading countless reviews and repeatedly visiting stores to compare the various sets.  And also like many others, I decided against large box CRTs, plasma and DLP sets for well-known reasons (at least among people who have researched these competing technologies) and in favor of LCD technology.I then determined what features would be appropriate for my viewing habits (mostly movies), what price I was able to afford and finally, which brand and model to select.  While I checked out the usual suspects (Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, JVC, Sharp, Panasonic) and a few `orphan' brands (Westinghouse, Olevia, Vizio) I finally came down decisively on the Samsung.  There's a very good reason why they've come to dominate the market.I intended to order a particular Samsung model (the LNS 4041D) from Amazon, as they seemed to have the best price, and buyers' feedback on delivery was generally very positive (I had just ordered an Oppo DV-970HD upconverting DVD player from Amazon a week ago and was anxious to get the TV now).  Before ordering, however, I went to both of the big name stores (BB and CC).  BB had that set listed for $1,299, but it was not in stock.  I went to nearby CC, thinking they might have it and match the price.  They did not have it, but had the newer 4051D in stock for...$1,299 (with 2 HDMI connections, 4,000 to 1 contrast ratio and lots more).  I went to purchase it and found that there was a `promotional special' in effect by Samsung, which was an incredible deal.  I bought the LNS-4051D, 40" LCD set, plus custom Firedog wall mounting installation (regular $299), plus high quality wall mounting brackets (regular $204), plus tax for a grand total of $1,156!  Sorry, Amazon.It took about an hour to move my other TV (a 32" JVC, quite heavy), disconnect some components and connect the Oppo (which came with a gold-plated HDMI cord).  Out of the box and connected to standard definition satellite signals, the image wasn't impressive.  However, a few minutes of easy tweaking brought the image closer to that of the JVC.  The high resolution of the Samsung definitely brings out the limitations of standard broadcast signals, but it still looks as good as analog CRTs (especially when changing the picture size to 4:3 ratio).  After viewing regular SD programming for a while, I put into the Oppo the widescreen Steven Spielberg remake of `War of the Worlds', tweaked the settings a bit more and beheld.  Wow.  The upconversion brought the quality of this 480p disc to near HD quality.  The difference between the Samsung and the JVC CRT set was immediate and pronounced.  It was almost like watching the film for the first time.  I then put on `Roxy Music Live from the Apollo'.  With my Yamaha receiver set on DTS and the surround volume cranked up, it nearly blew me into next week.  I've watched that concert several times, but once it was displayed upconverted to the Samsung, it was like being there in person.  Simply stunning.While it remains to be seen what my reaction will be to real HD signals, I can safely assume that it will be even more jubilance (and when prices drop in half, a HD DVD player will be on the menu).  So far, I could not be more pleased with the purchase.  It is also worth noting that the gloss piano black finish makes this unit look like a veritable work of art.  Some have complained about it, probably due to it attracting dust.  This may be true, but included with the set are soft clothes designed for cleaning the bezel and back of the set.  Since my surround speaker system is NHT that are finished in gloss piano black, the whole setup looks fantastic.  After cutting the system off for the night, I just sat there admiring it for a while, before going to bed and dreaming of high definition viewing yet to come.  I am very, very pleased with this great television
$SUMMARY.: After months of research, the winner is...Samsung LNS- 4051D!

$review_text.: I purchased this to go along with me on a backpacking trip, for the time when I really could use a good tripod. It's short enough it can fit in any pack, but it extends far enough that I barely have to bend down to look through my DSLR viewfinder. I'm 6'3, and I might bend down an inch.My two favorite features are the monopod conversion, which makes this worth that much more, and the leg extension locks. However it is designed, the twist locks on the legs work regardless if the one above is locked or not. This means that you can, one handed, loosen all the joints, pull the leg out by the end, and move up the leg, tightening the locks one by one from the bottom up, unlike a lot of tripods. This makes it very fast to pull out and set up.The whole thing is very solid and super adjustable. The ball head is smooth and tight, and the quick release is nice. It's not as quick as it could be, though, because you screw in a little knob to anchor it, rather than a lever. Also, the plate that connects to the camera could use some extra markings. One side has a little white line you can line up on the tripod to get it centered, the opposite side has a bubble level, which is nice, BUT you can only really use one or the other on a DSLR, and you have to screw it to the body what would amount to sideways, off by 90 degrees. Either you have the level or the white line directly under the lens, if it's visible at all. My other complaint is weight, but all things considered, it's pretty good without going for carbon fiber, which would triple the price.

Compared to the Pogo:Pros-Thicker stylus, making it more comfortable to write with-Sturdy rubber tip allows for faster and more precise writing over the pogo's malleable foam tip-PrettierCons-PriceThe blue color is just a touch lighter than what's depicted, but I actually like the real color better. I'm really most impressed by how fast I can write on the iPad with this stylus. There was a noticeable lag with the Pogo and it wasn't as clean looking. So despite the price, if i had to go back and make my decision over, I'd go with the BoxWave 100%.UPDATE:I've been using the stylus for a couple months now. Still works great!

$review_text.: After receiving this item promptly from Bombay Electronics, I noticed something which caused me to do a fair amount of internet research and then to finally contact OREI for clarification


The response from OREI was troubling to me
 The issue is that this adapter allows a two-pronged, polarized plug to be plugged into the adapter with the neutral side of the plug connected to either the line voltage or neutral side of the mains voltage
 In other words, the adapter is not polarity sensitive
 Plugging a 3-pronged plug into this adapter connects the neutral side of the plug to the terminal on the adapter marked "L" which one would reasonably believe to be the line or voltage side of the plug
 Either the adapter is marked incorrectly or this is the reverse of what it should be and apparently puts line voltage on the neutral side of any 3-pronged appliance.My wife just came back from Ireland and used this adapter to charge her camera battery
Since her camera battery charger is not polarity sensitive there was no safety concern
 However, she did not use her hair dryer which has a 2-pronged polarized plug because of safety concerns


 OREI glossed over my question with a generic response

They need to redesign this product and make it polarity sensitive (allow polarized plugs to be plugged in only one way, the proper way) and confirm that their markings are correct on the adapter..


$SUMMARY.: Bombay Electronics was prompt in shipping but, product is questionable.

$REVIEW.: I'm a nerd, all the way.  I have more gadgets around my house than I should.  I like the most complex devices with big instruction manuals.  I have huge amount of patience and love to figure out problems.  With all that said,  I really think these car stereos should be much better.  I've read some of the reviews,  you guys like the features and I think from reading the reviews,  you guys have purchased other units and think this unit is of good quality.  But really I think car stereos should be so much better, especially for $1000.I got this unit installed in a new Jeep Wrangler I purchased,  and I have a similar one in my RV.  You turn this thing on, and it asks you to create a user account, you try and it fails since there is no net connection.  OK,  so you go connect the WIFI and try again... only to fail since it says "service not available".  OK, so now time to figure out the model number,  and do some research.  You go to the menus,  Help- About etc,  it comes up with a DNN 2013..  so you search on the Internet,  nope.. nothing for that.  OK,  so now break out the docs and hopefully it has a manual in there.. yep it does.  OK so now I know the model number.  I go to their website,  any manual?  no..  ok back to the docs,  it has a CD,  ok put the CD in.. read through some pages.  AHH ok it's a online service "ROUTE-COLLECTOR",  and it wants all your info.  OK WHATEVER,  so you give them their info and create an account Online at ROUTE-COLLECTOR.com,  go back to the Jeep,  now try the login and pass you created on the website..  AHHH ok AUTO LOGIN,  now you are cured of 4 button pushes everytime you enter the vehicle.Really?  what a joke,  and what poor planning.  Did my car salesman know anything about this?  no.. not a clue.  Could the dealership make it easier for their customers,  sure they could.. they don't though.  All this BS for some service that's not going to work unless you have a WIFI connection when you drive (for the most part).Here are some more things I don't like,  no volume dial.. I can do it from my steering wheel,  but hey it would be nice to have a real dial on the screen.The screen moves from one to another like it's working off a 486 processor,  what is the engine behind this thing?Intuitive back end - NOT,  not even the power button is that intuitive (hold down the home button).Kenwood and others could learn alot from Apple.. and Apple should break into the car stereo business.

I'm not an audio expert so to my ears, they were pretty good too.  However just recently the new PX 100-II lost sound in one earpiece.  I just found that others here have had the same experience with this headphone.  This is indicative of lowered manufacturing quality from Sennheiser.  I'm pretty careful with my headphones, and I never really yanked the wire hard by accident.  It seems that it died due to normal every day use after 1 year.  Fortunately, Sennheiser has a 2 year warranty so I'm going to try to get a replacement, but still, I have lost my faith in Sennheiser.

The sound is clear, the solar charger keeps the unit powered for my minimal use.  I have tested it with charging my HTC Thunderbolt cell phone and it will charge it to half power easily.  The flashlight works well also.  Today I went to turn the radio on while I was doing dishes, first time in a few days as I have been busy with holiday duties.  The radio was dead.  The charger wouldn't work.  I was fairly pissed and pulled out the instructions to see what the warranty was.  Glancing through the user manual while looking for the warranty I came across troubleshooting section and found where for my specific issue they recommended taking out the battery and hitting a reset button with a paper clip.  Bingo!  My radio is back on the kitchen window, charging.  I decided to order a second unit right then and there.  Great radio and a great price.

$REVIEW.: I took the non-kit route and bought a house and this lens separately. After weeks of searching the web and reading far too many reviews for the perfect all-purpose lens, I couldn't resist the range and price of this lens. An 18-270mm at this price and with such good reviews was hard to pass up. The photos have been phenomenal and the VC (vibration compensation) works better than expected. Aside from a stiff zoom range that has subsided with usage and the occasional lens creep that can be prevented with a lens lock, this lens has been the jewel I'd hoped for and has delivered.

$REVIEW.: When I opened the shipping box, I immediately thought "what in the world."  This speaker is TINY - a bit larger than the palm of my hand.  So I was prepared not to like it.  I can now honestly report that my initial misgivings were unfounded - this speaker rocks!The packaging of the speaker itself is almost "Apple like."  A simple box, a speaker and inside, a micro USB cable and an extremely simple setup guide.  The guide itself couldn't be easier - it's all pictures and involves all of 3 steps - turn on device, link with Bluetooth, and play music.  How nice - setup is a breeze!  The micro USB cable even makes sense if you think about it - much smaller than an AC adapter, ensuring that the speaker itself is really portable.  The speaker itself has 4 buttons +, -, bluetooth synch, and on/off.  Simple to use, and from opening the box to hearing it play music took only seconds.Because this is a Bluetooth device, there's no docking station.  True portability.Turning to the most important part - the sound, I was very surprised by the quality given its small size.  You can blast this speaker without distortion, and the sound can fill a decent-sized room easily.  I'll freely admit - this speaker is tiny, and as a result, it lacks base sound at higher volumes, but the sound is still quite good.  In fact, other than the base sound at high volumes, the sound is comparable to our Bose Soundlink speakers.  And of course, this speaker is much smaller in size.I haven't tested the speaker's battery life to see if it lasts the full claimed 10 hours.  However, I have played this speaker for 5-6 hours with no need to charge it.In all, I'd highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a high-quality, portable device.  The age of the boom box is officially over!

$REVIEW.: This Kingston Digital Flash Card performs just as well as one would anticipate and is ideal for use in camcorders and video cameras. I put mine in my GoPro camera with absolutely seamless and fluid video as a result. That is not a surprise. What needs to be stressed is that this review will appear for both the Frustration Free and the Regular packing. MAKE CERTAIN YOU GET THE FRUSTRATION FREE VERSION!!! The difference in price - at least as of today - is absolutely shocking, The Frustration Free version is today a third of the price of the Regular packaging - just under $10 compared to $33. The price will fluctuate over time, but the Frustration Free version will consistently beat the price of the Regular. So make sure you save yourself some money while guaranteeing that you have an outstanding flash card.

$REVIEW.: I have owned two walkmans prior to buying this third one


 The first two were higher model numbers with more features
 I guess because the yen has lost value their products are more expensive now
So I ended up buying this model

I use my Walkman for motorcycle ride music.And no it does not take pictures

 My last two Walkman lasted about 16 months before dying, hence the 1 year limited warrantee.The features you do not get that are on the higher priced Walkman are:Record FM music.Speakerslarger screen with better resolution.What I like about this model:Smaller by about 1/3.PriceWhat it has that you may not know:Equalizer for music only not radio with customs settingsTip:  As on review has stated about playlists, yes it does but you need to create a playlist in Windows media player then copy into folder on Walkman.

$review_text.: This pair of speakers is a treasure to keep. The sound image and stages are so accurate, they put my POLK Audio TSi6 to shame. They are not very efficient, so give them a little juice, and they will perform beautifully. I hooked them up with SONY STR-915 receiver and a POLK Audio PSW10 subwoofer, and did a quick comparison between the Polk and Micca using the A/B speaker selection, the differences were obvious. The Polk appears muddy with male vocal, however, it is crystal clear from Micca. What a joy to listen to them. Like Crammer said on Mad Money: &#34;Buy! Buy! Buy!&#34;. I am saying that too to all of you, who are out there with hesitation and indecision.

$review_text.: I was dealing with bad insomnia for the past few months, and my efforts to wake earlier (so I'd be tired enough to sleep earlier) were not helped by me constantly sleeping through my alarm. I was looking for a clock with a few specific functions: 1. It had to have a gradual wake feature, as the shock from normal alarm clocks always left me groggy in the morning, 2. It had to be able to use some kind of nature sound as the alarm, simply because it's more pleasant to wake up to those than it is to a beep, and 3. It had to be lit with cool blue LED lights, because this is less jarring to look at at night, and the blue is more soothing to look at than the normal red LEDs, which just look ugly to me.It was really impressed with how many sounds there were on the clock (20), I didn't expect it to have that many. I've never heard the earlier model so I can't comment if the clarity was better with those, but the sounds are fine to use as an alarm. They are definitely not clear enough to use as a sound machine or sound soother; there is a lot of noise, like the sounds were recorded through a cheap microphone, or possibly the speakers are cheap. But since I did not buy the alarm clock to listen to, and just use it as an alarm, it personally did not matter to me.Some of the sounds are also pretty clear. I like to use the wind chimes sound as my alarm, since it's a gentle way to wake up, and the sound clarity is better than some of the other sounds like the ocean or the brook.It's very easy and straightforward to navigate the clock menus and set up the alarm. You can also program 2 alarms, which is a nice bonus! And you can set each alarm to go off everyday, every weekday, or every weekend day. I was impressed with how many features the clock was programmed with.My insomnia is also a lot better now, and this clock looks great on my blue desk! It had an unobtrusive yet slick and modern design, and the numbers have 3 levels of brightness that are all aesthetically pleasing. There is also a daylight savings time button on the back of the clock, so you can adjust that with the flick of a finger instead of programming it through the clock buttons manually.I am happy with my purchase and glad I bought it despite the negative reviews. :) There really wasn't any other alarm clock on Amazon that fit my criteria, and if they did they cost over $100 and there was no way I was paying that much for an alarm clock, so I'm relieved that the one clock that is reasonably priced turned out to be better than what I had been expecting.

I like the fact that no one can cut it off your neck in crowds. The loop is thick so you feel your camera is protected from dropping and that's what I was looking for.

$REVIEW.: Tamrac 5585 or Expedition 5X is the perfect choice for me to hold all of my current photography gear

The size of this one is perfect to hold my camera body when mounted to my 6 3/4 inch zoom-telephoto lens
I still have length beyond the end of this lens to hold my battery charger within a separate compartment


All of the features of the bag are well thought out
It is very comfortable to wear even when fully loaded


I wished it had a full cover for rain, but I do not think I will be shooting in a downpour anyway


For someone who wanted to store two camera bodies mounted with lenses, then they should select at least the Expedition 6X or even larger
Tamrac makes wonderful products.

$review_text.: The case does have an interesting smell when you first take it out of the plastic wrapping, but it goes away shortly thereafter.  I use my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for games, movies, reading, internet, music and office document editing.The case allows you to easily hold onto the device with one one through the strap on the inside of the one of the case flaps.  It is elastic so for right now it is holds on tight to my hand, but I am sure that overtime the elasticity of it will go away.  This is great for reading on doing things with the Kindle in portrait mode.  However, It can be troublesome to use it with your left had as the strap is on the right half of the case but it is not a deal breaker in my opinion.Once you put the device in the case, it is very secure in it.  I do not see any wiggle from the device while shaking it. The case does allow you to view the device in landscape mode with three separate angles.  To get it to do that, you just pop the device out of the bottom corner tabs and the case loosens to allow you to select your angle.The speakers on the device are covered when you have the flap on the back of the device, but the case does have perforated areas near the speaker locations.  The sound does come out fine, but it does sound a little bit muffled.  However, if you want to listen to music or watch a video, it is a lot better in landscape mode and the speakers are then uncovered.  Also, having the case where it is located in landscape mode allows the speakers to be somewhat wrapped as if you had your hand there shooting the sound back to you.The speaker allows you the easily charge your device in the open or closed position so long as it is not in landscape mode as the hookups are blocked.  The headphone jack is not blocked at all and neither are the power or volume buttons.  However, it can be a little difficult to press the up at times.There is a hoop on the side of the case that allows you to attach a stylus.  I have an Amazon Basics stylus and it fits it well.Overall, I would recommend this case as it is cheap (got the black for $12), appears to be built well and is quite functional.

$REVIEW.: The benefits of an extra battery are obvious, so I won't bother telling you why to buy one
OEM batteries are the way to go I say

Sure, you pay a premium, but they work right and you know they will be compatible


I noticed some users saying the OEM batteries do not last very long, but having used these in 2 different cameras, an EP-2 and an EPM-1, my experience is that the camera makes an enormous difference
The EP-2 would not last long, but the same battery seems to last forever in the EPM-1, so just consider that as a factor


What else can I say..

it's a battery, it's well made, and it is awesome to have when your camera dies in the middle of an outing!

$review_text.: I just bought this router refurbished from linksys to upgrade from my WRTG54 (which I believe was one of the best routers of all time), and it came in a box like it was brand new. The packaging would make you swear it was bought off a store shelf brand new. It was clean, scratch free, and finger print free. The router itself had a clear protective plastic cover adhered to the surface, and the Ethernet cable was wrapped and twist tied twice.Now it says on the box to run the disc before hooking up cables, this isn't true. If you connect your modem directly to the router, you'll have internet access within seconds. The disc does help with initial setup, but I've been setup routers and networks for years, so I just went straight to the control panel in my browser. To access the control panel, just go to your favorite web browser and type 192.168.1.1 That's the default gateway to the router's preference panel. If it asks for a username and password, just type "admin" for both, without the quotation marks.Over all, this router is fast! I was able to transfer large files between computers on my network at blazing fast speeds. With the power of wireless N now, the range and coverage of the wifi is a lot greater. I was able to get WiFi in rooms of the house I wasn't able to before. Rooms that had low signals now show full bars and a strong signal.Design was, the body has been slimmed down and made a sexy glossy black. The new icons and blue LED display on the top of the router is also a nice new refresh. The router is also lacking external antennas which is also nice, dont have to worry about those getting whacked into weird directions and positions by the cat anymore.I also liked the refreshed GUI of the settings. They're nearly identical to the layout of the WRTG54G, but made a bit more simpler and friendlier for those new to playing with the settings of their router.Definitely recommend the refurbished model over the new one!

This is great for the gym or a young child who isn't old enough to have a super expensive iPod.I like the FM radio option and the clarity was really good. The overall sound of this small mp3 player was surprisingly good. I did find that scrolling thru the menu's to get to mp3, video, photos, FM were a bit weird.So why is there no mac support? well you can actually load music on it as if it was a usb drive but its clearly not geared for mac, only windows. This isn't for someone who has or had an iPod because they won't like it but for a young kid or to have something inexpensive to travel or take to the gym its perfect. I wouldn't be worried if I dropped it, its light and I don't think it would break like an iPod would.The biggest perk about this is the FM radio.

$review_text.: I purchased this camera for my wife to replace a Canon that was too big to fit her purse - the Canon was great, but a bit bulky. Here's what we think of the camera so far:Pros:- Outdoor daytime pictures are stunning! Colors are bright and faithful to real-life and white balance is good at factory settings.- Large LCD screen with auto brightness in any lighting is a big plus. We never have trouble seeing the screen, even in bright light.- For such a small, purse-sized camera, we think it is plenty sturdy - just be sure to use the wrist strap, because it is easier to drop by nature of it's size - that's just basic physics!Cons:- Flash photography is just average - and the camera is pretty slow in very low light, even with flash.- Battery life is just average. You should get an extra battery - if you do, I would get a name brand, as generics don't hold charge and won't last as long as your original.Overall, for our use, we love this camera! We just wish it was a bit faster in low light and had a longer-lasting battery. Still, we highly recommend!

$review_text.: The iPod Touch...this device is amazing

 I have had a while to play with all the features and I have to say that it is a powerhouse
 I love all the different things you can do with it


 You can use the Safari browser to surf the web in either a portrait style mode or in widescreen

 The YouTube application allows you to watch any video on youtube on your iPod Touch


 The Weather App continuously recieved updates on any city where weather reporting is possible

 The Maps App allows you to find directions for any to and from situation

 You can even pinpoint your approximate location using your wireless connection

 There are many other apps that are very useful and make the iTouch seem like a PDA when it really is considered a media player
 You can even check your email on it as long as there is a compatible connection

 Also, if you go to the apple site on your iTouch, you can get additional apps that were created by many other people and are very handy.Now on to a few of the problems


 In my week of using the iTouch, I have experienced some things wrong
 First, the wifi


 I can't seem to connect to my wireless internet connection but if I go to a pulic hotspot, the connection is flawless

 It may be the iPod or it may be something up with my router

 Needless to say, there are tons of people with problems with the iTouch's wifi
 Most people say it is something with the router's setting while other say that their problem was fixed when restoring the iTouch


 I shall call Apple today and fix this problem.So, overall...the iTouch is a must buy

 And depending on how much money you have to spend, I would get this version since it is cheaper than the 8GB version without the software upgrade (which includes some left out apps that the iPhone has).I definitely recommend this product
 Get it and you shall love it

$review_text.: I have been using this for a little over a year.  Two drives have gone bad and now they don't know what is bad so they want me to replace the entire unit.  It has taken me to days so far with them.  3 unreturned phone calls.  2 unanswered emails and then they send me an email saying they could not get ahold of me.  I am retired and have not gone anywhere.  I have an answering system on my phone and have been receiving phone calls.  When I talked to the tech last night he was VERY nice and helped to find my proble.  He said I needed to replace the unit.  He said he would fill out the paperwork and call me back.  He didn't fill out the paperwork or call back.  They wanted to know everything about the unit, when I bought it and where.  The unit is registered and he told me he had all my information but their email was rude and said they didn't even know who I was.  The note said I had to send them this information then they would review it before issuing me an RMA that I would be charged for.  If I returned the defective unit in 15 days they would issue a credit to me.  I am giving serious consideration to just junking it.  Any one want one?They have now told me that all they can do is sell me a new unit with drives.  They do not sell empty boxes or power supplies.I bought a Infrant ReadyNAS empty box.  They cost a bit more but are a much better company and do sell parts for their boxes.
$SUMMARY.: It is a very very bad company

$REVIEW.: I bought this charger to replace one that had been lost in a move. It worked well, stayed cool under load and I never had a problem with it.. Then one afternoon I fried the graphics card in my laptop and well.. that was that.. The carger now sits in a storage bin waiting to be used again on another computer I hope.
$review_summary.: It did what it was intended to do. Charge a laptop.

$REVIEW.: I bought these to use with Dragon Naturally Speaking.  They work great even though they are not on the recommended list.  Very comfortable, and uses a micro usb to charge.  I use the bluetooth instead of the wireless.  It's nice that you can take your choice and even switch back and forth.As usual, Logitech has good quality stuff.
$review_summary.: Comfortable and high quality

$review_text.: From what I've seen so far, these cables work great, and there's absolutely no reason to spend several times their cost for a brand name.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent value for the money, works like the expensive ones.

For the price, this was great and they are not too flimsy to handle (read not cheap).

$review_text.: I bought one of these about a year ago and have been using it in rotation with two other batteries, one of which is the original Canon battery that came with the camera. I recently dropped my original Canon battery so I thought I should be prepared in case it took offense to such thoughtless handling. So, I went back to my Amazon orders log, looked up my previous purchase and found the product still available, but from a different seller. I have to say that my jaw dropped when I saw the price. Unbelievable! Under $3.00, shipping and all! Wow! I quickly ordered 2 more. You can never have too many batteries...These batteries are perfect! Not only do they last at least as long as the original Canon battery, they also charge a whole lot faster. I have marked an "L" on the Canon battery with a Sharpie pen to remind myself to put the timer on longer for that one. It takes at least 30 minutes longer to charge than the OEM ones. They take about 55 minutes each from empty.What a great find! This is a great deal!
$review_summary.: Canon SD950is Digital camera - Awesome battery at amazing price!

$REVIEW.: A bit more challenging to get it 'perfectly aligned', but once on, good-to-go.  Not quite as smooth a surface/texture as the cover that came with the Nexus 10 from the factory, but still, performs as advertised with no liquid nightmares causing short circuits.
$SUMMARY.: Works.

$REVIEW.: So, it looks the same as the Canon one. But, for the total of less than $5.00 I paid for it, including shipping - I can't complain. I turn it around and mount it backwards when not using it, or for storage. Seems to work on sunny days!
$review_summary.: It looks right.

$review_text.: We have a fast processor and plenty of memory, as well as a decent video card. The image this camera produces is still pretty herky-jerky, and the color just plain sucks. Audio is nothing to jump up and down and clap about, either.

$REVIEW.: Just got this 1050 watt PSU from Corsair to replace a burned out Thermaltake 1200 watt PSU.Great investment even though it's not the top of the line, it is still a rock solid reliable, cool and quiet PSU for overclocking, gaming, or general PC use.Cool is the main adjective that comes to mind. Air expelled from the rear of the unit feels about like room temperature. Also very quiet,my case fans are all I hear.Update:After about a month and a half of use, my original 1050 quit. it took out an SSD with it too i fear. RMAed it to Corsair and received a replacement that is still running. Hopefully this one lasts, so far so good. At this point i would have to take off 1 star of my rating due to the initial failure.Still a decent PSU though, and warrantied for 7 years.

$REVIEW.: The Good: The buttons work in an intuitive way
The cost is reasonable, compared to typically way overpriced official MS XBOX productsThe Bad: The IR signal is pathetically weak

 I am sitting approximately 8 feet from the XBOX, and unless it pointed at exactly the correct angle it does not work


For me this is next to useless, it is a near total FAIL

 I would only buy this if sit close to the XBOX with a somewhat perpendicular angle, or if you intend to use an IR Repeater etc


 I'll give it to my wife, who's XBOX is only 6 feet away from her couch.UPDATE: The problem seems to be that the IR Signal does not like to go through glass
 If the front of the XBOX is not covered by glass, and is fairly well exposed, it seems to work OK

 The signal seems a little weak, and the buttons sporadically don't seem to respond unless you press them very hard and deliberately


 Updated rating to 3-Stars.

$review_text.: How much can you really say about an online game code?! In this case, I ordered it, got the code within 2 minutes, applied it using XBox.com, and it worked perfectly. The process was executed perfectly, and Amazon did their job. No, you're likely not going to get any special pricing on this code as opposed to looking in other places, but for instant need, it's great.Also, if you're an XBox Live Family member, this is the best way to buy points as opposed to doing it through your XBox, which requires permission of the master account. Time saving advice for those who utilize that.
$review_summary.: Instant Delivery, Code Worked
