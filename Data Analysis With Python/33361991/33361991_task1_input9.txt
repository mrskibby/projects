$REVIEW.: This is my second netbook.  The first was the Msi wind so for me to give up that awesome 2nd generation net-book took quite a bit.  The asus build quality is just great, no flex or creaking.  The keyboard is a dream to type on.  But this is just a repeat of most other positive reviews.  So ill get to the point of this review.The Crucial memory upgrade, I purchased the Crucial 800mhz module for the 2 gb upgrade. It works great, however when on power saving mode it won't fully shut down.  I have tested this with the original 1 gig of memory and found that on occasion the PC wouldn't shut down properly with that memory either.  I think its a super hybrid engine problem, not a memory problem.  On high performance and super performance it shuts down just fine.  That's fine in my case because i don't use the power saving anyhow.  It's too laggy.  Even on high performance the battery still lasts more than 10 hours so I'm good to go.  I am running the newest bios 0901 and still the shutdown problem persists for those looking to squeak out as much life as possible from their battery.  Otherwise the performance is much improved with 2 gigs of memory.  There is room to cache now.  With 1 gig it took firefox about 12 seconds to start up.  Now that windows superfetch has some room to breath it starts in under 3 seconds.  Video performance has improved as well.So in conclusion,  do the upgrade its worth it.  I'm sure Asus will upgrade the bios eventually to make shutdowns perfect in all settings.Ill update as new bios versions are released.Update.  I didn't think originally that i would care for windows 7 starter.  It's a little bland looking and the windows animation is not as smooth.  Plus aero peek doesn't show the page just a link to it.  But after using it for a week or so i decided not to upgrade it, because the upgrade to home premium might make it look better but the added functionality is not really worth 79 dollars.  I can play dvds on mine with vlc, heck after installing vlc and ac3 decoder i can watch dvds with windows media player.  Media center was not necessary either i can watch my recorded tv shows from my desktop computer on media player with no problems right over the network.  And as for homegroup simplified networking, I never found a use for it anyway.  I guess im just a user level security kind of guy.Just a note, asus has a utility to change the background.  Just do a little hunting and you'll find it in no time.So in conclusion give starter a chance, it works just fine.
$SUMMARY.: Great netbook.  Crucial memory upgrade works for my needs.

$REVIEW.: I have had a Roku for some time now, and when I saw that Roku came out with this little stick I had to have it!  Now I can have Roku on my wall-mount TV in the bedroom without having to worry about placement of a box.  The one thing I did not expect is that it has to be powered by being charged or via a USB outlet on the TV.  I just assumed the HDMI connection would do it all.  I panicked when I realized it had to be charged/powered, but luckily my TV set (which is a little older) did have one USB connection for me to connect it for power.Roku is great for streaming from Amazon Prime and other streaming media sources.

$REVIEW.: This is much better than downloading images from a digital camera, especially if you have more than one brand of camera.  The image transfer is fast, and the jpgs are unmolested so the exif data comes over correctly (if that matters to you).One tip for Win2k users - DON'T install the software that comes with the card reader.  Just plug it into the USB port, and the native Win2K drivers will see it.  If you do install the software, you will end up on the phone with their support uninstalling things, like I did.  Although, the phone support was good.Overall, a really good product and worth having.

$REVIEW.: terrible image quality, if you are lucky to be able to stream something... From a PC : Windows Media player does not stream to this device. Embeded WMV videos  or streamed WMV videos will not play on this device. So there is an &#34;experimental&#34; stream your desktop option, well, that doesn't stream sound with it...  I was able to stream a local video by browsing the file system with chrome, the video will stop every 30 seconds to &#34;Cache&#34;, how can anyone watch a movie like that.From an android tablet, the chrome browser does not stream to this device common video players do not stream to this device, except for Plex, but you need to be a register plex user...

$REVIEW.: This is a great pair of headphones for use on the iPhone for calls or for light music use
The included inline remote controls call functions and some of the playback settings, play/pause - they match in functionality the included Apple headphones, while having a superior sound


I found the bass to be somewhat limited though for listening to rock and roll of other bass-heavy sounds
The plastic packaging grabs the wires very tight, so you need to exercise a lot of care not to pull on the wire too much and risk damaging it


While it is easy to open, pulling the wires out of the molded plastic is a bit more challenging
They come installed with medium-size silicone earbuds, and there is also a set of sound isolating earbuds available


The medium size sound isolating earbuds improve the sound a bit over the standard issue ones, but I managed to develop ear fatigue after a prolonged listening session.Overall a highly recommended set of headphones if you value the inline remote for music and calling control
The included microphone also seems to work great according to the report from the other end of the line for a test call


If you don't need to included remote, I would spend the money on a model that has improved bass, so for the same price there are better sounding options (even also from Sony)

Since I intend to use these mostly for voice calls and the occasional minutes-long music listening on commutes, this is a fair tradeoff for me.

$REVIEW.: Pros:- Stylish and lightweight- Very organized, lots of pockets with zippers, all the stuff can be easily kept in order- Hidden pocket for wallet is very useful for a traveler- Rain protection coverCons:- As it was mentioned before, shoulder straps do not have sufficient padding. After a few hours of walking with the backpack full of stuff, the inconvenience becomes evident. I'm comparing it with the comfort of my NorthFace backpack, which is a lot better in this sense.- Rain protection cover sits well only if the backpack is not on your back, otherwise you need to adjust it frequently, since the construction of shoulder straps prevent the cover to stay on top of the notebook compartment. That's a serious flaw for the backpack.- Hand strap is pretty useless once backpack is full. Lifting the backpack reveals the weakness of the whole construction.- There is no hard bottom, so I decided to use extra divider to protect the bottom of my lens.Bottom line:- Suites for light DSLR camera, short trips and good weather.

$REVIEW.: The diffuser slips into your hot-shoe mount on your SLR. Cost less than half the price for similar diffusers and does the same job. I was surprised at how well this softens the on-board flash so the subject does not appear &#34;blasted&#34; from your flash. The only drawback is that the diffuser will bounce light back into your eye if you are composing the shot with your eye to the viewfinder. An effective and economical solution to diffuse your flash. I would recommend this product.

$REVIEW.: This is my second articulating mount. What I love most about this brand is that you can swivel it from left to right (or the opposite of course) and it will turn just at the joint closest to the TV. In other words after you do your little &#34;just getting it right routine&#34; with all the swivels (like your car seat) you can do the old left/right without losing all that time & work you spent to get it just right in the first place.

$review_text.: After reading all the reviews, I decided to order this kit. It's exactly as described many times below. While I find the stands not bad at all, of course they cannot compete with $100 light stands and are not meant to! The umbrellas are fine and two each is a great plus although perhaps a bit small(ish). They of course work just fine. The white one can be used either as a shoot through or reflected. Works as expected either way.My goal as to build a quick inexpensive studio light set up. I use CowboyStudio flash triggers on a pair of Yongnuo YN-560-II strobes. The camera is a Sony a77. Which brings up a point worth noting. If you use Sony flashes, either the super expensive Sony ones or the Yongnuo (which are every bit as good as the Sony one for 1/4 the price!!!) be aware that the mounts included with this kit WILL NOT accommodate the Sony style hot shoe. Being the CowboyStudio triggers I'm using accept the Sony flash and then attach via a standard ISO shoe makes this a non issue. But if you are going to attach your flash directly to these mounts, all Nikon/Canon etc flashes will work fine, just not SONY!!One reviewer noted that the umbrella mounting hole is 'too low". Indeed it is! If the umbrella is attached there, the flash will not be centered. Interestingly enough, the flash trigger has it's own umbrella mounting slot and the included umbrellas fit in there just fine. So, for me the kit (even with using Sony flashes) is 100% useable.I'll have to agree with one reviewer about the included case. It's terrific. I'm not sure what I would do without it. Everything fits in it easily with room for the flashes and perhaps even a few more items. It's constructed fairly nicely too!.So, overall all I highly recommend this package if you understand that it's not going to compare to a true professional kit of stands, mounts and umbrellas. Of course, that would cost 100X more. It deserves 5 stars for what it is, but overall as a product I give it 4 stars. I hope this helps someone! If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to regain use of the steering wheel controls after putting an aftermarket radio in. It was very easy to install, since I installed the radio. Three wires and that was it. Certainly looks like it could get involved depending on the after market head unit you have, but if you can utilize the 1/8&#34; jack, it should be easy.Note: If the unit doesn't automatically recognize and set-up, you will have to do it manually. I had to do this. The first part of the process is to hold the up volume on the steering wheel during the initial recognition period and it should hook up, it didn't for me. I had to hold it down for the initial recognition period, plus through the error code process where it will flash the codes for the head unit and I believe the auto maker. But regardless, if you have to hold it through all of that, it should work. It did for me, and they didn't say in the instructions to do this.

$REVIEW.: I own a ridiculous number of headphones
 It's like I have a headphone fetish


 Weird!  But why?  A different headphone for every purpose
 The purpose of these is "walk around headphones to use with my iPhone"
 And for that purpose, they are great!They sound good, lots of bass for the size/weight/price and are comfortable for long listening sessions

I bought the one with the mic so they work with the iPhone for voice calls (it is my understanding that sometimes people use their iPhones to "talk" to other humans)
 (all joking aside, every once in a while I do the same).They fold up for putting into a backpack, and even include a little travel bag.I'm a fan of the single wire solution

 Less wire to get tangled and pulled when moving about or scratching your chin.I'm a HUGE fan of the open air HD555, HD585, HD518 headphones, which are huge and really useful for using in the comfort of your home, or at work


 But these little ol' PX 100-II are good for walking around town, at work, talking on the phone


 They fold up to put away so you can have them with you.Gizmodo recommended these as their favorite "wear all day" lightweight cans, and I couldn't agree more
 I bought them 'cause Gizmodo said to, and now I'm a satisfied customer.P.S


 My ears don't have that extra bit of cartilage to hold in earbuds, hence my search for the perfect lightweight good-sounding headphones with mic.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to thoroughly test this antennae before writing a review on it. So what I did was plug it into my Windows Media Center PC with aHauppauge 1192 WinTV HVR-1950 External USB HDTV Tuner/Video Recorder. To that I have attached a standard inexpensive RCA rabbit ear antennae. By going into the WMCenter PC I can run setup and determine the digital TV antennae strength. After running that I can determine how many stations I can receive at full strength which is 6 bars. I then hooked up the Mohu Ultimate antennae and ran the same test. I was able to rescan and compare the results. (Don't get discouraged, wait until you see the HDTV direct into the TV set results)In order to be considered a good station it had to have full reception measured by 6 bars. The rabbit ears sitting in the middle of the bed where the laptop was I received 12 channels. The Ultimate Antennae in the same spot only received 4 channels and some of them were not consistently 6 bars in each test. So then I tried the Ultimate Antennae on the different walls since that is the way they tell you to use the antennae, and the best wall I received 9 stations, which is still not as good as the 12 I received with the RCA rabbit ears antennae. I was discouraged.Then I remembered them saying in the instructions about it needing to be plugged into a high def receiver, and even though the Hauppauge TV tuner receives high def I decided to test the Ultimate antennae directly into the my high def set. It is a Samsung 46" LCD HDTV. First I plugged the RCA rabbit ears into the TV. With the rabbit ears I received 25 channels. Hooking up the Ultimate antennae I received 45. That's not a typo, I received 45 channels. Then I wanted to check their clarity. All 45 channels came in crystal clear with no freeze ups or digital glitches. Two of the channels said, "Mode not supported" which had nothing to do with the reception.So there it is if you position it on the wall in the right spot, and that spot may only be a foot or two away from another spot because it is picky, you can get 45 channels instead of 25 with the rabbit ears. One point I want to bring up about the laptop results is that by default the Hauppauge TV tuner only gets the main channels, so it can get 3, 6, 10, etc. but regular TV's can get the sub channels as well such as 3, 3-2, 6, 6-2, 6-3, etc. which is part of the reason of such a disparity of results. Notwithstanding the results go way beyond that because even a lot of the main channels that I could not get a good signal, or any signal from on the laptop came through crystal clear and strong with the Ultimate antennae. So this is the real thing. It really works, and yes WOW it really works. This is a powered antenna that plugs into the wall with the included A/C adapter. The RCA rabbit ears is not a powered antenna.So mounting it on the wall does give you better reception rather than just having it in the room. At first I was surprised that they did not include a base that would provide a desktop option the way rabbit ears are mounted. Now I know why; on the wall rules with this antennae. Fortunately they supply you with pins both white and black to match which side you are installing this flat plate antennae. It is white on one side, and black on the other. They also provide you ample small round foam discs with double sided sticky tape in the event you do not want to perforate your walls with two pins.So this is an unobtrusive design that sits flat on the wall and really maximizes the signal. No need to install roof top antennas when you get this kind of signal strength right in the room. For those of you who are paying large sums of money every month to a cable and satellite provider why not consider free. The over the air waves high def is the highest quality high def that you can get. Even fiber optic, dish, and cable transmit 1080i because of the bandwidth challenges trying to transmit 1080P. Only with a Blu-ray player or HD-DVD can you get a real 1080P signal. Fortunately there are line doublers, or upscale boxes at 2X or 4X that create a 1080P equivalent. I have been enjoying that with the Cisco Media Center Extender hooked up to the Ethernet network. With that I receive all of the goodies like being able to record two shows at once. Or watch one and record another. So for those times when my Windows Media Center PC gets finicky right in the middle of a show which happens about once a week, so I have to reboot the PC, this antennae makes a nice option; all I have to do is pick up the remote to the TV and choose a different input, and not miss a beat. Hey now that I think of it, with this setup I can set the Win Media PC to auto record two different stations, and then click the Ultimate antennae input to watch a third live.I bought my Win Media PC setup about three years ago, and when I think about how much per month I was spending on just watching TV I decided to cut the dish bill and buy the PC. I haven't looked back since. I receive the highest definition with the upscaling in the Media Center extenders; I can skip commercials with the 30 second skip button, and watch what I want, where I want. And now that the Ultimate TV is hooked up to the TV as well as the Ethernet input I can switch over and enjoy the additional channels/sub channels I have been missing. The best of both worlds, and I saved enough money in three years that I could pay cash for a very big screen smart TV. I won't tell you what I paid over an 11 year period for my dish service before. You could go out and buy a new car for that. Now it is all free.This isn't relative to this antennae, but by the way get anOoma Telo Free Home Phone Servicehooked up to your network and talk for free every month too. Yes unlimited free calling all over the US. All you have to pay for is the Fed Excise fees which are only a few dollars per month, and you own your own phone line, and phone number with tons of call services like Caller ID, answer call, and remote access to your Ooma lounge to retrieve messages, or you can get them right from your Ooma base, and the list goes on. Anyhow this is a great antenna. I can't find anything wrong with it if you use it for its intended purpose, and that is directly into a high def TV. Highly recommended.
$SUMMARY.: Not too great for Win Media Center tuner, but for HDTV it is a WOW

If you're looking for bells and whistles, etc., this is not the case for you - those cost much more

However, the Acase Case serves its purpose and protects my iPad on all sides

I haven't gone as far as purposely dropping my iPad to test the case's protection, but it looks and feels very durable.This case is good for professionals who don't want to spend a ton of money
The case is made of black leather that is always a good choice in any professional setting
The soft side of the case also folds to hold the iPad at a good reading angle - I find the folding feature much easier to use with this case than on the Apple SmartCase I used previously (my iPad was constantly falling over with the SmartCase).

$review_text.: This replaces a Panasonic SL-PH270 that served me well for six years but is becoming increasingly erratic (my dropping it on cement didn't help) and is no longer manufactured.  Suffice it to say that I'd gladly spend 2-3 times as much for another Panasonic personal player with onboard speakers than have to settle on a JWin.  But unlike the other JWin I tried out (along with a GPX and Colby), this one plays even when it's moved and turned upside down. 4 stars is admittedly overly generous, but given the skip-and-stick action of other cheap models and the lack of competing product (an "ordinary" CD player with speakers in the cover), I'm determined to make myself like it.The pluses (from my perspective): 1. "Dedicated" CD player (no MP3's, compression ratio options, and other annoying complications).  2. It pops open and boots up your CD in a jiffy.  3. The onboard speakers allow for quick and efficient searching of the content of CDs and testing of their playability. 4. It's just loud enough for the user to hear it.  5. The 60-second memory makes the anti-shock system effective.The minuses: 1. The audacity or absurdity of the manufacturer to market this as a "stereo player" (the speakers are less than an inch apart!) and the marginal loudness of the speakers (the Panasonic's onboard speakers, though on a smaller surface, put out twice the volume). 2. The quickly tossed-in AM-FM radio (FM reception is totally absent without plugging in the headphones to serve as an antenna, though the tuning dial is too stiff to bother with even if the radio had decent reception).  3. Tiny, dark display (keep a penlight handy).  4. Teeny tiny buttons (pimples) for operating stop, go, pause, skip (the Panasonic's were twice the size despite the smaller size of the player).  5. The inclusion in the battery compartment of a little folded-up piece of paper with instructions telling the user to hang on to and employ an included, loose, tiny metal cap when using rechargeable batteries.As for the headphones, I simply tossed them--have too many from previous players as it is.  It does have one feature lacking on the Panasonic: a prominent yellow&black; sticker on the back of the player helpfully advising the user to charge only rechargeable batteries, followed by the fragment--"May cause explosion."  Sounds exciting--just don't misplace that tiny metal cap.

It made the slim, lovely, iPad into a bulky, highly protected, but still fully functioning street computer

The screen protecter works great, the snap-on stand is a so-so feature, but the case is great for protecting the tablet


The button/speaker/connector covers are a little difficult to open and keep out of the way, but that's the price you pay for protection.Mine did not come with a cover for the front of the protected screen, but I made one up from a piece of formica, a 1/4" piece of foam, and a flat strap, mostly for traveling.All in all a great way to protect your treasured tablet.

Here are my system specs:- Intel i7-3770k CPU (Retail, boxed, used Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound)- Intel RTS2011 Liquid Cooling CPU cooler with 120mm fan- Intel DZ77GA-70K motherboard running 0064 BIOS (flashed to 0064 on 3/15/2013)- Crucial 32GB DDR3 RAM (Ballistix Sport)- Intel 120GB Model 330 SSD (SATA III)- PNY GTX 650 video card- WD 3TB Red hard drive (SATA III)- Corsair 650D case with 3 x 200mm fans- Corsair 750AX power supply- LG DVD RW drive- Monsoon Planar speakers and subwoofer- Windows 7 Enterprise 64bit OSI'm overclocking the CPU, and I'm at 4.5GHZ at 32 degrees C at rest and 75 degrees C at 100% CPU utilization. The board was extremely easy to setup, tweak and leave running. I've updated the BIOS several times and the last time (0064), I had to set my BIOS settings to "default" prior to applying the BIOS update and everything worked once I did that. I have never had a BSOD and the PC runs very well. I use the BIOS to update my settings (overclocking) as I found this is more reliable than the Intel Extreme Performance Utility that runs on Windows 7. All drivers are current and I'm 100% satisfied with this motherboard, it really shines with this CPU! I'm not a gamer (hence the GTX 650 video card), but I tested my son's GTX 660 OC video card in my PC and it was fantastic and the performance in the latest games (BF3, Crysis 3, etc...) was smooth and fast!I use my PC for work and I use a lot of virtual machines and Oracle's VirtualBox runs great on this PC and the VM's perform just like an actual PC running that particular OS, which is what I wanted. Documentation is there, you just have to search for it on Intel's website and the accompanying technical information is staggering, if you want to read it! The Corsair 650D is a big, heavy case, but it holds all of the components, keeps them cool and I can't hear any fans at all, so it's doing exactly what I expect it to do. I read up on the issues some others had with this board, but I have not had any issues at all, so this is just another data point... I'm not an employee of Intel and have no financial interest in Intel, I'm just a very satisfied customer! BTW, I'll be installing Win8 soon and I'll update my review after that experience... Thanks!Update on 5/9/2013 after moving to Windows 8...I've upgraded my system to Win8 and I also have Classic Shell installed, so the PC boots to the desktop and Classic Shell interface, so it looks just like Win7, but is Win8. Win8 runs faster and has a few features that I really like (much improved file transfer interface, better task manager, better device managemr functionality, etc...). The upgrade was realy a clean install as I had an image backup of my Win7 install and my data is all backed up on my home server. I strongly recommend the clean install and not the in-place upgrade or dual-boot approach as I had issues with both of those. No problems at all and I'm running at 4.5GHz (45x100 bclock)and my temps are lower than 95 degrees F. I put another fan on my Intel liquid cooling radiator, so it's now configured as a "push-pull" (one fan on each side of the fan, both arrors in the same direction) and the temps dropped 10 degrees F, so it really works without making too much noise. I'm 100% satisfied!

$review_text.: There are a ton of reviews here so I won't repeat everything about the system itself, but here is the absolute best way to setup these cameras:1. Make sure your home router and cable/DSL/fiber modem are all connected to a UPS.2. Purchase a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch with enough ports to handle however many cameras you will be setting up.3. Connect the PoE switch to a free port on your router, and plug the power connection into the UPS.4. Run network cable from the new PoE switch through your attic, basement, etc. to each location where you want to mount a camera (drop it down through the ceiling for ceiling mount, through the soffit panels for exterior undermount, into a standard RJ45 jack enclosure if you want to just sit the camera on a shelf inside, etc.). Use bulk network cable for this and simply crimp the RJ45 ends on the cable at each end (or for a more professional setup terminate the cables into a patch panel near the PoE switch).5. Connect each camera to your remote cable location using only the network port on the camera (no need to use power adapters, in fact when you purchase additional cameras Logitech now sells versions that don't include the powerline network adapters. These sell for significantly less too!)6. Use the software as specified to configure the cameras... you're done!This setup allows you to easily place cameras anywhere in your house with no need to run bulky (and potentially dangerous) AC wiring or extension cords. The cameras are connected straight to your network for maximum reliability. Since the PoE switch is the only source of power, and since it is connected to your UPS, then all the cameras will continue to record even if the power goes out. Since your router and modem are also connected to the UPS you will still be able to monitor your cameras remotely when the power is out as well.

$review_text.: I upgraded from a c330 streetpilot model after the 2008 maps were released on the 680. I live and work in NW Atlanta where there is alot of traffic, and was intrigued by the traffic feature. I also wanted a handsfree bluetooth speaker for calls in the car.Navigation- 4/5-noticable improvements with the upgraded maps, however still somewhat lacking for areas with frequent construction (i.e. Atlanta). The Garmin has difficulty with large shopping malls and strips with long paved roads leading away from an intersection. Example is a Costco that has been present for a few years listed on the map as being right off a large street; this is not true however, as the store is situated a quarter mile up the road among several other stores/resturants. It also occasionally recommends long routes instead of simply turning at an intersection; this typically happened on 4-lane streets/state highways. Unit doesn't have a feature letting you program a favorite route. Points of interest not very reliable for shops less than two years old or been closed within the past two years. For locations that are not experiencing rapid urban sprawl it is very reliable.Bluetooth-5/5-required a firmware update to my treo 650, however afterwards worked flawlessly. You can dial and receive calls through the GPS. Much safer than fumbling with the phone.MP3-5/5-works fine as a podcast or MP3 player through the built-in speaker or FM transmitter to your car stereo.Traffic-2/5-most disappointing part. The feature is limited strictly to the basic interstate highways. That's not too bad except the time estimates are also way off in my opinion. As an example the unit displayed road construction causing an estimated 1 min delay with the highway listed in green (green for light, yellow medium, red heavy) so I decided not to detour. This resulted in 15 minutes of sitting in stop and go traffic for 3 miles. Another major goof is the lack of traffic coverage for I-575, a major 6 lane highway in NW Atlanta used by thousands of commuters but not covered. Forget traffic coverage of major secondary roads used as alternates for commuters. So your stuck being unable to compare the traffic conditions to let you pick your poison each day. I guess it's better than nothing and would be useful if there was a major accident, however in its current form it is minimally useful in avoiding stop and go traffic. Take the 6 months additional discounted MSN service for $10 when you first sign up and pass on the lifetime service as it is tied to the unit and not the owner.My suggestion to Garmin for future updates is for the unit to display two routes whenever you select a location. This should be incoporated with the traffic function which needs to include at least major side roads used by morning/afternoon commutes. It gets annoying when I select a route to work and the unit every single time picks the same route that goes through the heart of traffic which I always ignore. Better yet how about the unit remembering and updating trip times based on time and day of the week? You could at least teach the unit of how silly some of its suggested routes are in real life.

$review_text.: The case of this replacement battery seemed to be identical to the original.  After a few hours of charging, the indicator light turns solid green and it is able to power the laptop.  The problem is that after being plugged in for an extended period of time, say 6 - 8 hours, the light begins to flash yellow, indicating that the battery is failing.  If I unplug the charger, the flashing stops and the laptop will run on the battery.  The battery seems to work, but I'm concerned that there is a problem with it, as shown by the yellow flashing light.

$REVIEW.: First let me start saying that I love my older IRiver IFP-395 (512 MB), but I decided to upgrade for faster downloads, more storage capacity and timed recordings.After receiving this new 799, I put it through its paces.The player is fine especially when considering the price and all the features you are getting, but unfortunately it has some design flaws that are unacceptable IMO.First, the sound quality is a notch below the older players (no scientific test) but it is my impression

The sound lacks punch or more correctly 'dynamic range', maybe a trade off for the extra long battery life chips?For the record, my very old Creative Nomad MG still sounds better than the 300 or 700 series.Second, unlike the ifp-395 the joystick in the ifp-799 is very erratic, and honestly I don't think is a matter of 'getting used to it'.Third, the 3 buttons on top are very easy to accidentally touch so you have to use the hold switch too many times which is impractical.Fourth, the in-line jack which gets used rarely remains wide open to the elements like water, dust, etc.IRiver could have easily solved that problem by providing a $.02 plastic plug for that jack, I was fortunate to have one from an old camcorder so it is safe now.Fifth the USB door is too flaky, is a good idea at first, but it fails in its implementation, it feels exactly like the door of a car toy, and it won't remain closed.The IFP-800 series *IS* superior, physical design wise, since it inherit all the best from the previous 300 series like the buttons, the USB door, etc.Unfortunately for both 700 and 800, the sound quality, which is one of the most important factors for me didn't lived to my expectations.So I'm no hesitating to return it.I am getting a Cowon IAudio G3 with 1Gig instead, a bit more expensive, but it has exactly all the features of theIFP-700 series plus the best sound quality of all Flash based players.If price is more important to you than the sound quality I think the IFP-799 would be fine despite those design shortcomings.If you can choose between the 800 and 700 go with ---&#62;the 800 series, but unfortunately Amazon doesn't carry them nor the better Cowon products.I also have to say that I like Amazon for their great prices, quality of service and return policy.

$review_text.: I have a desktop setup (i7 920 2.7ghz, 12gb ram, 1tb hd), and I'd heard how fast SSDs made your computer. I'd been on the fence about upgrading, having read some reviews about failure rates, DOA products, etc. I came across a few articles talking about Intel's quality being worth it even though the SSD by them was more expensive. I decided to try the 520 240 gb reseller kit (reseller kit comes with the hardware to mount onto a desktop).I'm amazed by how quickly Windows 7 boots up! I went with a fresh install, and kept my old traditonal hard drive as a secondary internal hard drive. I only have the OS and a few Steam games installed on the SSD.

It's durable where it needs to be and still maintains a decent weight without killing your back.

$review_text.: So that you don't misunderstand the title of this review, this thing weighs a ton. But if you are bringing your huge flat screen TV, and your surround system, and assorted AV equipment with you overseas, add this to the list.Note: it gets warm. But it's a power transformer, so that's to be expected. I just don't leave it on because I don't want to waste the electricity that is keeping it warm. We have all of our AV equipment plugged into power strips (also purchased in the US) which are plugged into the front of this unit. Whenever we want an AV experience, we flip the blue switch and give the systems a minute to boot up. When we're done, we flip the whole setup off via the blue switch on the transformer. Since the transformer also has a 220V plug on the face, we hook up our locally purchased 220V AV equipment to it as well.It does hum a little sometime, but it isn't a bother. After daily use for more than 1 year, we have no complaints.Note 2: This transformer will NOT work well with AC motors. No transformer will. It transforms the voltage to 120V, but it does not change the frequency. A motor designed for 60Hz will not be happy on 50Hz (everywhere outside of the US & Canada).

$review_text.: "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today"The above quote is from British Vice-Admiral Beatty at the Battle of Jutland (1916) as he watched another British battlecruiser explode and sink. Though he didn't know it at the time, the problem was not with the specific ships themselves, but rather with the general design of the vessels. The idea of a fast light heavily armed ship meant it had to have skimpy armor, which means enemy shells would easily penetrate armor and then blow up the heavy magazine loads of munitions that were intended to be fired from the heavier cannon.Why is this relevant? Well, BT headphones won't explode and / or sink, but they all seem to be pretty mediocre, and at this point after owning five sets of them, I am wondering if there are certain design flaws that are mandated as part of the BT headphone design process. It seems that most manufacturers feel the need to heavily modify the sound signal in one extreme direction or another to camouflage flaws in the "bare" sound quality, and it also seems that the heavier frames needed to house all the BT related chips makes for a creaky weighty wearing experience.Comparatively brief reviews of the MonoPrice HiFi, Harman Kardon BT, and Creative Aurvana Gold follow. (I also reviewed the Sony MDR1 BT on Amazon separately, and also owned the awful Parrot Zik for a while, which I did not review due to my relatively speedy return of it.) Suffice to say that audiophiles or even those with a moderate priority on accurate clear sound need not purchase any of these. Only those who prioritize Bluetooth features over all other qualities will be happy with any of these, and even so, there are some clear winners and losers in the mix, though there are some "interesting failures" in the batch which will appear to some subset of the headphone buyer's market.Who needs BT? Well, you lose a 4 foot cord, meaning you won't get snagged on other riders on crowded subway cars quite so easily. You gain full volume control and single press track selection for Android devices along with IOS. (Wired devices for Android cannot control volume unless they use an inline slider, a bad idea.) You gain range, the ability to wander about 20 to 30 feet away from your audio source as you do housework, sunbathe in the yard, etc. Finally, you gain some possible image enhancement as an up to date techie type, which may be a pro or a con for you personally.What do you lose? All of the headphones mentioned here are relatively heavy and large. The HKs look like you have twin Iphones strapped on your ears, and they are the coolest of the three sets. The Creative and MP models look like ugly full size cans from 1990 or so. Unlike most headphone driver assemblies which are mostly empty space and hence light, BT phones have to pack in a lot of extra electronics in the driver to handle the sound sculpting, reception and control modules etc. So all of these headphones are relatively heavy, and, even worse, all of them have "frame creak", where the heavy weight of the cups causes the frame to creak around as you walk or move. If you are listening to Metallica at loud volume, you won't notice (except for maybe the MP model which squeaks like a 17th century galleon) but if you like soothing jazz vocals or piano sonatas the loudish CREAK as the arpeggios trill will be a constant annoyance to you as you move about. The MP is creakiest, followed by the HK, with the Creative model being the best, i.e. least creaky.Here's where we get specific, contenders ranked from worst to best. I used a mix of newish metal (Tool, Opeth, Mastodon) jazz (Miles Davis acoustic period, Bill Evans), alternative / rock (Muse, Decembrists, The National), and classical (Brahms piano concertos by Grimaud, Mahler's Symphony set by Bertini, & Beethoven's last 4 Piano Sonatas by Pollini.Sound Quality:MP: Ugly thick bass permeates all. Tool and Opeth are unlistenable and end up sounding like electronic music. Symphonic stuff (Mahler's 9th by Abbado on DG) ends up sounding distorted and unnatural, though it fares better than metal. Jazz sounds bloated and unbalanced with the bass sounding like 2 or 3 basses got added to the mix. The nail in the audio coffin is the dreadful treble, which sounds muffled and flat. Piano and acoustic guitar is loathsome to hear on these. Any good news? Mids are OK, when not being overpowered by the bass. Classic rock sounds mainly decent as long as there is not too much bass guitar or drum work going on. If you like bass heavy music and are on a tight budget, these are acceptable choices. The low cost of the MPs and well done ancillary feature set (more later) makes them a bit more competitive in the world of BT, as these sound only maybe 50% worse than some headphones (cough, Sony) that cost 100 - 200% more. This grim calculus can be perceived as "value for the money" by the sufficiently parsimonious. Most others though will buy a comparably priced wired headphone and get better sound or will spend a bit more on a BT model that does not so proclaim itself as being an aural penalty box. 1/5.HK: Second place in sound but easily wins Most Frustrating award. Reason: the HK sounds very good at first - slightly warm, well balanced, the polar opposite of all the other bass monster BT phones I've heard. You listen for a bit, smile, and then think "hm, let me turn this up a little, volume is kind of low" and then you realize the volume is at max! Yes, however HK has designed this, reasonable SPL was evidently not a concern. Mind you, I do not like to deafen myself with music, and most times 60% of volume on an Ipod or Galaxy 4 is fine for me with a wired headphone. The HK BT though uses its own separate volume control (as do all the headphones here) and even at max setting, the BT is virtually inaudible on the subway, even with reasonably non-dynamic modern music. With classical music or things like acoustic guitar, even a TV playing at low volume in the same room will utterly obscure the sound. Aggravating this odd volume level issue is the extreme proclivity of the HK's frame to squeak and creak, so you can't really walk around with these either. Even on quite streets the CREEEEEAAAAKKKK of the frame gets in the way of most listening, and if there's traffic on that street, then it starts to drown out everything but the creaks. Very frustrating for new headphones at a not insignificant price point. I returned mine. Yes, the volume level and creakiness could have been flukes in my specific model, but I don't have the time or patience to reorder every defective piece of kit I receive to see if another iteration improves upon the first example. In my book, the HK was a frustrating failure which has significant potential if HK can fix the volume level and flexing frame. As it stands now, the HK is a great headphone to listen to while sitting still in a quiet room. But BT is all about mobility; if all you need is a stationary quiet environment headphone, why not use a wired model instead? 2/5 (4/5 base sound, minus 2 stars for audibility issues.)Creative: The one eyed man in the land of the blind. The Aurvana Gold has somewhat less bass bloat than the MP, though still far too much bass. Listening to Opeth's "Leper Affinity" diagrams the problem nicely. Song starts with guitars, bass guitar and drums all roaring. Thumping jumbled mess. A few minutes in, quite semi-acoustic guitar moment comes along, with the guitar all by itself, and one marvels at the clarity and detail of the Aurvanas when the bass is restrained. Then a few seconds later the bass guitar comes in AND IT SOUNDS THREE TIMES LOUDER THAN IT OUGHT TO, and then the drums come back in and unlistenable chaos reigns once more. (By comparison, the same song on the wired ATH M50s is a model of clarity and detail throughout.) Creative has a decent driver here capable of decent clarity and detail, but their tuning for some reason (The Curse of Bluetooth?) ruins the driver's capability wherever more than nominal bass is present in the music. No volume issues a la HK, and minimal frame flex gives the Aurvana an overall win in this category, as even though the HK has better objective SQ, the HK's audibility is usually obscured by low level and / or creaking. The Creative in comparison isolates well, has ample volume, rarely creaks, and is much better in audio quality than the MP. Again, an emphasis on mobility is what makes a BT headphone for me (as cheaper wired headphones beat any BT model for quiet sitting around the house usage) and that is where the Creative works best out of the three contestants here. 3/5Comfort and Build:MP: Uses Beats style snap hinge, creating long term breakage concerns. Frame squeaks a lot as mentioned above. Ugly shiny plastic that shows fingerprints. Made for small heads, my L size head needed maximum extension, XL craniums beware. Cheap pleather carry bag. Overall impression is of mediocre build quality with snap hinge frame being main point of concern. Comfy enough, gets hot quickly, not too heavy. Better than average isolation, not a bad commuter if you can stand the wretched sound quality. BT control buttons were very responsive, precise, and easy to use. 2/5HK: Surprisingly comfy given odd earpad shape. I needed to swap out the small frame for the larger metal one to achieve a comfy fit, but once this was done, these were very comfortable. As mentioned above, the frame was very creaky. Isolation was rather poor due to the comparatively relaxed fit. When using the included wire, the wire was immensely microphonic and created loud rustling noise in left earcup when it rubbed against any surface, skin, clothing etc, further advancing the concept that HK's product design ergonomics are done by computers rather than humans. BT controls occasionally hard to use due to location and sensitivity issues, i.e. multiple presses needed sometimes. 4/5Creative: Heavy and hot, but comfortable enough in terms of general wear. Quite ugly, even with the interesting triangular driver housing. The plastic used is only somewhat better quality than the MP model, odd and unfortunate given the price difference. The BT controls are good in some ways - one touch on/off/pause/link with battery level aural indicator, but bad in others. (The odd Sony style button hunt to find the Rev/FF control, which is a small rocker switch separate from all other controls, the stiff volume controls that need to be firmly clamped in order to register commands. Creative has a lot to learn from the MP control design! However, does have excellent microphone for phone calls.3/5Features:MP: Excellent battery life (25 or so hours per charge), and the ability to use an SD card for music playback. If you use the SD card, you can then use an onboard equalizer with a limited group of presets. (Sad to say you can't use this EQ function with standard BT playback, as the awful sound of the MP model can be dialed back a bit with the EQ). Cables are fine, carrying pouch is cheap and nasty looking. Overall, a nice feature set for a low price. 4/5HK: Excellent carrying case. Immensely microphonic audio cable that also attaches at an awkward angle. Two different frames so you can swap out one frame for another if your head does not fit with one option. Nice enough, but no surprise given the price point, and the noise magnet cable is bafflingly stupid design. Relatively short battery life (15 hrs per charge) takes a point off. 3/5Creative: Case at least is not pleather. Cables are fine. Has noise cancelling feature that is a nice feature at this price point. The NC is moderately effective using sound sculpting rather than the old school hissy noise approach. NC is not as good as the Bose QC15 but certainly much better than the UE6000, i.e. reduces a moderate amount of external noise without further degradation of sound quality (beyond what already exists in the base non-NC mode). Adds significant value to the model's usability as a commuter as the system does a decent job of making piano sonatas audible on the subway. Includes a signal splitter feature for all of your other Creative BT headphones using friends, i.e. is pretty much a silly novelty. The NC saves the day here, though it does degrade battery life (20 hrs w/o NC, 15 hrs with N/C). 5/5Final Summary:MP: If you absolutely must have a BT headphone, can't spend a lot, and have undemanding musical tastes, these might work for you. Nice feature set, and competes against other awful sounding BT headphones that cost much more. May break sooner rather than later, and styling is utterly unappealing. Grade C-HK: The 1990 Buffalo Bills of headphones. Should have won the championship, but choked. Volume limit, creaky frame, and microphonic wired cable all suggest bad design. The volume issue may well be HK's tacit admission that their driver sounds good only at a certain maximal volume and breaks up after that. Other manufacturers seem to address the signal compression with added bass, and HK has avoided that solution, but the 75 dB wonders it produced instead are arguably a worse solution. Not worth the price now, but a good potential platform for further revision by HK. Grade: BCreative: Though a cheaper wired set of headphones like the ATH M50 will wipe the floors with these in terms of SQ, the noise cancelling feature, great isolation, and BT feature set make these a better commuter than the M50s. Strangely, these are at their best listening to quite piano music on the subway, where the bass bloat is less noticeable and the NC and isolation give the music center stage in a noisy environment. Could have / should have been better, but these are the BT headphones of choice for me, due to their commutability emphasized feature set. Grade: B+

$review_text.: they feel comfortable the first time you use them
 but with regular ear pieces you can just clean them and they are like new

cant really reuse ear plugs to many times and that is essentially what these are

 if they were cheaper they would be worth getting


i have 3 so thats not bad but im afraid to use them cuz i know they wont last long.

$REVIEW.: So I  have bought this to go with a tablet that I have ordered(that is currently back ordered should be shipping on the 24th). It's a sturdy material, strong. It has a bit of a smell but what new leather case doesn't, the smell as already gone away just from me leaving it out in the open for a few hours. Will post more when I get the tablet to see if it actually fits, but so far it's a great little case. Also has a loop for a stylus, I had bought one for 2 dollars(pack of 2 for 4 at walmart) and it holds it nicely.Update: Recieved the tablet today, and it fits perfectly, I really love it!

The power and volume buttons are accessible, and the camera is usable if you slide the Kindle up in the case.  Then when I need the Kindle in a more mobile setting, I pop it back out.  So this is a great stand, but not much of a mobile case - it's way too heavy to carry around.

$review_text.: I'm forced to use headphones late at night to enjoy my vintage Luxman reciever. Only problem ... after an hour or so my "over the ear" style headphones push the thin wire frames of my glasses into the sides of my head. The solution ... Grado's SR 80i "open ear" designed headphones.(Open ear phones can be heard by someone sitting close enough to you and you can hear surrounding noise if it's loud enough. I myself did not find these to be much of an issue since the sound these headphones emit at a medium loud volume level is neglegible) They set lightly "on-top" of my ears instead of completely covering them as with most other headphones. They have a very respectable sound reproduction and I do not think they are cheaply designed as others have reported. If you wear glasses and want a reasonable audiophile experience without breaking the bank I highly recommend Grado's SR 80i headphones.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones for working around the house that wouldn't break the bank
 I've already done that with a a pair of Sennheiser HD-700 and HE-500 and other pieces of "high end" gear
 Ultimately, I just want to be able to use my iPhone 5S or iPad to stream music without wires
 My two choices were the MDR10RBT and Bose AE2W
 Since I already have a pair of AE2i and QC15, I was initially leaning towards the Bose but the Sony had such good reviews that I had to give them a try.The short -The Sony are well worth their money and, at half the price, a compelling purchase

 IF you have the ability to EQ a little, or you really like strong bass, then they're amazing

 If you prefer a "lighter" sound and have the extra money, the Bose are great headphones


 For me, the Sony paired with my iPhone are good with the built in music app, and great when paired with the Equalizer app after some fine tuning (-6dB at 80Hz and +2 at about 4500Hz)
 It's amazing when paired with my macbook with an eq in iTunes

 Here's why...The Long -I'm writing this to try to help clarify some of the bluetooth audio confusion out there...There are a number of different flavors of bluetooth audio


 The most common are SBC, AAC, and Apt-X

 The Sony headphones can do all three


 FWIW, the Bose cannot use the Apt-X protocol, but does use the AAC and high-end SBC protocols.Here's the breakdown (as I understand them):SBC - the most basic protocol

 Bitrates can vary a lot, anywhere up to 256Kb

 As the handshake happens, the bitrate gets set and can change depending upon connection quality

 Good connection = good quality sound


 Not exactly CD, but good
 Bad connection = FM radio quality.AAC - If your music is already in the AAC format (as many iPhones will have), the AAC audio is sent to the headphone and it does the decoding


 So, theoretically, you'll have better sound as your original sound files aren't re-compressed and decompressed through the SBC system

 This also gives you a theoretical increase in sound quality if you encode your AAC files up to 320Kb.Apt-X - A high end codec designed to maintain sound quality to make it as close to CD as possible
 It's supported on many android phones and through OSX, but NOT on IOS devices like the iPhone


 We've been waiting for Apple to support Apt-X for a number of IOS versions now, so it doesn't look hopeful

 I'm guessing that their rationale is that AAC encoding is already good enough and there's no need to pay for rights to Apt-X
 I don't blame them.BTW, if you really want the best audio quality out of these or the Bose, they both include headphone cables
 And, thankfully, they can also be used if the battery dies, so there's a bonus.When connected by SBC, the sound quality of both can be pretty good


 Perhaps a little flabby in the bass and "flat" sounding overall

 But, still good enough for the average Joe


 Moving up to AAC tightens the bass and brings out some detail in the sound quality
 For me, this is certainly good enough for working around the house (as long as the overpowering bass of the 10RBT, themselves, is tamed)


 Apt-X sounds excellent from my Macbook


 The headphone cable adds just a hint - certainly not enough to bother unless the battery dies.The AE2W vs MDR10RBT comparison -Overall, I would describe the AE2W as a lighter headphone and the 10RBT as a darker headphone
 In audiophile terms, the AE2W has a lot of treble energy (perhaps even a little too much at times - the typical Bose sound) and the 10RBT have a strong bass and sub-bass response with rolled off highs


 Again, with a little EQ, the 10 RBT really shine


 Without the EQ, I'd prefer the Bose for their overall less bass-heavy sound.For the rest of this review, I'll be comparing both of them with my favorite EQ setting...Controls:The Sony buttons are well placed and easy to find

 I really like the forward/backward skip and play button combo


 The volume has a tiny dot on the up side to differentiate it

Power and headphone port of easy to find

 The Bose has nice buttons, but somewhat indistinct

 Here, the Sony wins.Comfort:How can you beat Bose?  The Sony is certainly comfortable, and will probably get even more comfortable as the pads break in, but the Bose just flat out win

 Sony wearers shouldn't sweat it - you'll be able to wear them for long stretches.Included audio cable:Neither include an iPhone control cable, it's just a standard TRS to TRS cable
 I have an old Vmoda control cable, so it's no big deal


 BUT, for the price of either of these, a control cable should have been included.Weight:The Bose are very light and the Sony are a bit heavier


 Both are well padded, so in use, neither are heavy enough to bother you, but if you're looking for a featherlight pair, the Bose win.Sound:Once EQ'd, both have an excellent sound

 I was worried that the Sony would not be able to put out good treble energy, but they're actually quite good.They could use a bit more "air," but at this price point, they're better than I expected

 The Bose need a little EQ in the lower mid/bass region and overall have a "lighter" sound

 I think it's fair to say that the Sony would generally be better with rock/electronic/metal while the Bose would be better with pop/jazz/classical
 Having said that, I'm very happy with the Sony.Burn in:The Sony came out of the box very dark
 They tightened up quite a lot in the first 10 hours

 Now, at a whopping 20 hours, they sound great


 Bose tend to come out of the box sounding pretty good, so burn-in isn't quite as big an issue.Balance:Neither headphone are balanced


 Both are "fun" and pretty V-curve-ish, so I wouldn't use either for critical work


 That's not what these are for - they're for enjoying your music and being very portable.Recommendation:I like them both very much, but for the money, the Sony is the overall winner IF you can EQ to customize to your taste
 If I had an endless bankroll and didn't want to EQ my iPhone, I'd probably buy the Bose as the iPhone won't support Apt-X, anyway

 But, since I can use Equalizer and my macbook does support Apt-X, I've decided to keep the Sony
 Overall, I think this will give me the most mileage and the $120 I'm saving can go into more music purchases.Last thought - If sony could lower the mid-bass hump a little and include velour pads, they'd have a real winner, here
 But, at this price point, I wouldn't really expect either of those

 Besides, I doubt they want to compete with their own 1RBT (even though it doesn't support AAC or Apt-X if I understand correctly)
 For the money, these are excellent headphones and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone I know


 I've yet to make a call on them, so I have no info there

 The call quality is not a big concern for me - I'll live with whatever I get
 Calling will happen very infrequently, anyway.1 Week of use edit-------------------They keep getting better and better
 After a couple of days of burn-in, they tighten up a bit and start really sounding good

 Unfortunately, they're still very bass heavy for me
 So, when I set my iPhone 5S to "Bass Reducer," they're great for portable use.When connected to my macbook using apt-x, they really step up another level
 The quality is excellent and the bass is reeled in quite a bit


 I set up EQs in iTunes for 64Hz -3dB, -6dB, and -9dB

 For older material, I use -3, newer material gets -6 and only really bass-heavy recording get me to -9

 The sound quality is absolutely wonderful and I would have no hesitation recommending them over the Bose for anyone


 Just the apt-x quality alone is worth the money, not to mention the AAC quality from an iPhone
 To save space, I have iTunes set to give me 256kb AAC copies of music on the phone and these headphones are just great!There are times that I wish they were a little more isolating, but that's because I have very sensitive ears


 No fault of the headphones.

$review_text.: It's a soft leather shell with very soft interior lining. It looks nice, is well made, and very light. The soft exterior is susceptible to scuffs and scratches, however. It would be nice to have a clasp or some other mechanism to keep the case secured, but for the price it's understandable that it's just a notebook-like cover. It provides some reasonable protection for your Kindle.When set up as it's shown in the picture the USB ports will be located on the bottom and hence obstructed - so you can't have it connected to a charger while you watch movies. However, you can easily just fold the case in reverse fashion so that the USB ports are located at the top of the tablet.All things considered it's a good bargain, as the only cases I've seen that are as light, attractive, and functional are over twice the price.
$SUMMARY.: Good for the price

 I'm sure you could use a double gang box too, but you'd need to cut a hole on the cable side

 The cable side is just open to the wall space


 My TV came with a right angle plug so I had to use another cable with a straight plug because the recessed outlet side didn't have clearance.

$review_text.: I borrowed this lens from a pro photgrapher friend who purchased it in Japan (have since purchased my own lens).  Paired it up with my new Olympus OMD E-5 Micro 4/3 and was totally blown away by the lens and of course camera combination.  The other reviewer went into great detail about it's technical merits - so wont bore you with mine as he was spot on and we are on the same page.This lens coupled with the OMD E-5 produced photographs as good as my Nikon D700 with fixed prime lens at a much lighter weight factor.  Could not beleive the quality of the construction on lens and camera - both built like Army tanks.  The Lens (like the camera) is all metal, very small not quite 3" in length.  AF is very smooth and the zoom is manual via turning a ring on the lens with absolutely no slippage.  Unlike most of the Oly lens, the Panasonic comes with a case and a very useful petal style lens shade.  Olympus should not charge extra for a lens case or a much needed Lens shade for their high end expensive lenses, are you listening Olympus?Best F stop range is 3.5 to 8 for absolute sharp photos from center to corners.  Bokah is very good for the 2.8 f stop range.  No noticable distortion from 24mm to 70mm blown up to 8x10, will try bigger sizes photos down the road but most photos are printed 5x7, and most people print 4x6 anyway.  Very lightweight for an all metal lens with 14 extremely excellent pieces of glass inside and very easy to handle with the larger micro 4/3 cameras and has in-lens IS, which is not needed with the Oly OMD E-5, but yes on other brands. Note it has an on off switch on the lens for the IS.  The lens may ba a little front heavy for the smaller micro 4/3 cameras.I have been into photography as a hobby with my first kodak brownie camera as a young child.Previously 35mm film Nikon F4s (a rather large but excellent camers which I still have) and my Contax G2 were the constant companions.  My favorite combination now is the Panny 12-35mm lens, coupled with the Olympus OMD Digital Camera.  The OMD E-5 is one great little camera that I cannot find much fault with and a carry around always now.  My next lens purchase, once the reviews are all in or if I can borrow it from my photog friend will be the Panasonic 35-100mm f2.8.  Panny, where is this lens, been waiting since the announcement in May??  I think that will be the only other lens I will need for the present time.  Either buy the lens and camera combo (or any of the other micro 4/3 cameras) or rent it to try it out, you will love the light weight and the outstanding performance of the panny - omd combination.UPDATE:  Enlarged some photos to 11x14 and still perfectly clear with no loss of clarity.Tried the Child photo sub-set of 'SCN' function and it worked perfectly, capturing my 2 year old, very active nephew as if he was standing still.  The more I use this lens camera combination the better I like it!  Have not been this excited over a camera lens combo since my beloved Contax G-2.Amazingly 13 people have reviewed this lens and almost all gave it 5 star rating!! UPDATE:  13 reviews now:  score 11 gave 5 star, 2 gave 4 star, perhaps once they have more time with the lens will change to 5 star.The Lens is just super, does what it is supposed to do and although some think it may be pricey, it is cheaper than its DSLR counterparts, lighter and performs just as well.Further update:  Have had the lens and om-d camera for months now and love it as much as my film Contax G-2. Am constantly learning more and more about it via trial and error.  My only two complaints are:  1.  The user manual is nothing more than a very short, un-imaginative and poorly written waste of paper.  There is not even a good instruction telling one to take off certain pieces of the supplied flash in order to attach it to the camera, really no excuse for this.  2:  The Flash is not that great and does not fire all the time, unless I am doing something wrong?  Of course if anyone knows a solution to my dilemma please contact me, would also like to know if anyone knows of a good smallish replacement flash that they have used.Am hoping that David Busch or someone will come out with a very complete substitute user guide/manual that will explain in detail all the features and how to use them properly, especially the flash, or recommendations for a replacement flash that is not bigger than the camera itself.Am also waiting for the just announced (finally), and a little pricy at $1,500 35-100mm Panny lens to be released.  My 12-35 lens came directly from Japan and was a couple of hundred less than here in the states.  WIll probably go the same route for the new lens when available sometime in Dec or Jan. While I like the 12-35 totally, sometimes I want just a little further reach.  Note that the new 35-100 is 3.9 inches in lenght.Other than that the camera lens combo is top notch!Good Luck and Good Shooting.Last Update 12-22-12:  Well since we apparantly made it past the hyped Mayan Doomsday I am here to report that I have tested the 35-100mm Panny lens.  It is superb giving me a reach of 70-200mm and when I put the OMD-5 on the extra built in zoom I get a very clear 140-400mm zoom, absolutely amazing.The new book just out by David Busch on the OMD is also something that should be ordered with the camera lens combination.  As I stated previously the OMD owners manual is nothing but a waste of paper.  Cannot believe that Olympus put out a great camera with the worse owners manual I have ever experienced?Still have not found out much about a flash unit that is smaller than the camera and better than the flash unit that came with it, the only use for the included flash unit is very close up fill in flash.

These headphones were recommended by a website (can't remember which) as some of the best sounding under $20 and it lives up to that hype. The sound is really good, especially considering the less than $10 price tag. They're also very comfortable and seemingly well built.

This little system fits the bill perfectly.  It folds up nicely and can easily be stuffed in a travel bag to take on the go.  So far we only use this in battery operated mode and it has already provided us with hours of music without having to change the batteries.  The sound quality is what you'd expect for a compact speaker system.  This isn't a monster speaker system providing you with tons of bass.  If you want something like that you are going to need something that is larger and connects to a wall unit.  I would highly recommend this unit if you are looking for something relatively cheap, that you can use with your iPod to provide you with music while on the go.

$REVIEW.: I already had a Paperwhite on preorder when this case came up for review...perfect timing.  I chose the red which is a nice, rich color but the binding end area is brown so it clashes a bit, I found this odd. If you think it will bother you I would order the brown.  But I do like the fact that it looks like an old leather book, very cool.The unit fits securely within the four elastic bands but I struggled getting it in, I was actually surprised at how hard it was to get the elastic straps over the ends, almost like it was meant for something smaller, but once it was in it was a perfect fit. Because of that I don't think I will be able to put this cover on and take it off every day like I intended, I would have liked to be able to take it out of the cover for reading at night (for less weight) and put it back on to take with me during the day. Not that big of a deal leaving the cover on, it does have the benefit of shielding my husband from the light at night when the cover is on! I've never had a cover of this design so maybe it would loosen up over time?Just one side note, even though I did not read in the description any claims that the Verso would turn the Paperwhite on and off, when I first took it out of the package I could feel a magnetic pull on the edges keeping it closed so I thought for a moment that maybe it did; I feel that for the price of this cover it really should have that function.All in all this is a good, sturdy cover that will protect and secure your Kindle.

$REVIEW.: I bought this hoping that I'd be able to use it in the baby's room.  I wanted to start out playing white noise at night, and then eventually start using it to play music after the baby got older.  The sound quality is great, and it was easy to set up.  I like airplay devices - super convenient and extremely flexible.The problem with this device is that it only supports 802.11b/g wifi.  If you live in an apartment building with lots of neighbors, there's an awful lot of interference on the 2.4 GHz frequency range.  Every single time one of my neighbors turned on a microwave, the Soundlink Air would cut out.  This happened a lot, though much less at 2 in the morning.  I had a similar problem with an older Apple Airport Express receiver.  When I upgraded to a wireless-N airport receiver, the dropout problems went away.  Not an option with the SoundLink air.  Given how that the Soundlink Air is so expensive, I think it should have 5GHz Wireless-N networking.

$REVIEW.: While it is expensive, go with theB+W 62mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010version instead with the MRC coating.There are two aspects to a protective filter, one is the degree in which the filter does not give any ghosting, minimizes flare, while keeping an optically pure path.This and other multi-coated filters will do this fine, such as hoya, sigma, b+w (not tiffen, bower, and brand x)The next step is durability.I have several sigma filters, and while they are optically great, the coating on them is very fragile, i.e., they gets knicks in the coating from even a bit of dust it seems, maybe some wind blew a bit of sand, but very fragile.I have not had the couple hoyas long enough to tell, seem better than the sigmas in terms of durability, however from reviews i have read it is an issue.I did some research into the MRC coating that some of the B+W filters have, which the manufacturer claims is harder than glass. I have this same type of coating on a pair of eyeglasses and it is the first eyeglasses i have had that do not get scratched (over 2+ years).Basically, if you want the filter to still be in good shape over time, then get the hardened coating instead, which for this filter is theB+W 62mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010(Notice the MRC as part of the product name), it cost about $20 more, but what to do?
$review_summary.: Go for the B+W version with MRC instead

$REVIEW.: If you're looking for a cheap way to explore the world of VHF & UHF, these Baofengs are the ticket. I get great audio reports, and with the cable and free CHIRP software, programming is a breeze. These have a ton of features for the price. Heavy and solidly built too. I already dropped my other UV-82 (the 144/440 MHz model), and it didn't even faze it. The free headset they include is cheap, but what do you expect. Also, the charger stand can be a challenge sometimes. but hey - this is a monster radio for what Amazon sells it for. There's a local electronics store that wants $249.99. You would have to eat a whole bottle of stupid pills to pay that much.

$REVIEW.: I used this GPS in Minnesota in conjunction with my Garmin NuviGarmin n&uuml;vi 1490LMT 5-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Map & Traffic Updateswhich I really love as it comes with lifetime maps, lane assist with junction view, spoken street names and US and Canada maps, an ability to upload POIs (points of interest), multiple point routing etc.When I opened the box I was happy to see the huge screen, especially as I drive an SUV and like to keep the GPS on the passenger side
However, by default the screen just shows the same size of map as a 5 inch unit, so you have to zoom in to get a bigger view.Bluetooth has now become standard in higher end GPSes so this function is available in this Magellan too which can be pretty useful as it brings up your phone book on the screen.The advantages over the Garmin were- a built in AAA handbook, - one touch Favorites menu (in Garmin it takes 2-3 taps to get to Favorites), - will play an external video if you connect it through A/V which might work for an iPod etc

(I still have to try that function.) - Quickspell which grays out keys as you type in address - although that can also be frustrating sometimes
Overall entering addresses into Magellan was a little faster than Garmin as it brings up suggestions as you type rather than you having to click on "Done" after typing the first few letters of a city.It does have highway assist very similar to Garmin and multiple destination routing similar to Garmin but does not allow POI uploads
This is a useful feature in Garmin as I always update it with the latest and greatest for Starbucks, Target, and other retail stores or points of interest from websites

I was disappointed to not find it in Magellan.But the function of a GPS is mainly routing, and having tested it with my Garmin unit for traffic and routes with detours I thought Garmin did a better job of routing me around traffic
This feature is more useful on longer drives in cities you're not familiar with but even in my own city Garmin does help me somewhat

It is often delayed by 15 minutes though and that can make a huge difference in evening traffic patterns


Magellan has proved really disappointing so far in traffic assist, it always suggested different routes from Garmin and I tended to follow Magellan to test it out, which got me late on 2 separate days as it led me straight to heavy traffic areas

The traffic assist feature always comes with annoying ads which pop up in the center of your screen as the bigger screen allows bigger ads!Even without the traffic assist I usually prefer Garmin routing, although that can be pretty quirky too as sometimes it will lead you off a highway to inner city roads for no reason at all
Magellan seems just a little bit worse

It also says "Stay on the current route" way too many times, and sometimes it seems like you can do nothing but listen to the GPS

If you miss your route it does not say "recalculating" like Garmin so sometimes you don't even know that you missed a turn
That can be confusing! Magellan sometimes tends to tell you much quicker than Garmin when you have to take an exit (1 mile vs .8 miles usually for Garmin) so it can be helpful but overall I prefer Garmin more than Magellan.The mount is pretty ugly and also flimsy for such a big and heavy unit and makes the GPS hard to remove if you're leaving the car

Such a big screen also makes it more prone to damage if it falls off or to heat damage in really hot weather


A carrying case is really needed for this one but it does not come with.As some others have said, this is just a bigger GPS not a better one than many others
If you don't need the screen size, this GPS is just extra money for the same features.


$No. helps.: [6, 7] $review_summary.: Big screen the only advantage, mount is flimsy, traffic directions not too good. Still prefer Garmin.

$REVIEW.: I'm a proud owner of a few Canon digital SLRs, and the biggest gripe is that with the HD video, my shaky hands produces virtually unusable video. I've been eying up a shoulder rig for quite some time, but I couldn't get over the sticker shock of Zacuto products and was too lazy to go down the DIY road.The Cinevate Simplis Solo is a nice little simple shoulder rig. Getting it to fit me and my Canon 5dm2 was rather easy, despite the instructions being pretty disappointing. After a bit, there was an initial discomfort with the rig that I just chalked up to not having used a shoulder rig before.The rig did offer a decent improvement with filming but it wasn't as silky smooth as I had imagined they would be. It definitely helps, and for "run and gun" shooting, this would be nice. Since I do travel a lot, the rig was fairly easy to break down and put in my bag but it took up a decent amount of room in my bag.I do appreciate the modularity of the Cinevate system. Eventually, I could expand my rig to accommodate a larger camera, a viewfinder and other accessories. Granted, this will start to add up pricewise, but serious amateurs and budding filmmakers would like this system. I'm pleased with my Simplis Solo, something I really didn't plan on thinking. 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: I have owned a Canon 10D for about 3 yeas now and in that time have shot over 12,000 pictures at NASCAR Races, Railroad Photography, Other Sports and Waterfalls.  I only used 1 Memory Card in that camera the entire time, the 1GB Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash card.  I have never once lost a photo, or had an error to write to the card.  I do a lot of rugged hiking and my camera (while in the bag) has fell a few times and all the data was still there when I got home to put the pictures onto my computer.  When I shoot Multiple Shots...it takes 9 to fill up my Camera Buffer...the thing doesn't hesitate to write.  I can fire em all off, and then start shooting again seconds later with a completely clear buffer (they are decently fast cards).  The card can hold roughly 400 High/Fine JPEG on the 10D (pending ISO and other settings).  I am buying a 5D soon so will probably upgrade to a 2.0GB Sandisk Ultra II CF because when I travel I take loads of Photos.  And 1GB won't hold quite that many at 12.8MP...and I may start shooting RAW too.  I recommend Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash cards over anything else.  They are priced right, and work.
$SUMMARY.: Great Choice for Flash Memory

$REVIEW.: I was going to purchase this product but couldn't wait and went to Best Buy and picked up a similar cord for $17.  On the way home my husband needed to stop at Lowes so I went in and found another one, Phillips brand, for $7 so I picked it up too.  (Returned the one to Best Buy later.)I had my doubts because I'd done some googling beforehand.  Some said to expect poor sound quality.  Others said that you really should get an 'official' docking station and not use the headphone jack on the ipod as your interface to your reciever.  We have a Yamaha RX-V661 receiver and there are a lot of red and white thingy bobs on the back to choose from.  I picked phono at first and was feeling very disappointed.  The reviews were right, sound quality was awful.  But I wasn't ready to give up eventhough my husband decided to use the electric knife sharpener while I was trying to get this rigged up.  Anyways I plugged the red and white ends into the CD Audio In (you have to really push to get them in) and viola it worked!I think the sound quality is great.  The 6 foot cord allows me to have the ipod next to me so no remote control needed.  I can use the reciever remote to adjust the volume.  For 7 bucks I'm a happy camper.  I can't believe I waited so long.  It's great using your ipod music library on your home stereo.  I'm sure this product for $10 is a great buy.  I wouldn't hesitate.

$review_text.: Asus has done a good job in placing a functional computer inside a form factor so small, one can't really appreciate how small until holding it.  The screen is bright, the WiFi Internet works great, the headphone jack sound quality is comparable to any good MP3 player, and the Linux-derived operating system goes to great pains to function like an appliance.  There are rough edges peaking through in places, but anyone could pick up this unit and use it for Internet, office, or digital media playback.  The only caveat is that the small size compromises the screen resolution and keyboard size, and even users with laptop experience will fumble with the keys a few times.  Those wanting the ultimate mobile laptop at low cost will be pleased with this purchase, but users with large hands or difficulty reading small displays will want to wait for the next model with the 8.9" screen scheduled for release in the early summer.

I am trying to replace older cheaper speakers where my wiring is frayed


 My old speakers had a switch to turn on bass and it was impressive even at low volumes like 10 of 100

 These new speakers require cranking the volume up to about 80 of 100 before you even notice the bass.These draw power off the USB intead of having to run on batteries or AC, which is OK if you have ports free or buy a port replicator


Would I buy them again? No.

 It's about the size of a smartphone, with the camera lens in back in about the same place that a smartphone has its


 The front of the video camera is a touchscreen, with a single activation button beneath it.It's easy to use: turn on the camera and the screen shows what the lens sees

 Press the button, and a moment later, the recording starts
 Press the button again, and the recording stops
 To playback, press the review icon on the touchscreen, and you get the recordings

 When you sync the camera to a computer, you can copy the video files like a regular file (ie
drag and save) or you can use Kodak's sharing software, which if you give it your account and passwords, will share your videos to Facebook, YouTube, and the like.Videos are recorded in MPEG-4 format, which annoys me mildly because I would prefer not to use QuickTime to view them


 However, I really like the fact that the camera has its own dedicated USB connector, which slides sideways out of the camera -- no more lost cables!The video images when played back on a computer are good, though grainier than I'd expect from HD.

$review_text.: I reviewed the reviews before buying and it sounded like this device should work with an iPhone 4 in a case, but it does not. Maybe it depends on which case you have, but it does not work with the Speck case I have. The only way it even fits in the cradle is by hyper-extending the spring arms, and even then it holds the phone at an angle with a very tenuous grip. One bump and the phone falls out.

$REVIEW.: I love this camera


 It produces the most amazing pictures


 No noise, sharp, stunning colors

 I recently compared it to a Panasonic Lumix point and shoot, and the Panasonic came out the loser by a large margin
 My only problem with the 550 is that it gives me the low battery indicator light on freshly charged batteries


 This is very annoying
 I've found that the higher mah batteries tend to do better

 I've also recently invested in a high-end battery charger to make sure that the batteries I use in the Canon are fully charged (something I can't do with the cheapy chargers that typically come for free when you buy rechargeable batteries).My favorite setting: Manual, ISO 200, No flash


 If you hold the camera steady, you'll get amazing pictures indoors and outdoors.

The sound reproduction has clean highs, a smooth midrange and tight, punchy bass
Overall feel is neutral, without exaggerated highs or muddy bass

$review_text.: I have been searching for a replacement to theMicrosoft Trackball Explorer.  The Explorer is probably one of the most ergonomic, comfortable, and precise trackballs I have ever used.  I have 2 left that are functional, but they are approaching 8 years old.My search had brought me through Logitech's trackballs, but they were not as comfortable and lacked the scrollwheel.I was turned on to the Kensington Expert Mouse this last year and found it to be very precise, easy to use, but not as comfortable or natural feeling.I overlooked this 'mouse' for a year.  Recently I looked again.  I watched a video.  It dawned on me:  This could be what I was looking for!For the last couple days I have been using it non-stop.  For gaming, I missed having additional buttons to program.  This one only has two.  (This cost the product 1 star).  But, playing on it for nearly 2 hours with no pain had me sold.It is ergonomic.  Your hand rests naturally on top of the mouse and the buttons are at your thumb and ring or pinky finger.  The scroll-wheel is responsive and I do think it needs a little tweaking in the settings and some getting used to, but it is much more comfortable than the ribbed scroll-wheel of the Expert Mouse (which I am also fond of).I would like to see the return of theMicrosoft Trackball Explorer-- it is still champion.  But for travel and as a plausible alternative, this one is the only thing that has come close.  I am pleased with this purchase.Regards.

$REVIEW.: Tuning your car soundsystem is SIMPLE.  It should literally take no more than 5 minutes.  You basically turn the gain on the sub amp down to zero and turn off the sub on the deck as well.  Put the LP on the sub amp to around 125Hz and turn the boost on the sub down to 0.  You basically turn the sub off and tune the full range speakers 1st.  Tune them to sound crisp and turn them up as high as you can until they start to distort then back them off to just before the distortion.  Now your full range speakers are tuned.  It also helps to fade the system 1/3 toward the front (in other words, fade closer to the front than the rear).  THEN you tune the sub.  THE SUB IS THE LAST PART OF YOUR SYSTEM THAT YOU WILL TUNE.  Once the full ranges have been tuned to sound Crispy and tight, turn the sub on from the deck (I just put it at 1 from 0 (0 is sub off on my deck), THEN turn the gain up on the amp to your taste.  Then turn up the Bass Boost (on this amp it's called the Punch Boost).  My personal settings on my P-300 AFTER I tune the full range speakers to be crisp and clear with no distortion or popping (keep the bass and mids lower and the highs a little bit higher on the eq when tuning the full ranges) are at volume 30 with the P300-1 gain at 7, LP at 125Hz and Punch Boost maxed out, the settings slam!!!! and, the system sounds perfect!  It feels like I'm at a concert!!!!  Even when I turn the volume down to 20 or even 15, it is so balanced, full and just PERFECT.  I'm running a JVC KW-ADX830 Double Din DVD Receiver with Alpine SPS-500s in the front door and SPS-600s in the side back seat with a 10" Kicker Comp VX 4-Ohm 1200W Max Sub in Box.  It sounds so amazing.  I hope this helps those having a difficult time tuning their system.  After literally a lifetime of trying to figure this out, all it took was a co-worker friend of mine who is going to music engineering school to give me a couple of system tuning tips, and I can literally tune any system now in about 5 minutes using the steps outlined here.  I was afraid that since the P300-1 is only 300W at 2 Ohms that it wouldn't be enough to power this sub (1200W 10" Kicker CVX), but this little sub powers it without any issue at all, and I imagine would power a 2nd 10" sub nicely with power to spare.  It slams!  Shakes my whole car powering ONE 10 inch sub.  The best part is the quality build of the amp.  It's almost 3 years old and has been used daily, and it still works like it's brand new.

$REVIEW.: I was contemplating getting the 55", but I'm glad I went with the 50".  This thing is huge.  I love that you can control the brightness on the TV, and that it can automatically set the brightness based on the ambient light.  The base is pretty ugly, and I've seen more beautiful edges on other TVs.  The remote is quite ugly, and the backlighting on it is weak.  The user interface on the TV could use a lot of improvement.  Also, the position of the HDMI inputs is awkward on the side.  If you're mounting the TV, you will be able to see those cords pretty clearly.  Other than that, I have no complaints with the picture - everything that's 1080 is quite crisp.  If you don't have a receiver, the built-in audio is decent.Completely unrelated, and sadly prompted by a recent home break-in: always record the serial number of your TV and keep the box and manual.  It will help with warranty claims, theft, etc.

camera works very well but audio is a bit cumbersome


 Currently, audio only seems to work via Internet Explorer and you have to turn it on each time by going to the "Visitor" menu

 Audio isn't an option in Firefox/Chrome
 Also, audio doesn't work for the iphone app (b/c the camera broadcasts WMA audio which Apple apparently prohibits).Anyway, I think I can get by w/o the Audio but it'd be a great feature for those looking to use this as a baby monitor


If they can figure out a better audio solution I'd give it 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: Netgear is supposed to have a 5 year warranty (2 on the power supply).  I had one of these for about 18 months.  Over the last months it's been increasingly flaky, every week or two it just hangs and needs to be unplugged and started again.  It doesn't matter how much it's in use (it's done it when we've been on vacation with minimal network traffic).I called Netgear to get it replaced, but they told me that it's not meant to be plugged in all day, so they won't fix it.  Unless you actually unplug all your network equipement when you are not actively using it (I didn't think so), then I highly recommend avoiding Netgear products.*Update* I called later again and got to someone from a different call center and they actually sent me a replacement.  I actually forgot if I stopped using it because I just didn't trust the thing or if it broke again.  Hopefully/maybe several years later (the original review was written in January 2007) the product is better, but from the reviews it's not clear that they are.It's hard to get low-port-number and no-fan switches of good quality, but I have had much better luck with theHP Procurve 1810G-8 switchesI have.  HP also makes 16-port versions that I believe don't have fans that are more comparable to this Netgear (no management features, vlans, etc) -- for exampleHP Procurve 1410-16G. I've used those in the data center a few times when needing a cheap unmanaged reliable switch and it's what I'd get at home if I needed a 16-port switch again.

$review_text.: We have been using the first HT10DBS surge protector at home on a SONY KV-36XBR250 T.V. and other stereo equipment for years since they were new.  The surge protector is marked for each outlet of what is recommended be plugged in where and probably more for easy identification later if you need to unplug something.Recently, I purchased a second HT10DBS to plug in a XBR55HX950 and other newer equipment which only needs surge protection and NOT battery backup.  My thinking then and still is that the first one works well so I expect this new one to also do the job.Over the years we have had line surges at least twice while I have been home and heard the computer UPS complaining.  No problems with any of the equipment plugged into the HT10DBS straight from the wall so far.  I believe this is a solid product from Tripp Lite and would recommend to anyone who needs a good surge protector for their home theater.  Also, for a surge protector in my opinion it's rather attractive.  :-)If  I needed a third sometime in the future or if the one's we have showed signs of failing POTS or not filtering any longer I would gladly buy this product again.  If you need one I doubt you could go wrong with this one for the price.

$review_text.: EDIT 120816:  WARNING WARNING WARNING - Windows 8 Release to Manufacturers (RTM) Enterprise drivers do not work for the Acer Iconia.  You do not get the option to select a second touch screen.  (Actually, this seems likely to be a bug in Windows 8 to me.  Surely many people will have multiple touch screens attached?)  You cannot flip the orientation of either tablet individually. If you say extend the desktop, it mysteriously changes back to duplicated on its own when you exit the configuration screen.  Why did microsoft do this?  The drivers were working fine in the Customer Preview except that it said you wouldn't get the full pleasure of windows 8.  now i don't get any pleasure at all.Since I bought this dual touch tablet for Windows 8 testing and ultimately its use, I have a really expensive paperweight now.  Please Acer, provide drivers for the dual touch tablets in w8 asap!  You should also provide your keyboard and windows utilities that you did for windows 7.  Please rush now that the RTM is out.***************original review follows**************Windows 8 Customer Preview (free from Microsoft) finally gave me the excuse I was hunting for to justify buying this toy.  I saw some videos of the two working together on youtube (thanks to gameveda for posting them), and also some tips on how to easily get both touchscreens working as input devices.It is indeed working fairly well--far better than you would expect a so-called "beta" version to work, that is.  It has hung up a couple of times, though, so I'd recommend doing dual boot until the final Windows 8 comes out if you depend upon the Iconia as your primary machine.To be extra safe for the installation, you can use the built-in "eRecovery" utilities to create recovery DVD's (takes an external USB DVD-writer and 5 blank single density DVDs).  You can also order the media ready-made from Acer.  I also created the utilities and applications DVD.  That's a good thing because I plan on trying to install some of the Acer software in Windows 8!Microsoft could learn a little about handling multiple touch monitors from Acer.  For example, there is no way (that I've discovered) to use touch in Windows 8 to get windows from one screen to the other when they're stacked vertically like this.  Acer software adds two buttons on the upper right of every window, one of which, when you touch it, puts finger-friendly size buttons on the corners for resizing. The other button snaps the window to the other screen.  This button is also very convenient when using the mouse.[update 3/21/2012:  I've found that if I turn ON auto-hide [default is off] for the task bar, I can slide a window between monitors that are vertically stacked.  Just enough of the upper border shows on the other monitor to complete the movement if I'm careful with finger placement.  Better would be the Acer type buttons or a flick command when moving towards this edge.]Installation was easy, except that for some bizarre reason (like I said, Microsoft could take some lessons from Acer on multiple touch screen usage), the way that you identify touchscreens in Windows 8 requires you to press the ENTER KEY ON A KEYBOARD!?!?!?!  You touch the screen to show that it's a touch screen, but then the only way to move on to the next screen is to press enter!  Anyway, have a keyboard handy when setting up. :-)There seems to be some question about it in various reviews, but mine came with an external USB card reader.  Swapping out the memory forCorsair 8GB (2x 4GB) 1333mhz PC3-10666 204-pin DDR3 SODIMM Laptop Memory Kit CMSO8GX3M2A1333C9takes no tools.  It's probably not really necessary for most day to day usage, but memory is a real bargain right now and you never know what kind of applications you might want to try on this thing eventually!  My iconia did not come with bluetooth.CONS:  weight and battery life.Hmmm.  How will I justify getting the newer version with the "ultrabook" i7 ivy bridge chips?  Hmmm.  Maybe to run the final version of Windows 8 when it comes out? Hmmm.Edit 6/5/2012:  Installed W8 Release Preview.  Sliding in from the sides to get the "charms" or the thumbnails of open apps works much more easily now.  M/S fixed the first of the two requirements for the external keyboard during setup.  Now the second touch screen asks if it's a touch screen automatically after you touch the first.  However, you still need the kb to press enter on the second touchscreen to exit that configuration.  I never did get most of the Acer add-on running but didn't complain since they weren't really written for W8.  ACER, WE ARE READY FOR THESE NOW!  Particularly need the ability to move a window vertically between screens with your fingers rather than the mouse!

$review_text.: A lot of complaints on the scrolling about this mouse, but not a big deal.  I set the scrolling to the slowest speed and it works like a charm.  Tracking is also fine on the right setting: if you have it on the slowest setting, it is WAY too slow, and on the highest, it is a little unpredictable, but certainly usable. The best part about this mouse (if you install the free download from Targus) are the programmable thumb buttons.  On the Magic Mouse, there is no way to pull up expose, which is incredibly frustrating, but with one click you can easily get that on this Targus.  One other thing that is a little annoying is the scroll button: it can't be programed.  Again, something small, but it would be nice to have this feature.  For the cheep price and the expose feature, this mouse is well worth it; it is also feels better in the hand compared to a Mighty Mouse or Magic Mouse.  The Magic Mouse looks sexy, but does not deliver on function, this is a great substitute.

$review_text.: This is actually my second purchase of this for my wife. I had endless hassles with the holder falling down during a drive from the window. The original holder uses a suction action. With the power cable hanging from it, that makes it less stable on climate changes and a safety concern while driving. Not to mention, I have an LMT2555 so having it fall all the time makes it easier to break my GPS investment. This holder sits stable on top of the dashboard and somehow barely moves. It can rotate by control but doesn't do it during the drive. Also, this holder is stable. It's my second one so obviously I recommend it.
$SUMMARY.: Great product for the GARMIN user

$review_text.: All of our conference rooms are outfitted with BlueRigger HDMI cables. Two selling points with these:1. The plug ends fit down conduit surprisingly well. Smaller than your average HDMI plug end.2. The jacket is supple and smooth which makes pulling the cable through twists and turns pretty easy.At 35ft, I have yet to have had any type of transmission issue. We've seen a sync issue once, but it was the laptop, not the cable that was the issue. These are very good cables.

$review_text.: Pros:  Get lots of them.  Stick fairly well.Cons:  Could be "grippier".  While they stay closed when wrapped evenly around an item (the pressure to unwrap cannot overcome the grip), they do not stay closed well if there is force applied in other directions.  In other words, if the item being wrapped is unwieldy, they tend to come loose.  But no worries, just use more ties!!

$review_text.: The stand took longer to get to me.  But, I do believe it made it when they said it would.  I tryed to put my 7" tablet in the holders.  One of the bottom hooks broke off right away.  The hooks were plastic. I then tryed to plug the USB keyboard in and the end was to large for my tablet.  I wrote the company and they sent a email back said to mail it back and they would refund my money.  They contacted me right away.  I had no address to send it to.  I sent a email and never got the address.  So I kept it.  I figured it would cost half as much to send it back.  It would have been nice to have but it just did not work for me.

$review_text.: I purchased this camera for my wife and she is very pleased.  She had an older Casio but she wanted more zoom.  I read some of the professional reviews that said it did not do well at dusk without the flash but I did not find this to be true.  I have a Canon SD970 IS that I dearly love but this camera runs circles around it.  The flash is one of the best ever and the automatic stabilization is superior to anything I have ever used and I have been buying cameras since the 40s.  The wide angle lens is a nice plus.  Some years back to get all these same features I had to buy the camera body, then a bag full of lens along with an auxiliary flash, rolls and rolls of film and if I got a good shot I never knew it until days or weeks later, sadly some very special occasions were never properly recorded.Update 25 Dec 2010 with the recent price drop I had to order one for myself.

$REVIEW.: This is my second GPS, and the third in our family. The first is Maggie (yes, we name them) which is a Magellan GPS 315. Sort of a barebones unit but awfully reliable for a lot of years, it went with me pretty much every where. It wasn't until about 12 years of pretty heavy use that it began to feel long in the tooth. Next, a TomTom GPS for my wife (Tom, naturally) which she uses when she gets out and about, not often but necessary. Now, I figure I could use an upgrade to Maggie, and after some research decided an eTrex 20 would fill the bill nicely.Oh, it does. It does. "Journey" does everything I could've hoped for and lots more. Paperless geocaching? Yup. Downloadable maps? Sure. Savable tracks and routes so I can map trails? Absolutely. Fact is, there's so much this little (about 70% the size of Maggie) wonder widget can do, I'm kinda sneaking up on her various subtle features. Like the walk I did last night, which I looked at later and saw what the elevation profile looked like. Amazing what these things can do! Back in the day I used to dream of having a device that would do this stuff. Oh, there were such things, but they were bigger and heavier and usually they didn't bother with Mac compatibility. Garmin is now very Mac-friendly, and you should have no issues swapping data between your home devices and your GPS.I did mention the downloadable maps. Yes, you could buy Garmin's, and I'm sure they're wonderful and kept up to date, but a single trip to [...] will allow you to choose FREE downloadable maps. They're more-or-less up to date, though for my purpose a topo and a decent street map is all I need. Oh, if you're a hiker, you'll want "My Trails" which adds an overlay of many, many well-known (and not so well known!) hiking paths. I plan to contribute to that map, and right soon! And don't worry about running out of space for all those maps you'll be wanting; if you fill up the onboard memory, you can add a microSD card. Classy!Last spring a couple of friends and I went to Big South Fork to scope out some little-seen arches. Maggie just wasn't up to the trip, and entering all of the details and coordinates was a pain. Not so now with Journey. One-click and the waypoint is entered with all the pertinent info already attached. Geocaches are equally simple.Downsides? Well, the documentation is near-to-nonexistent. The manual, such as it is, you have to download off the device, then print if you want a hard copy. The screen is rather small, so if you're visually impaired, expect that you'll have to have a pair of readers with you. I always do anyway and don't find it a bother. The color and resolution is pretty good, so that helps. I can see the screen would be easily scratched, so a case is a good idea; my wife got me the Garmin-branded case which was on sale and fits like a glove. Oh, and speaking of gloves, it's not easy to work the buttons wearing gloves, but it's probably way easier than other such devices which use touch screens. Just my opinion. Finally, there is no proper compass&#8230;one which will give you your bearing when you're not moving. This is a feature on the more expensive eTrex 30, but as I always carry a compass in the field (you do too, don't you?) this isn't so much of an issue. Another item lacking, and I don't quite understand this, is a lanyard. Weirdly, there is a place you can put one, on the bottom of the unit, and the carrying case even has a place through which it can pass. But there's none included. Why not? Seems silly to me, and a cheap bit of insurance, as many times as I've dropped such things. Anyway, Maggie's old lanyard transferred easily enough and so a piece of her goes on with us...I'm going to rate this at 5 stars, because I think what Garmin has given us here is perhaps the ideal GPS for hiking. But I will be patient and see what quirks, if any, emerge in the coming months and I'll update it as I see fit. Right now, I'm only two hikes and a day's walk into my relationship with Journey, but if she keeps it up at this pace, I think I can safely say that this is just the start of a beautiful relationship.

$review_text.: Firstly, I'd like to start off the review with thanks from Amazon.com for the lightning deal. Practically, this was bought for a steal! If anyone wanted a Smart TV this holiday season, this would have been the right offer for them! Now, onward to the review.I have so much praise, but I have a wee bit of function-related negative comments about this TV. I'll begin with the positives.Clear, fluid, vivid, and producing rich colour and picture quality with the TruMotion feature always makes a win into my satisfaction! Transforming every little bit of what my Cable provider (Cablevision) pushes into my TV into impressive HD picture quality, I'm glad I made the switch from a 40&#34; HDTV which name isn't as great as its name (and I won't slander the company in any way.)Yes, there are so many useful apps built in and several more listed in the LG app store. At least it won't be the &#34;same old thing every time.&#34; The built-in apps, of which YouTube and the browser I use the most, definitely increase the usefulness of the TV and worth of other services like Amazon's very own Prime Instant Video! (Now it's worth it to be a prime member, eh?)So there were just three not-so-top things that concerned me, but it doesn't de-value of the product. One of them is simply browser lags and bugs with the cursor. Sometimes, if the latency becomes high enough while scrolling up or down, the pointer might go away until you restart the browser. Keeping in mind about the browser, you might be better off navigating with a USB Keyboard and a USB-Ethernet Extender because, for one, it can be a little annoying to control a Smart TV browser with a remote and you don't want to be so close to the screen to cause eye damage.) Finally, the LG app store doesn't seem like there are going to be a lot of updates coming along in favour for the LG Smart TV powered by Google TV (because, as we all know, the Google Play Store is ever-expanding and LG only makes it bigger.)So whether you see a lightning deal like this again or if you're just out there for a new Smart HDTV, this one makes the cut and shouldn't disappoint you. Great LG quality, great price... just don't rely on it as your gigantic smartphone and browser!P.S.: Haven't tested out Skype on it yet. Need to buy the LG-made camera. Only one other downside, but not necessarily a bad one.
$SUMMARY.: The Right Size, The Right Smart HDTV!

$REVIEW.: I tried these DVDs with little or no success with my Sony DRU-810A DVD drive


 It was driving me crazy so I initially gave up on them


 Then, I happened to try them with a Lite On DH20A4P drive and I've had nearly perfect success burning discs

 Maybe 1 out of 100 fails on me and that could be the burner's fault, I don't know
I went to the Sony web site and found that the drive was only compatible with certain media, and the list was very small

 I no longer blame the discs and would ask anyone having problems with this media to make sure their drive is compatible


 You wouldn't think that it matters, but it does

$review_text.: Lets say you're thinking about the Fujifilm F800EXR - chances are, you're interested in the wireless photo transfer ability. That's basically why this model was pushed out into the marketplace. Well, it does it well enough, if not a big clunky. Obviously the phone isn't equipped with any sort of wifi or cellular capability so it requires pairing with either a tablet or cellphone in order to actually transfer the photos.  In my eyes, that's only slightly easier than just taking out the SD card.Second, I'm a big "non-ideal lighting conditions" shooter. This is not the camera for you if you're taking pictures in non-sunny day environments. The pictures that the camera produces even at the base ISO100 are noisy.  Say goodbye to any sort of detail retention at the higher ISOs. My six year old Panasonic Lumix performed better than this camera in low-light scenarios (even with the Fuji scaled down to 12MP to match the Panasonic).For that fact alone, I'd suggest taking a look at the various Canon / Sony / Nikon equivalents before picking up this camera.However, if asked how it performs in a world where it's the only camera left in the world - it's not exactly bad... it's just that it doesn't have any outstanding features which make you say "That's why I want to pick up the Fuji." That being said, if you were just handed this camera with little exposure into the point-and-shoot photography world, you'd probably be perfectly happy with it's performance on the "auto" setting.

$REVIEW.: This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones.  I did quite a bit of research before buying.  I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that I could pair with my MOTOACTV and that would stay in place and be comfortable while running.  The big selling point on these for me was the extra fit options that I haven't seen with any other similar headphones.  There are three different sizes of ear buds, then three sizes of the Gecko pad things, plus a set of ear hooks.  I've used ear bud headphones before and have always found that with my small ear canals, either I can't find a small enough size to actually fit in the ear canal or it becomes painful after wearing them for more than 30 minutes or so.I put the small ear buds and small Gecko pads on these and they stay put through pretty much anything.  I've run using the ear hooks in addition for added security, but the bud has only loosened up in my left ear once so far.I feel pretty confident that these will be my go-to headphones from now on, whether sitting at work or working out.  These are extremely comfortable, have great sound (at least to me), and free me up from annoying headphone wires.  I've had no issues with the wire between the earpieces catching on my neck, clothes, or hair.  There is a little hook included with the package to tie up the wire a little if it ever becomes a problem, but so far once I put these on, I'm ready to go with no complaints.  ALso no trouble pairing with my MOTOACTV or HTC Thunderbolt.I would highly recommend these for any first-time Bluetooth-ers or anyone looking for a great set of wireless headphones.

A 20 second setup (just plug in the HDMI cables and the power cord) and you are done.  Nothing complicated here.  5 Stars for a fine product.[Be sure that you understand that we are talking about HDMI cable-connections here .  This isn't for coaxial or anything else, just HDMI cable]
$SUMMARY.: 2 TVs, 1 Cable Box...... this is the solution.

$REVIEW.: I was very happy when I received this hard case. The color is spot on for me. It's a pretty Tiffany Blue color. I was afraid about the rubberized part as I didn't want it to be like a silicone case, however, it just has a matte texture as opposed to a clear plastic case. The Apple logo does shine through the case as shown in the picture. It fits my laptop perfectly and I have no complaints.

$REVIEW.: I bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle


This application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner

The Plug received good reviews on a few MC forums so I had to try it.The noise isolation is OK, about as good as theKlipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphoneswith silicone mushroom-type seals

The photo of these Kosses is deceptive though, and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big

Not only does it snag on my snug-fitting Shoei each time I remove it, the sharp edges of the silver-colored ring also dig into my earlobes
(The Klipsch are similarly too long, but at least they have no sharp edges.) For any other application these are probably a good value for money.tl;dr if your helmet fits correctly, these won't
I'm returning them.

$REVIEW.: I had no problem installing a hard drive in the enclosure, but it would have been nice if the enclosure could have been opened without the use of a screwdriver.  The instructions could have been a little more thorough about getting the unit working.  I plugged it in, and my computer recognized new hardware and installed it and told me it was working properly.  Unfortunately, the drive was not recognized and assigned a drive letter.  I went online to the drive manufacturer's site and got instructions on "initializing" the drive.  This info really should have been included with the drive enclosure in my opinion.  Once I got it properly installed, the drive works great.  Quiet and cool.

$REVIEW.: These things are great.Set up was nice and simple. You have to charge the head set and it comes with a USB connector for this purpose. Plug it in, wait until the light is green, and you're good to go. I plugged in the little USB stub (side-note, supposedly Logitech shares signal on these usb connections so you only need one for mouse, keyboard, headphone, etc., I have never made that work yet, still trying) and the after powering on the headphones the connection was made in about 2-3 seconds. That's all I had to do. I tried it on two different machines and I've swapped from machine to machine with the power on. No issues.We're talking wireless, so the first thing I did was walk around the house while I recorded my voice. If moved down a floor and away from the stairs, I lost signal. I also lost signal when I went outside and closed the door. But within 50 feet, it was like I was sitting next to the computer or even just plugged in instead of wireless. Excellent signal. I also never noticed any weird static or signal loss while operating with the headphones the way I did with a previous set of wireless headphones I had.Sound quality is excellent. So good in fact, I've started using these to listen to music instead of my noise cancelling ear buds when I'm sitting at my computer (if my zune supported bluetooth I'd use them on the road too). I've used them to present a couple of times now and the sound quality from the microphone has been solid. I've heard the recordings and nothing dropped out. The mic has been as good as my tried & true Plantronics wired headset (which I'm keeping, just in case).Not that I would use these while out & about, but I went ahead and paired them to my Android phone. It was as easy as connecting the headset to the computer. It worked just as well as with the computers.The headset itself has a few controls for adjusting volume, advancing tracks and answering/hanging up the phone. I haven't tried the last option, but the others worked wonderfully. I've adjusted volume with all the computers and devices I've connected it to. I've used it to cycle through the songs I was listening to.Overall, this is a great device. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and it does it in a very simple, straight forward way. The ergonomics are nice. It works well. I'm very pleased to have this headset available for both work and leisure.

$review_text.: After our apartment was robbed we wanted an alarm system in our new house


But we didn't have a land line phone

The alarm companies had monitoring that used cellular technology but it added $15/month to the $30/month monitoring fee

LaserShield charges $19.95/month for monitoring and gives you the choice of internet monitoring or cellular monitoring for an additional $10/month


The only problem we had was that the internet interface device (they call it a Sparrow) initially had trouble signaling the monitoring center


LaserShield worked until that issue was corrected
The only feature I wish it had was the ability to accept inputs from the stand-alone alarm system already in the house

LaserShield uses infrared detectors that use radio to connect with a central unit

Optionally you can install a "pet shield" on the detection unit that prevents the scan from going below approximately waist high and thus limits the possibility that a pet will trigger the alarm
So far our cat has not triggered the alarm.

$REVIEW.: This Sony drive has been reliable, quiet, and quicker than I expected. I ran into a slight issue with the jumpers on the back of the drive. I made this drive the primary and my other CD R/W drive the slave. I also had to purchase a Sata to IDE converter to attach to the back of the Sony drive (older Dell only equipted with IDE). Once the jumpers were set correctly and the converter was installed everything worked fine. This drive comes barebones (no cables, documentation, ect.) That was surprising considering this is a Sony drive. But, for $20 no complaints here.

I partitioned it to use for two different backup applications: one which makes a complete "cloned" drive backup copy, and Apple's Time Machine for incremental data backups.Best feature (in my opinion) is how quiet this drive is compared to my older Seagate FreeAgent hard drives I have.

All the cut outs match up I swear the speakers are louder when watching youtube or other media. when tablet and keyboard are attached keyboard does slide towards the back of the case but nowhere near where the keyboard will come out. The leather is not as soft as a sofa but more like a car seat. I'd rather have a snap than a magnet, it has a magnet that looks like a snap. With the case closed inserting USB, sd and what not is much easier than when open, open holes almost line up but the case is loose enough that when things are inserted the holes either cover it or is soft enough not to put a lot of pressure on what's plugged in. I will be ordering a second one for my wife.

This version is no exception.  Everything you'd expect from one of the leading names in digital cameras.The screen is BIG, and the menus and onscreen information is clear and everything is very intuitive.  The picture quality is fantastic!  Crisp and hi res, with many options for size and quality.  The detail on some of my shots is simply astounding!The video capture is some of the best I've seen from a none dedicated camera.  The 640x480 @ 60 fps mode, is quite startling when you first see it.  The improved video capabilities is one of the main reasons I upgraded.The battery life seems very good.  Infact, I'd say it's a bit of an improvement over my last Elph.  I purchased an extra battery, so I could be charging one, while using the other.  I still haven't switched batteries yet :)Overall, very please.  This is a great, stylish, neat, full featured, camera!

$REVIEW.: WARNING:Be aware that the star-rating on this product may be deceptive because the early reviews come from the Amazon Vine Program, and some of those reviewers selected this to evaluate without comprehending what they were ordering and then gave the product bad reviews because of _their_ mistake (example, many missed that it was a PS/2 device, despite that being in the product title). Since those reviews reflect/create confusion, I will address some of those points in the "Appendix B" of this review.Be aware that if your keyboard and mouse have been purchased since the early 2000s (in some cases earlier), you probably want the USB version of a KVM switch, not a PS/2 version (such as this one), but check your connectors.----When I tried to use the product with my favorite keyboard, it rarely initialized correctly. I contacted Tech Support and they contacted the factory and they replied that that particular model keyboard was incompatible (see "Appendix A"). I was very impressed that I got a same-day response. However, undocumented incompatibility information, specific and generic, is a serious negative, especially since this keyboard has worked with a range of computers over the years, including one built in late 2010, and at least five other models of KVM switches (the current one I wanted to replace was purchased in 2004). Consequently, there was no reason to suspect that it wouldn't work with this switch.With another model of keyboard, this switch worked very quickly and reliably. Switching needs to be done without sending any spurious or partial signals to either computer. I have been using KVM switches since 1999 and my previous ones all had noticeable delays in performing the switch, and if you happened to move the mouse during this window, spurious signal would often be sent, causing the driver to lock up. This was such a common problem that the standard mouse drivers were modified to detect this situation and reset after several seconds of inactivity. I tested the switching speed by having monitors on both computers and only KM on the switch and activated the switch while moving the mouse. I saw no gap in the movement of the cursor, indicating near-instantaneous switching.This product uses the Control-Key as the hotkey, which I find more convenient than the Scroll-Lock hotkey for my previous KVM switches -- it is a smaller and easier hand movement from the keyboard. However, if you are in an environment where there are switches using other hot-keys, this is something to consider.Like most KVM switches, this has the capability to automatically cycle through the attached system. This is a feature primarily used for monitoring a group of servers with a KVM with more ports (4, 8, 16), but is inherited by this reduced chipset. Most people who need to monitor _two_ systems simultaneously simply add a second display and use the switch only for Keyboard-Mouse.Although this switch has lights to show you which computer your are connected to, you are likely to wind up positioning this switch out-of-sight. The problem, which it shares with many other switches, is that the connector for the display is on the front, creating inconvenient cable routing. My preferred solution is simply to have different wallpaper for the displays on the different computers, making the lights irrelevant  except in highly unusual circumstances. However, I have set up systems for people that wanted to be able to see the lights.The cable lengths here are appropriate for the typical setup. If you need a longer reach, PS/2 and VGA _extension_ cables are readily available from many sources (extension cables are M-F, not the M-M for cables between the computer and KVM device).----------Appendix AThe incompatible keyboard is an ergonomic specialty keyboard, the FlexPro (by KeyTronics, circa 1995-1998); the compatible one is from Dell (1999). I don't regard this as a problem with my FlexPro keyboard because I didn't have this problem with my previous KVM switches or when using the keyboard directly with the computer. Before reporting the problem, I had tested three copies of this keyboard model, and all had the same problem.The most common fault was to have the three keyboard status lights (NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock) persistently flashing, but also other incorrect combinations of the lights. I encountered various combinations of status lights other than the expected one of having only NumLock on, and all these meant that the keyboard was inoperable -- pressing the CapsLock and ScrollLock keys did not change the corresponding status lights, nor did pressing any other key cause it to be seen by the computer.The instructions that came with the KVM switch suggested unplugging the keyboard from the switch and unplugging the switch from the computer to attempt to get it to reset it correctly. Multiple attempts did not successfully initialize the keyboard, nor did a hard power cycle on the computer itself (disconnecting the power cord). Several times I wound up in frustration disconnecting the switch and connecting the keyboard and mouse directly to the computer until the next time I needed KVM functionality, at which time sometimes this KVM initialized properly.----------Appendix BIn many of the earlier reviews, you will see the misconception that PS/2 is little used because it was officially _declared_ obsolete (by Wintel "PC 2001"). In my most recent trip to a B&M; (Fry's), I checked what actually got shelf spaces as an indication of what was selling. There were roughly as many PS/2 KVM switches as USB KVM switches. And all the displayed motherboards had at least one PS/2 connector. Why the persistence of PS/2? First, there a people like me with favorite keyboards and mice that didn't get updated to a USB version: There was a burst of very creative ergonomic designs in the mid- and late-1990s that got undercut by "the big guys". Second, there are work places where security policy is to disallow all removable media on ordinary computers to prevent the removal of confidential information and/or the introduction of malware or "unpermitted" software. This is implemented by physically disabling _all_ USB connectors (external and MoBo). Third...Conversion between PS/2 and USB is a complicated issue. Example: you have a PS/2 switch but the second computer you need to connect to is a non-PS/2 computer, typically a laptop, netbook, nettop, HTPC or other micro format. The solution is an _active_ adapter, with one that puts a keyboard and mouse on a single USB port and typically costs about $10. Keyboards and mice from the early 2000s that came with USB connectors often also supported PS/2 via a simple _passive_ adapter that often came supplied (or could be purchased for $1-2). PS/2 and USB used very different signaling, and it was the electronics in the keyboard or mouse that detected which one the computer was using and then used that protocol. In more recent years, it can be hard to determine if the manufacturer simply stopped supplying the adapter or if the internal electronics have dropped that support for PS/2.If you have a PS/2-only keyboard and/or mouse, the simplest choice -- and more future-proof -- is to get a USB-based KVM switch and insert the _active_ adapter between the K/M and the switch. Alternatively, you could insert the _active_ adapter between the switch and the non-PS/2 computer.-- Douglas Moran

It file shared pictures fine


Mp4 videos off my phone uploaded fine as well but when I tried to play them via the hard drive access the files were not recognized

 I think seagate is on to something special with mobile storage and wireless file share capabilities

Its certainly the future but they are not quite there
The app to me was sloppy and if you are ocd about file organization this thing will drive you nuts
No deleting after upload or managing files such as moving naming

Simple modification would go a long way in the app


Im excited about the concept behind the product

But the mobile video play and app issues are a deal breaker for $200

$REVIEW.: I am constantly transporting files from my home office to my work office using a jumpstick. For years I've been fumbling around at the back of my home desktop, plugging the various peripherals into the slots in the back. Not easy to do when the CPU sits on the floor in the corner. When I finally decided enough was enough, I did some looking around, found the good reviews on this model, and figured I'd give it a try. I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner. Now I simply reach beside me, pop in my jumpstick, and away we go. It also is great to be able to leave all those other items plugged in all the time (label machine, camera cable, Ipod cable, etc., you know how they seem to multiply faster than available USB ports).The hub seems sturdy and I haven't had any problems with it in the 6 months I've had it.  I'm sure like most $20 products it has a limited life expectancy, but at that price, I'm not going to worry about it.

$review_text.: I bought the mSATA version of the Crucial M4 mostly for the form factor and have not been disappointed at all
I also bought it for the fact that it's one of, if not THE only mSATA SSD I know that doesn't use compression algorithms (a la SandForce)


 The Marvell controller here works great and Crucial/Micron have done a fantastic job with their firmware


 Just as I received it (about 2 weeks ago) they sent notice of an updated firmware that fixed most all extended use failures that people have been getting in the past


 I myself have not had a single problem

 As I said in the title, it may not max out the synthetic benchmark programs or have the fastest write specifications on paper but it does have one of the best reliability track records out there and it doesn't use any sort of super over-provisioning or compression to get the job done

 It also has one of the most attentive companies backing it and troubleshooting the problems that do arise, so that makes it a true winner in my book


 You won't be disappointed in the performance if you're upgrading from any standard platter based HDD
 Also, if you're looking for the small form factor and something to plug directly into a desktop motherboard or laptop to save space, it accomplishes that goal for you as well.For a little background on the hardware, it's been first used in an ASUS Crosshair III Formula motherboard in a SATA II socket through the Syba adapter

 Afterwards I transferred it over to a new build on the Maximus V Gene where it directly plugs into the mPCIE expansion bracket (also SATA II)

 For those interested, it does also work wonderfully of course in the SATA III sockets on the new build which allows for faster read speeds
 I however prefer the convenience of the direct motherboard interface and the fewer cables associated therewith
 My perception is that it does not suffer for being attached to a SATA II socket
 The response times are just as snappy and Windows 7 still grades it at 7.8 so I'm happy


 If you have questions or concerns, feel free to comment and I'll try to answer as best I can from my own experience.*******UPDATE ON 28-Oct-2012*******Well...

two days after the return window to Amazon, the drive decided to fail..

No warning, just suddenly a blank screen
 Upon reboot, the drive cannot be found


 It seems another reviewer here has the same problem with the most recent firmware revision

 The drive is no longer listed at all in the BIOS in any mode (IDE or AHCI) after a crash and hard reboot
 *SIGH*


 I'm just glad I kept my Raptor in it's original image condition (just a month old is all)


 Now I have to see how or if Crucial handles the RMA and whatnot

 Here's hoping my faith is not betrayed

 :-(*******UPDATE ON 31-Oct-2012*******I visited the Crucial forums after trying the tech support email
 I managed to find a "power cycle" reset method to allow the SSD to self correct
 It worked and I didn't have to follow through with an RMA


 The drive came back to life without any data loss thankfully and it's working just as well as it did before!  The issue I experienced was with the 01MG firmware revision
 It is known to Crucial/Micron and hopefully they are working on a fix
 I am glad they do actually support their products and that the community is active in finding fixes
 They did respond very quick to the support email I sent as well
 My faith in good companies held true!  =DHere are the links to those fixes for anyone who might also have a similar problem

 First is the official procedure from Crucial:forum.crucial.com/t5/Solid-State-Drives-SSD-Knowledge/Why-did-my-SSD-quot-disappear-quot-from-my-system/ta-p/65215Next is the procedure (slightly modified) that I used and worked quite well:forum.crucial.com/t5/Solid-State-Drives-SSD/How-I-fixed-my-M4-that-wouldn-t-detect-in-the-BIOS/td-p/110964

$review_text.: Does this device work as a firewire and usb hub? yes. Does the hard drive work? Yes.  This device's fan technology is unintelligent--meaning it does not appear to be based on any thermostat.  The fan kicks in even when not in use and even in a low temperature environment where it's not next to any other equipment.  It sounds like half the volume of a blow dryer on low.If you want a good drive, try the Lacie Quadra D2 drives. I have two Quadra D2 500GB drives and one BigDiskExtreme 600GB drive. You can stack them very nicely (although I buy thicker rubber separators so I have a half inch between them and below).  They're very quiet.Since removing my Mac Mini from being on top of a hard drive, I think its own fan has kicked in very rarely.  So that's another advantage of using a hard drive that's not designed to sit under a Mini.My Mac Mini is in my entertainment center, and after a year of listening to the noise, I finally said--enough is enough.  It's now my temporary USB drive for moving files between computers.

$review_text.: I tried these for birding but unless you need them for insects or butterflies there are better alternatives. I found the optics only fair for normal birding especially at a distance and sent these back and bought the Nikon Prostaff 8x25's and they work way better for general birding and they fit your hands better and the big plus is the Nikon's are waterproof. About the same price as these at $110.00. Nikon just beats Pentax when it comes to optics. The exit pupil is only 2.47mm on these which is the aperture(21mm)divided by the magnification(8.5x). This means the cone of light entering your eye is very narrow so they require very careful eye placement on the eyepieces making them fussy to use. The Nikon 8x25 Prostaff has a 3.1mm exit pupil making them way easier to place your eye over the eyepiece and way less fussy to use. This small exit pupil is what makes most compacts hard to use plus they let in less light making them dim at dusk. The Nikon Prostaff's are also brighter for that reason than the Pentax's. Get the Nikon's for birding and you won't be sorry.
$review_summary.: There are better alternatives for compact birding binoculars.

$review_text.: I looked around for a while before deciding to buy this cover


I wanted some protection for my Kindle but also didn't want to spend too much money

This mCover does the job and securely holds my Kindle for a lot less than what many of the other covers and sleeves go for, at the same level of protection.What the product images here don't show is that there is an elastic strap that loops from the back around the front to hold the cover shut

Nice touch: the front sports a groove for the strap, thus preventing the cover from opening accidentally (see my uploaded image)


The strap on my cover fits very tightly so at first it took me a few tries to actually get it to come out of the groove.One thing I am not at all sure about is whether this product is actually leather

While it says so here on Amazon as well as on the wrapper the cover comes in, the odor coming from it is VERY strong, plastic-y and headache-inducing

The markings on the cover also seem to be too regular to be real leather but I readily admit that I am unable to tell whether this is real or fake


If it is real leather it is loaded with all kinds of chemicals and I just hope that the smell will go away quickly because it does interfere with my reading pleasure.All in all I am ok with this cover but could very much do without the chemical smell - maybe this is simply a case of you-get-what-you-pay-for


If it weren't for the smell, I'd give it 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: A couple of days ago I decided to make the big leap from Palm (i.e. Handspring Visor) to PocketPC - and am I glad I did!  Not only is there the obvious parallel of going from black to color, but the ease of synching ALL of my necessary files (especially Outlook) without having to go through mediator interfaces (e.g. DataViz and Chapura) is fantastic.  All of the data comes through (not just truncated), and it is extremely legible.The third-party applications and data sources give it an enormous breath and functionality.  But the deciding factor for this particular model was:  no antenna to stick out, and yet both BlueTooth and Wi-Fi compatible.Have no doubt about purchasing this excellent productivity tool - you will not regret it!

$review_text.: I mean, not just manageable, but actually very easy.  Be sure to turn your phone off and give it a good wipe down with the provided microfiber cloth (not turning it off causes the screen to attract dust!).  The first one I applied (to my phone) practically flew one, the thing is hungry for screen...  It will devour the screen seamlessly as you peel back the first protective sticker.  Then peel back the second protective sticker, flawless.  It's so thin I can barely see that it is there.The second one of these I applied was on my girlfriends phone, which is slightly scratched.  We fought about four little particles of dust on her phone but using the supplied stickers we reached in and surgically removed them, pretty easy.  Once applied her scratches are no longer visible at all.What I really love about this product is it says Designed in the USA...  I know what you're thinking right... but Made in ... What?  Japan? It actually says material made in Japan.  Products from Japan always beat ones from China in my experience.  Quality stuff here.

$REVIEW.: I love this cover for my new Paperwhite


 I actually ordered a couple of aftermarket covers as well, and all three covers came the same day as my new Kindle
 I WANTED to like one that only cost 10 bucks or so ..

but in the end, this one won out


 It really is so much nicer than the aftermarket covers

 Color (I have purple) is beautiful, quality is impeccable, magnet feature works, and in short, it's just really really nice
 My ONLY "complaint" would be that the Amazon cover for the basic Kindle has a nice suede inside, so that you hold that when it's folded back and you are reading, whereas this one has a rougher fabric..
but really that is very minor
It's a great cover.

$REVIEW.: I'm surprised all the reviews so far for this photo frame are mostly negative

 It's not without its problems, but it's still relatively easy to use and actually a lot of fun

 There's both a "Quick Start Guide" plus a 29 page "User Guide"

 The frame is easier to use if you read the "User Guide", and consult it if you have problems

 But you also can just  push buttons on the remote, and usually get what you want


 The remote is not as sensitive as it could be

 Sometimes you have to repeatedly press buttons to get to the screen you want

 I'm not sure, however, if it's the remote itself, where you have it pointed, or the distance from the frame

 Still, there has never been a time yet when the right screen did not come up
 One very important thing to know--there are two menu screens

 When you hit the menu button, the "home" menu screen for photos, music and video management pops up

 This is the menu screen you will use the most

 But if you need the "setup menu" screen, just push the "menu" button again while the screen is on the "home" screen
 There is a "menu" button on the frame itself, along with a few other buttons, but  not all the buttons that are on the remote.Set up was easy
 You just take the frame out of the box, plug in the AC cord, and turn on the frame, with the on/off switch that is on the frame itself

 Before putting the frame down on a surface, however, make sure you EXTEND the adjustable stand


 It does extend, even though it first appear not to

 Just pull out the plastic piece on the bottom

 This keeps the frame from falling over

 You can also rotate the stand so the frame is vertical instead of horizontal
 But you also can use the remote to rotate pictures, too.How to get pictures on the frame?  E-mail is the easiest way and the most fun


(The frame only receives e-mails "within the continental USA".) There is an e-mail address on the back of the frame that you use
 (When you register your frame, you can change your e-mail address to one that you want.)  There are 60 picture downloads included with the frame, and you have 60 days to use them from the first time you get a photo e-mail, before they expire
 After that, you can buy picture packages
 There is a "Buy Photo Package" button on the "Photo Mail Inbox" screen, but I could not get the remote to click in that button

 I couldn't even get to the button
 If you can get to it, you can buy a package right there, using a virtual keyboard to type in your address and credit card info

 I went online to Pandigital to check on package prices


 It asks for your frame address before it lists prices
 My price list was:  100 Photos--$ 9.99, 400 Photos--$29.99, 700 Photos--$49.99

 According to Pandigital support, there are no expiration dates on any photo package you buy.We sent e-mails to the frame with both a PC and a Mac


 They all arrived in less than five minutes
 It's not hard to check your mail at all; there is a "Photo Mail" button right on the remote

 I guess, however, elderly people who are not use to using small remotes with arrows may have a problem

 The only solution to this would be if Pandigital had a frame that automatically sent all e-mailed photos right into the slideshow
 That would require an exclusive e-mail list, though, to keep spam from being downloaded, if there is spam for these devices
 You can block and unblock senders with this frame


 There is no "photo preview feature" with e-mailed photos, and you must download ALL photos in any e-mail you choose to open
 Hence, an e-mail with five photos counts as five e-mailed pictures, not one


 You can just delete an e-mail, too, without opening it


 Also, only successful downloads count as deductions from your photo package

Pictures must be in the JPEG format taken with a digital camera.Secure digital cards and flash drives are another way to acquire photos on the frame, as well as downloading photos directly from your computer

 A download USB cord is included


 At first, when I clicked in a picture at "My Pictures",  and clicked "send to", there was no Pandigital choice
 When I went to my Kodak  software, there was a Pandigital choice


 Then, when I went back to "My Pictures", the choice was there, too

 Pictures instantly went to the frame when using both the Kodak software and the Vista software

 You can pick and choose pictures, when you send them that way to the frame
 So, you can send a whole album or folder, and just pick what you want

 The same with memory cards

 I used an SD and that worked instantly in downloading pictures, and I could pick which ones I wanted


 I had problems with a flash drive, however

 It never would show there was a flash drive in the frame
 It turned out I had the drive in the wrong way!  I didn't even know it would go in the wrong way

 After I turned it around, I easily downloaded the pictures on it


You can easily delete pictures on the frame at any time
 And there are five folders on the frame you can use to sort your photos, and view different slide shows

 Unfortunately, you can't change the name of the folders, though.Music can also be sent to the frame, but they must be in the MP3 format

 Your iTunes library is not in that format
 Songs you buy from Amazon are in the MP3 format, and that's what I sucessfully sent to the frame using the USB cord


 (If you have Vista, go to "My Music", open the Amazon MP3 folder, click the song you want, and right click "send to" Pandigital.)  The funny thing is that not only the songs were downloaded, but so were the album covers
 Thus, when I did a slideshow after downloading the songs, there among the pictures of my nephew and his dog was Kenny Loggins!  You can even click in the album cover to play the song, instead of going to the menu and choosing the manage music button


 Deleting the album cover pictures won't delete the songs

 I guess someone could use this frame to display album covers
 They could put them all in one of the folders, so there were nothing but album covers in that folder
 You can adjust the volume of the music with the + and - buttons on the remote, but a kid might not find the volume high enough.Trying to download a video didn't work for me


 The frame only accepts JPEG videos taken with a digital camera, and that's what I thought my Kodak DX6490 took
 The video did download, but the frame said it was not a supported format, so the video would not play


 It turns out my Kodak uses .mov file format


Other features on this frame are a Wi-Fi connection with an adapter that is not included, and a clock with a stand-by and schedule modes, so you can program your slideshows.The remote has a "slideshow" button, and I had no problems with that
 I doubt an elderly person would have any problem using that button
 The slideshows are really pretty and cool looking


 The photos look great on this frame--they are very clear and the colors are very vivid
 I think this frame would be a great gift for any age group

 Even if an elderly person could not check their photo e-mail and download it, a younger person visiting them certainly could
 I think the 15" Panadigital frame might be better for elderly persons, though

 That would be the best size to get for someone who wants to display nature and wildlife pictures, too

 As I stated in the beginning, this frame is not without some problems, but it actually is a lot of fun

 As I write this, I have Kenny Loggins singing "I'm Alright" to a slideshow of my nephew doing goofy things at the beach
 But, alas, I deleted the photos of Mr
Loggins, even though he was also looking goofy on the album covers

 Maybe I should download the album covers again, and tell my nephew that's what he's going to look like when he gets older
:)

$REVIEW.: I have never owned a universal remote before I got the Logitech Harmony One Advanced Universal Remote, so using an advanced universal remote control was a new and exciting experience for me.Setting up the remote was easy. The remote comes with computer software, which makes it easy to set everything up. You enter in the brand and model number of all your devices, and the software downloads the necessary remote control codes from an online database, which is continually updated. The setup takes generally 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how complicated your multimedia system is. All this information is loaded onto the remote by an included USB cable.When configuring the remote, you can enter different activities, such as "Watch TV," "Play a DVD," etc. When you select an activity, the remote will turn on/off devices, change channels, or whatever it needs to do to set everything up for that activity, with one press of a button. It was a little tricky getting everything working together just right, but it just takes a little tweaking to make everything work together correctly. The setup guide is overall very user friendly.The remote feels very comfortable in my hand, no matter how far up I hold it. There is a touch screen at the top, which, among other things, lets you use any function of your remote that is not represented by an actual button on the lower part of the remote. My favorite part of the remote is  that you can create customized buttons on the touch screen for your favorite channels. The touch screen has a built in help feature, but really isn't necessary since the remote is very intuitive to use.Also, I like how the touch screen and lighted buttons "wake up" just by slightly shaking the remote, so you don't have to press a button first to see the remote light up in the dark. The remote has a built in rechargeable battery, and comes with a charger base, which provides a good place to keep the remote (rather than stuck under the couch cushions!).The only flaw I can think of is the remote does not work for RF devices, which is disappointing for an "advanced" remote control such as this. Overall, this remote is the perfect accessory for someone who has too many remote controls to manage.
$SUMMARY.: Taking control of your super interconnected multimedia machines!

$review_text.: I bought one of these at a big-box store in preparation for a three-day hotel stay with some friends

I wouldn't want it as my primary listening system at home, but it put the speakers in my laptop and iPod to shame, and worked exactly as advertised for a great low price.Obviously you're not going to get deep, rich bass out of this little thing, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it filled in the lower notes and kick drums

The volume wasn't enough to fill a room, but for a couple of people sitting around a table chatting and playing cards, it's adequate.It was plug-and-play in Windows XP for me; my laptop detected the speakers as a generic USB audio device and I didn't experience any of the problems the other reviewer mentioned with bursts of white noise.We used it on-and-off for three days, maybe 4-6 hours a day, and the batteries still had power when we left

Very happy with this purchase overall.

$review_text.: This product does what it says. The software is very easy to use and the recording quality is high. I used this with my MacBook Pro early 2010 model while recording onto an external USB drive and it was no problem and the computer did not overheat, although you should keep it ventilated. Setup was simple with the included wires and diagram. I had difficulty getting a signal from my cable box at first and tried to troubleshoot with the Elgato website. As it turns out, the problem was with my cable box and not the EYE TV. I have a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD from Time Warner Cable which as I understand is a very common DVR model. The problem that I had was that my box was plugged into my TV via HDMI at the same time as I was trying to connect it to the EYE TV and the box will only push the signal through one of two outputs (HDMI or component) at a time. This was easy to fix, I just had to unplug the HDMI from the cable box and reset the cable box with the EYE TV plugged in, and then it pushed the signal no problem.The IR blaster works as well, although I still haven't figured out how to get the remote to work.

$REVIEW.: The Diamond VC500 capture device is awesome!Load the driver program, open the program, plug in the device in the USB, connect to A/V outputs on a VCR or a DVD player, start to play your source (VHS or DVD) and you will see it on your computer screen and hear it through your audio card.  Then, when you see the scenes you want, press the record button on the device or on the program and you are capturing.The tool command on the program allows you to adjust picture capture quality and output mode (and quality).After years of handling videos by direct transfer from VCR to VCR in order to make a composite, now I can do the editing on my computer.  The files created can be used and edited directly in Windows Movie Maker (the device comes with another editing program, but I find WMM to be easier to use with a wider range of output files).As a person using clips from many movies in an educational setting to illustrate my topics, this device has made my life much easier -- and the quality of what I get is much, much better!!!!!And all of this for a price much less than the usual video-capture internal card.(and a hint - you can use this device with sources such as phonographs or tape decks to capture and edit the sound through your USB port without having to delve into the audio input ports on the back of your PC.)

Picture quality is great. 1 dead pixel, not in a bothersome location.On the specs, I e-mailed their tech support. The higher specs listed on their web site are correct, not the lower specs in the guide in the box. 500:1 contrast and 25ms response. The explanation is that their componenets are improving all of the time.I also found out that most of their 17 inch monitors use the same LCD. The only thing that paying for the speakers and such of the higher end models gets you is those bells and whistles. The picture quality is the same.I'd say quite a deal

$review_text.: The Corsair headphones produce good sound
 The bass is good but not real low


 The mids and highs come through clearly  I really like the volume control
 Corsair uses a wheel to raise and lower the sound

which makes it easy to quickly adjust the sound up and down
The microphone works well, most background noise is blocked out.The wireless connection is average at best


 I was able to walk about 25 feet before it started to break up.The headphones use a soft cloth, which is a nice touch.The build quality is questionable

I am not sure with they will hold up over time
 They do not feel sturdy to me
However, I did not reduce the rating for build quality because I have not had an issue.My issue with these headphones is they hurt my ears after 20 minutes

 I have tried adjusting but I cannot get them to be comfortable on my head
 I reduce the rating one star for this.

$REVIEW.: I originally bought this for use with the Raspberry Pi, and it works very well. It is great to leave the other USB port free for other uses, and to never worry about a mouse next to the keyboard ever again, because there is a touchpad built right in to the keyboard! And it honestly gives things a portable-style feel. :)In short, I can and do 'touch type' on both a desktop and mainly on notebook computers, but can work okay with a touch keyboard as well, and this one seems to be in between these two experiences. It is similar to using the really compact and... interesting chiclet keyboard style some netbooks used to ship with. It does take getting used to, such as accidentally pressing Del when Backspace was intended, the quotation key moved by the arrow keys, and an insert key placed awkwardly. Otherwise, with a few hours of getting used to working with it, it's acceptable to use. It just takes a little more time to get over accidents from being used to a 'real' keyboard, but it's nothing for this to lose stars over. It's to be expected in a keyboard this small!Outside of the layout, the feel of the keyboard is rather good considering the great price this sells for, offering two great products in one minute piece! However, don't expect ThinkPad or Apple quality out of these keys... think more of a really basic keyboard that needs TLC to work well. :) The touchpad is not multi-touch, though you can do a two-finger click to right-click on it (and if I remember right, a middle-click) and it has the standard two buttons on the bottom. The pad does work well for a mouse, but movement is rigid and doesn't have much speed and flow to it, like one of the trackpads from the 90s. Overall, it's usable and again, this is no reason for it to lose a star, considering GearHead had to crunch this feature into a small package. The cable is a nice length for it's size, and while it's not the lightest object, it is not heavy either. There are three subtlely-lit green LEDs that show caps, num, and scroll lock above the touchpad on the right, and they are okay--though not bright. This can be a great thing if you don't like much light from these, but can be bad if you need to know these keys have been pressed. Finally, (and I almost did think about subtracting a star for this), there's no stands (i.e. feet) to the keyboard.Overall, I think for the great price this is, due to the fact that it does type and work well with okay quality, and that it hooked up to Haiku, Gnu/Linux, and even Windows 8, this keyboard is not bad and earns a five-star rating in my opinion, and with a bit of TLC for it, I think it's a lovable keyboard you'll love to use in tight spaces or when you need it. :)

$REVIEW.: i mine cryptocurriences as a hobby, and as a result i run linux on most of my rigs. since it's easier to maintain the rigs if they are connected via ethernet, i needed a way to do so in areas of my home that were far from the router. this device will connect wireless-ly to your router, and then you can plug your computers into the ethernet ports and it will share the connection between all the connected devices.  my only complaint is that the signal strength seems very weak, and as a result my network speeds suffer. i have one of these in the garage and my router is in the room upstairs directly above it, so i had expected to get a better signal.
$review_summary.: works, but strength is weak and speeds suffer

$review_text.: Both my wife and I own a GPS.  Hers is a Garmin Nuvi 250W and mine is the Magellan 1470.  Both units are mounted on a portable friction mounts, hers on theGarmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for n&uuml;vi Series and StreetPilot C5XX Series GPS Navigators (C530, C550, and C580)and mine on the NAVGEAR universal dash mount.What I liked most about the NAVGEAR mount is that the 1470's mounting suction cup makes and maintains excellent contact with the mounting base so there is little risk of accidental release from the base.  When I want to release my GPS, the 1470 and the mounting base can be easily separated and then just as easily re-attached. They remain securely joined until I release them.What I don't like about the NAVGEAR mount is the lack of grip when using it on the dash. The lack of grip has resulted in constant risk of my GPS sliding across the dash or into my passenger's or my lap when making even a slightly hard turn and especially a sudden stop. I've had several experiences already where it literally flew across the dash and onto the floor. On the other hand, the grip on the Garmin friction mount has not once failed to hold in all but the most severe maneuvers and is by far superior to what the NAVGEAR offers.  The material used on the bottom of NAVGEAR feels less flexible/firmer and although slightly textured, somewhat smooth.  The material on the bottom of the Garmin mount feels somewhat softer and more pliable - almost slightly sticky.Bottom line - if you're considering the NAVGEAR ME201133 Universal Dash Mount for a Garmin Nuvi, spend the money on the Garmin friction mount noted above.  You will be much more satisfied.  For other GPS brands, the NAVGEAR mount may be a reasonable alternative although you will have to live with the constant risk of your GPS slipping and sliding across the dash and onto the floor unless you find a way to improve the grip.
$SUMMARY.: There is a better choice for Nuvi GPS units

$REVIEW.: I've been on a quest for a variety of headphones for tracking use in my little den of a self-proclaimed studio, now that my Panasonic HT450 cans are mostly ageing.The ATH-M30 is the lower-cost Audio-Technica pro headphone. I ended up buying PRO-6, and wanted to review those, but they don't seem to be available around here. I tried the ATH-M30 on at the shop and recall being quite impressed, especially for the price!Surprisingly, even these budget headsets deliver a tight mid-rangey punch that can help cut through a loud tracking room environment - no, they're not as hi-fi, but I think they help to hear clearer in certain situations. Plus the ear cups don't swivel all around or fold up like the 40 Series or the Panasonics, so the cans are easier to put on.The cable does have a 1/8&quot; end with a screw-on adapter, which I would chop off and replace with a 1/4&quot; plug instead. These phones retail for less than $100, which makes it easy to pick up a couple for a small studio.Brilliant stuff. Worth a go if you are looking for something decent that doesn't cost a bomb.
$SUMMARY.: EXCELLENT MID-RANGE HEADPHONES..

$review_text.: I was a little hesitant because of the low price but so far this battery works just fine.  Charge levels are accurate.  The battery will charge to 100% but it will take just a few more minutes for the green checkmark to appear.  That's not a problem.I was able to listen to 3 hours of internet radio using WiFi while mowing the yard and still had 47% battery life showing. That is a huge improvement over the standard battery.It is larger than the origal battery and comes with a replacement cover that fits well.  I ordered an otterbox case that accomodates the extended battery so it's well protected while outdoors.  I'm good with it.

$review_text.: I love this graphics tablet from Wacom, however it takes a lot of getting used to. I had a previous Wacom 440/B Blue basic hobby type tablet that I hardly used. When I really got into Photoshop it was obvious that I needed to upgrade my tablet. When I saw the Intous4 for about half the original price on Amazon I thought it would be a great upgrade.After spending several days configuring my new tablet, I am starting to get comfortable with all of the shortcut features of express keys and touch ring. It certainly takes awhile to get comfortable with the pen and find it is very sensitive. As an older senior citizen and not being as steady with my hands as someone who is more accustomed to fine detail, this is a big step up. I find I am starting to almost throw away any desire to switch to a mouse that comes with the tablet for regular normal activities. I think the mouse that comes with the Wacom is just fine. You have to calibrate all the setting to finally settle in on what works for you. I found a firmer setting in the pen setting works best for me. The pen becomes too sensitive when hovering near the tablet sometimes.I suggest purchasing this tablet and watching Terri Whites video that comes with the reviews further into the comments.

This battery is actually better and holds a charge longer than the battery that came with the camera. Definately a great investment and if you are thinking about buying this so you will have a back up battery I would buy two because if you are serious into photography I would reccommend having two spare batteries and two spare memory cards because you never know what you might run into or how many pictures your going to take.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to love this item. I like listening to music when I bike, in particular. The Belkin Wristband certainly fits fine about the wrist though it's not easy to remove the IPod itself when you need to charge it. I have a variety of charging systems but few allowed me to plug in the IPod while it was still on the wristband. The design that keeps it firmly in place also makes it hard to remove. I usually wedge my little "can" speaker through the loop of my handlebar bag, (and used to tuck the IPod inside the bag) but now I have the wire-to-speaker-to-wrist connection to contend with. Not good.My next step is to velcro the wrist band around the handlebar itself, which I'm sure will keep it nicely in place -- and prevent accidents like a recent one I had where speaker AND IPod bounced off and out of the bag and I ran right over them!. The IPod being attached to the band eliminates that concern: However this design was created for the wrist - not 'anywhere that's convenient' so I'm feeling like this IPod accessory simply isn't perfected yet if I'm only happy putting it directly on my bike. I know lots of IPod users walk around with wires dangling from their earbuds to where ever their IPod is. Maybe they'd be fine about being attached from ear to wrist. Me, I want a Bluetooth type of connection. As I said in the beginning, I love the idea of wearing my IPod and can easily see a future of Skyping with a simple glance at my wrist. However, I believe that should include a comfortable listening device/speaker system attached to my ear like the innocuous one that syncs to my Blackberry. Not a single wire or connection in sight.

$review_text.: I think getting a screen protector for the ipad may not be the most important thing (as opposed to say getting a cover)........if you do decide to put one on ....getting the right screen protector is paramount. You don't want one that reduces the screen sharpness nor give you any issues with reflection. That is definitely where the armor suite comes in. It is a great screen protector. Need to read the instructions and make sure you follow it. I had a slight issue in that I think I put too much moisture so some bubbles developed. I contacted customer support and inquired if I had just messed up but they assured me with clear details of how the bubbles are formed by excess moisture and will disappear. They requested I leave the device turned off for 24hrs or so. Also requested that I should contact them should it not clear.  Sure enough after a day or so it did. I was impressed with the customer service and the speed of getting back to me with clear and confident explanations as to the issue. I m definitely impressed with the quality of this product and the service offered. Added to that the price is just great compared to some of the competition. Definitely recommended without any reservations. I have ordered a armor suit product for my iPhone too.

$REVIEW.: I bought this unit from Amazon's Warehouse Deals for $94.85
It was brand new and had apparently been returned to Amazon from another customer because the shipping carton was damaged


(Warehouse Deals often has some incredible deals.)I wanted this unit to replace a 40 watt per channel Sony receiver/amplifier, model ST D390 that is kept in the bedroom


The Onkyo is 50 watts per channel but gives out a significantly superior quality sound than the Sony.With Sony SS-B3000 speakers (which I also got from Amazon's Warehouse Deals, brand new for $59 and change, reduced only because the shipping carton was damaged) and an Onkyo DX-C390 6-CD carousel player (also from Warehouse Deals), the 12 X 16 bedroom is filled with crystal clear sound and good bass

(16 gauge speaker wire for the speakers, and the Onkyo receiver/amplifier and Onkyo CD player connect so that the remote for the  TX-8222 can operate both -- and both have displays which can be dimmed, a must for a bedroom.)I can't say for sure if it's the speakers or the TX-8222 or what, but I am now hearing highs and details on classical CDs that I never heard before on two different stereo systems in the house (one of which has a $400 pair of JBL bookshelf speakers and a Harmon Kardon HK3370 receiver/amp)
Until I heard these details -- a singer's breath, the tinkling of bells, high notes on flutes, etc


-- I honestly thought I was just losing a certain range of my hearing (which I probably am as I'm in my mid-fifties, but apparently it's not as bad as I thought).I considered buying the Onkyo TX-8522 receiver/amplifier, which is rated at 100 watts per channel


Amazon Warehouse Deals has/had a few reduced to around $180, but when I saw that they had a TX-8222 for $85 less and with less bells and whistles -- which I don't need or want (the more bells and whistles the more that can go wrong) -- I couldn't resist

I don't need a lot of volume on the bedroom stereo, and 50 watts per channel is more than adequate.A very nice unit that took me about 15 minutes to connect and get powered up

(The FM reception is very good but I'm in a rural area and only listen to one station -- an FM college radio station -- so I can't say that I've really tested the reception.) I'm very pleased with my purchase, very very pleased.

Even on a table where other laser mice had problems this one performs like a champ.The keys on this keyboard are really nice to the touch.Cons:(None of these cons deserved reduced stars because they were never advertised as such.)NO MULTIMEDIA KEYS IN UBUNTU (except for volume).Except for the buttons the body of the mouse feels a little cheap not that that effects performance or says the mouse is going to break anytime soon, I just like the sturdiness of the keyboard and expected the same with mouse.To many backslash keys in awkward places.Hard to tell when keyboard is on or off (except for the obvious signs of course :) ).I would recommend buying this product, even if you are a linux user. Set works wonderfully, better than advertised.

$review_text.: So i purchased this and used it with my Harman Kardon Go Play system, sound quality is amazing! I used it fairly heavily the first week then it died, wouldn't pair or light up. I tested it on another ipod dock with the same results. I tried a few times again over the next couple of days with the same results, I figured it was dead.A month later i come across it in my junk drawer and decide to give it another shot, surprisingly it worked! it has been working ever since but i am treating it like its a newborn baby. I would suggest you remove it when not in use, as some devices continue to feed power to it and I suspect can burn it out or shorten its lifespan.In addition, every time I use it, I must go into my phones Bluetooth settings and manually pair the device. I have had the same results with the Galaxy S3, and Galaxy Note 2. It may be a phone issue, but i doubt it as I have plenty of other devices that will automatically pair when turned on and in range.If it had worked perfectly I would have given it a higher rating, but due to my experience, 3 stars is all i can honestly give.

$review_text.: I had a very positive reaction upon opening the box.  It is really refreshing to open a product and see the things you'd expect, like a user's manual and a CD.  And then to go to the manufacturer's website and see downloads, FAQs, and more manuals.  Right from the start, I felt like I had really gotten a deal -- like this used to be a $300 camera, and they put the love and attention into it that you'd put into selling a $300 camera.Now, some additional notes, as I got into the website and the camera.The manual didn't tell me where to find my serial number, and neither did the product registration page.  Neither the outside of the box nor the bottom of the camera indicated that the number shown there (which, inspection confirmed, was the same) was the "serial number" OR "S/N."  Oddly, the Nikon product registration page indicated that no manuals or updates were available, when that was obviously not true.I wish electronics manufacturers didn't find it necessary to use proprietary jacks and cables.  That includes this Nikon.  It would be a lot easier to pack for a trip, and there would be less risk of leaving an essential cable at home, if they would all just use the standard mini-USB cable.  One cable would handle everything.I installed the carrying strap, battery, and SDHC memory card.  Mine came with a 4GB class 4 SDHC memory card, but I replaced that with an 8GB class 10.  I had one lying around.  Not sure if that helped.  It didn't hurt.The Nikon website is not well organized.  For instance, I found myself at a page offering the answer to my question.  But I had not asked any questions.  The question being answered was, "Where can I download the latest Nikon software updates?"  That was a good question.  This page did not quite answer it.  It showed 20 different updates, with no indication of which, if any, applied to my particular camera.  Apparently I was supposed to load the included CD first, see what was on it, and infer that the only software applicable to me was whatever would be on the CD.  But even then, no dates were supplied:  I didn't see how I could tell whether the website's offerings were more recent than those on the CD.Starting with the CD, I looked first at the proffered ViewNX2 software.  I wasn't sure I needed it.  I had prior experience with unnecessary camera software.  I already had image editors I liked.  I figured out that the included recharger was just a transformer, from 120V AC to the USB input needed by the camera, so I put that part back in the box and just ran the USB cable directly from the computer to the camera.  As soon as I connected that, the camera turned on and let me set date and time.  I also got a dialog on the computer, offering to let me browse or import pictures, etc.  So I held off on installing ViewNX2 for now.That meant I didn't download any other updates.  There was one possible exception.  Somehow I found a webpage indicating that there was a firmware update for my camera.  But it wasn't applicable to Windows 7 nor to 64-bit operating systems.  So it wasn't useful in my case.Meanwhile, now that I had connected the cable, a light on the camera was flashing green.  The manual said this meant it was charging, and it would require 2.5 hours to charge a fully exhausted battery, and then the light would turn off.Other than that, I didn't go through the manual in detail at this point.  There was too much to learn.  Some of it was familiar from my previous camera; some was not.  It seemed more efficient to check back as I came up against specific questions.After charging the camera, I took some photos.  Excellent quality.  My previous camera was slow -- I would take a picture and then have to wait a couple of seconds before it was done saving it.  That was not an issue here.  (The SDHC card was the same one as in the previous camera.)  It saved the photos within, I think, less than a second.That was as far as I got at this point.  So far, I really like this little camera.Update, Dec. 1, 2013.  This camera has been good for me for 11 months now.  I wish it were easier to hold and use one-handed; sometimes I use it to take pictures of items indoors without a flash, and am holding a light in the other hand.  Also, for some reason, it is not transferring via cable; I have to pop out the memory card and put it into the computer each time I want to transfer pictures.  Not sure if that's a camera issue or a computer issue.  There are also times when I think it could do a better job of identifying the object of attention, in medium to low-light conditions, so as to bump up its shutter speed and avoid blurring.  Still glad I bought it.

$REVIEW.: When our Dell died, we decided to buy this for the new family computer

 For our needs (MS Office, internet, light kids' games), this is perfect
 We plugged our existing monitor and ethernet cable in, and are happily using Windows 7.What's good:- I gave this computer five stars at this price point


 It comes with Windows 7,  a suprisingly fast processor, 4 GB DDR2 ram, a dvd drive/burner, a wide variety of memory chip readers, and at least a 750 gig hard drive


 As with some of the other reviewers, mine shipped with a 1 terrabyte drive (920 GB formatted), but since the technical specs say a 750 GB drive, I don't think you can count on getting the bigger one.- As a new Windows 7 user, I'm impressed


 Windows 7 is actually pretty cool.- The computer is fast as lightning with Word and Explorer, although some of that may be that I haven't had time to install all of the drivers and apps I had on the last computer.What could be better:- The 1831-07 doesn't have a top of the line video card, so it doesn't make a great gaming station.- Moreover, although the box is big and roomy, the power supply is a little weak, and there is no cooling fan, so if you were inclined to upgrade, you would need to put in a new power supply/fan at the very least


 It's fairly plastic-y, so I'm treating it more gingerly than I did the old dell battleship, but it looks nice.- Connectivity could have been better

 There are only 6 usb ports, regular (rather than fast) ethernet, and no firewire or ESata ports
 For home use, that's enough, since my cable modem can't go much faster than regular ethernet, and you can always add a faster connection port by adding a card


 6 usb ports is barely enough


 The keyboard and mouse take two, plus we have a usb printer, webcam, and backup drive
 That's five devices I would prefer to plug into the back of the machine, to avoid the risk of kicking and breaking one of the front ports, but their are only four rear usb ports

 I may end up adding a usb hub.- The keyboard feels pretty flimsy


 I kept my Dell keyboard and mouse, and saved the emachines versions as backups.

$REVIEW.: Applying any screen protector can be a challenge, however this one was particularly difficult for my Nexus 7.  They made the protector almost exactly the same size as the screen which for me made it virtually impossible to align it starting at the top and  having it end up straight at the bottom.  No matter what I did I ended up having it hang over the side edge of the screen on one side or the other.  After several tries I ended up with enough dust getting under the protector that I finally gave up.  I realize that you want to completely cover the whole screen as best as possible but just 1/16 of an inch of leeway on all sides would have made it much easier to apply.

$review_text.: It's a great universal remote, I love using its learning ability to set it up, and the lighting function is indispensable in the dark. However, my complaint is that it sometimes just doesn't properly learn, no matter what. Two issues I'm having:#1: when I'm in AUX mode, I couldn't set up the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons to change the volume on my audio device, no matter what, even though I could do it perfectly in AUD mode. Makes no sense to me. Maybe I'm supposed to use the Volume &#34;Punch Through&#34; feature, but that seems like an unnecessary hassle. If I want a button to learn and do something, it should just do what I tell it to (which happens 99% of the time, but fails mysteriously in this case).#2: in AUX mode, many of the directional commands don't work when I press the button once, I have to press them twice, I can't figure out why. Maybe it's not fair of me to blame this on this remote control, because it might work if I press the button repeatedly on the original remote control when learning (a way of changing the button behavior, as mentioned in the manual). I'll try that out and rewrite this review if necessary.

To me, that will completely skew the reviews for this system, which is just ok, at best, as many people will do just about anything for a freebie.We returned the product as we couldn't get our photo-output anywhere near as nice as the ad claims. The background is not white, but slightly gray, and the bulb does not seem to give one a 'daylight' output at all. The whole set-up also seems rather cheap/cheesy for the price.

This company decided to list four completely different converters as different "sizes" under the same Amazon product page, so you'll get reviews for all the different models in the same review section. Most reviews are for the VGA to HDMI converter. This review is for the RCA to HDMI converter.The RCA to HDMI converter did not work for me, trying to connect my Wii to my DVI monitor with this product and an HDMI to DVI cable. The HDMI to DVI cable works, as I currently use it to connect my computer (HDMI output) to my monitor, but when trying to connect my Wii to it, the monitor would flicker every few seconds with a very distorted image resembling nothing discernible.Also, the 720P/1080P button-switch would not respond after one press. The light changed from red to green (signaling a change from 720P to 1080P), but would not change back.

 Alas, it was


 The dock works fine so long as you are playing your music loud

 At softer volumes, such that you would have while listening to music in your room, there is an incredible annoying buzz/ hum / feedback / interference coming from the speakers


 The hum is so loud as to render this dock useless for all quiet listening
 I am sure it would be fine at the beach, outdoors or cranked up at a small party, but for the price charged, I'd pass


 I am now in the process of looking for something else

$REVIEW.: I usually purchase a different brand, but for the price and because you get three protectors in the pack, I took a chance on these.  Very glad I did!  It doesn't say it in the description, but it comes with tape to use to remove dust which was very helpful.  It also comes with a cloth to wipe the screen before applying and a cardboard bubble scraper card.  I found the card was not as effective as the plastic kind I'm used to using because the edge was not hard enough. Not a big deal, tho, as you can use anything with an edge (credit card, fingernail, etc) to remove the bubbles.  It went on pretty easily and fits the iPod perfectly.  The holes for the camera and home button are an accurate fit. I had no problem removing all bubbles and only had one tiny dust speck left after I was done, but that's user error and not a product flaw.  It doesn't resist fingerprints at all, but I really didn't expect it to.  For that, you want to get a matte protector, but they take away from the screen's clarity whereas this one doesn't at all.  In fact, you can't even tell there's a protector on there.  It's easy enough to wipe away the fingerprints with any soft cloth/material, so that's not a big deal to me.  I've done it a million times with my shirt and it hasn't harmed the protector.  Touch response is not affected, either.  When applying, leave the top protective layer of film on while scraping out the bubbles so you don't mess up the actual protector underneath.  As you do this, it will look like you're scratching it, but the marks are only on the protective layer.  When done getting the bubbles out, remove the protective film layer and you're good to go.  The directions are pretty straight forward making the application easy.  At first it will attract some dust until you use it for a few hours so don't be alarmed thinking this is a permanent thing.  I love that you get three in a pack in case you do mess up or if you ever want to replace one. Would definitely recommend and the price is great.  Shipping had no problems - the seller was Tech Armor and it was fulfilled by Amazon.

$REVIEW.: This works like a charm on windows 7 (32 bit and 64bit ) and XP. No drivers or installation required. Just plug in and windows does the rest. The speed is great. Works at great speeds to distances of 140feet which i currently use for printers in a warehouse. It is really a great item that helps get away from using serial cables.

$REVIEW.: This switch because of the sometimes inefficient switching compared to the newerViewHD Prosumer 3D HDMI 4x2 True Matrix Full Size Metal Jacket Constructionis alot better..My Review of the new ViewHD Prosumer: 5 STARI returned the ViewHD Premium 3D HDMI 4x2 Matrix v1.3 for the ViewHD Prosumer 3D HDMI 4x2 True Matrix and I could not be happier. The switcher works better than the original and works flawlessly with my PS3, Verizon Fios Box, and my PC. I have one output going to Tv for Tv Audio and one to my Receiver so I can watch Tv with Tv Audio and play a Game on PC or vice Versa. The one thing I did determine though I had to first change HMDI Inputs (switch from one to the other and back) on my Vizio HD Tv so that it could resync to the new switcher or you will get no video or audio this is because HDMI devices have there own E-DID signature.1. Switcher switches better and more efficiently everytime. (Note it's best to press both outputs you want when switching as it is an electronic switcher/splitter so if I want input A1 and input B2 I will press them in order A1 and B2 and it will switch efficiently. Do not press just the one button at a time as it's a Matrix switcher and wants both inputs to be selected.)2. I have not had a single audio drop out on me so that informs me that the device previous reviewer is using is the problem I have mine hooked up to a Vizio Tv for one output and the other is hooked up to a new Samsung E-5500W with wireless rear speaker hookup.3. The only time I have about a 3-5 second switching delay is if I have my input set as a splitter so I am actually on A1 and B1 the same input than if I turn on one of the devices the output is connected to the device outputs will lose timing for a few seconds while the devices sync to the E-DID signal. This has to be expected for HDMI devices and ONLY happens if on same input and one of the device that it outputs to is turned on.The only issue I have seen is my Tv will quit syncing with the receiver itself but that is the PC HDMI Audio output issue and I will have to send a good strong audio signal to trigger it again like running the demo Helicopter virtual test or something like that to activate it but that ONLY happens on the PC never to the PS3 or the Verizon Box so that is my PC and Audio out issue. So if you are using HDMI audio out only for the PC and not for video this may happen at times but just start a new audio and that will usually get it resynced.My setup is quite unusual and if it works for me it should work great for you.A output HDMI to Samsung Home Theatre SystemB output HDMI to Vizio 32" TvInput 1 = HMDI from PCInput 2 = HMDI from Verizon Fios BoxInput 3 = HDMI from PS3Now I often will watch Tv with audio going to Tv only and my PC sending Audio only to my Receiver hence why I say I have a strange setup and so I will watch a Tv Show on PC Audio only and still have Audio from my PC going to the Samsung Receiver. I will simply press A1 and B2 it will switch in about 3-5 seconds and works! With only Audio from PC to Receiver. I had a heck of a time getting this to switch in the ViewHD Premium! So this switcher will do the job for you reliably!
$SUMMARY.: Good Switch but the ViewHD Prosumer 3D HDMI 4x2 True Matrix Full Size Metal Jacket Construction is even BETTER!

My new ipad's cover actually looks better than when I had my two old ipads covered at the mall.  They recently upped the prices, so I figured there was no harm in giving skinomi a try.  The kit was very useful.  Even after you put the cover (front back AND buttons), you can use the cleaning cloth and spray to clean your ipad safely.  A nice bonus!  I would definitely use Skinomi from now on for all my devices.

$review_text.: One problem with the way these 3rd party listings are done is that one seller can create a page and then another seller can jump on and list their product under the same listing, even if it isn't the same exact brand or quality
You also have the original creator of the page change the quality of their product at some point and leave it under the same listing

This is done for a variety of reasons, not all of which are nefarious.We buy a lot of different electronics for different businesses, so we have ordered many times from different sellers under the same listing
And since Amazon will not differentiate reviews based on the actual seller, we are going to try and collect reviews of items from specific sellers

If we ordered the item, we will note it
If we collect the information from another reviewer, we will note that as well
Lastly, we'll put the date of the purchase or posting of the original review


Hopefully this will help buyers under this listing determine the proper item AND seller to purchase.The star rating will go up or down based on how many good or bad products show up overall.Important Note: It is still possible that a seller may change their product at any time, even after a review is posted, so keep that in mind

You are most likely to receive the product matching the review if order one that is FULFILLED BY AMAZON
This is because sellers will generally send in large quantities to the Amazon warehouse at one time.------------2/14 Seller: Cable-Mix - Ordered by us


Bulk packaging polybagged


25FT
Gold Connectors
Appears to be 28AWG

Black Cable w/ Black/Striped Connectors


Had problems with highest resolutions....


This listing is a good example of another problem where a seller will list a high quality item to get the rating up, and then change the listing to a lower quality product

We have ordered from this listing many times before, and I would rate the quality of the cable as 5 Stars, Excellent
However, the last few orders we placed for this listing have been poor quality


It's such a huge difference that I'm surprised they would go that far down in grade

Also, this was a listing for 25FT HDMI cables for the longest time, but as of this review, it is for different lengths and quantities
Seeing as how all the original reviews were for 25FT cables of a certain grade, it's really rather underhanded to completely change it to something else


This seller was one of our top suppliers, on Amazon and elsewhere, but I doubt we will continue to order from them in the future
Beware this one.

$review_text.: I really like this case, but I don't think it will last long.  I use my Kindle sparingly, so far I've read one book on it and half of another in the 3 months I've had it.  The problem with the case I have noticed is that the fake suede interior is starting to separate from the rest of the case, leaving weird looking bubbles in the fabric.  Also, the tab that holds the two pieces closed is starting to fall apart.  In fact the tab started to come apart just two days after getting the case.  I'm still using it for now, just because it was the cheapest option for Kindle jackets, however I'm going to have to replace it at some point.

$review_text.: I'm a club DJ and have always used over-the-ears for work, but in-ear for play.I bought these about 2-3 months ago.I had conducted extensive research into "mid-grade," in-ear, ear-bud type earphones.  I found that Shure, Ety, and UE were at the top of the review lists.After careful consideration of sound quality, noise isolation, looks, and durability, I went with the Super.Fi 4Pros:They look sharp, and they are the smallest in the UE line-up.  I'm not a fan of large earphones (I sometime sleep with them on)The sound quality is great.  After they are "broke-in" they sound superb in the mid and high tones.  The lows are lacking.I know how to set an EQ and how to sound test equipment--point black, if you like any kind of R&B;, Hip-Hop, Electronic/Dance music, you'll want something with a little more "thump"They come with a multitude of earpieces (I prefer the double flange)Cons:Now, the reason for the 2-star rating:The lows suffer--really!  I've gotten clearer, punchier,  bass response for a $20 pair of Sony buds.The construction is cheep, wait, I meant CHEAP!  The wires are "angle-hair thin" and the connections are thrown together.THE KICKER:  My left side shorted out after three weeks--Three Weeks!When I contacted the company they were of no help. The "Service Rep" I spoke with treated me very disrespectfully, and didn't seem at all concerned that the "earphones of the stars" went bust inside of a month.I told them I wanted a refund, and sent them the goods with a receipt.  They said no, and then tried to sell me another pair for twice the original price. When I said "hell no," they agreed to send a replacement pair (I had to pay the shipping--are you kidding me?)All-in-all I would never again buy anything from this company. I don't care how recommended some of their products are.I'm all-about customer service.THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU ULESS YOU HAVE A RECORD DEAL!I don't know why they got into the retail market

$REVIEW.: I've always built my own gaming machines, but for the wife & kids, this one fits the bill perfectly.  It's very cheap, hard to build something decent yourself at this price.  Small model, saves space on the desk, which is always a plus.  Good enough hardward for browsing, casual gaming ( such as yahoo games) and light application use.As with most name brand machines, you can't do much upgrading to it, most of the parts are specifically made for them, so you can replace anything, and with the small form, you can add anything internally.  Though for most common use, the specs that's already on the machine is plenty.One common problem with all name brand machines - Junkware.  They preload a whole bunch of stuff on these machines that makes the start and overall running very slow, takes you a bit of time to go in and uninstall everything.  You can consider using norton 360 and use that to remove all the un-necessary startup programs.Wanted to take out 1/2 a star for this issue below:Keyboard & mouse, the 2pcs that comes with the machine is really poor quality, makes a 60wpm typer go 40wpm. Though it's understandable @ $399 retail price, it's hard to justify including a nice set of KB & Mouse.  Instead of including something that very few will use and makes the machine look bad, rather they just exclude it completely, only creates extra waste.

$review_text.: I'm using this SSD for a MacBook Pro, and the 512GB capacity makes it an ideal size for speed and portability

Since I already had a backup drive, transferring the data to the new SSD had only the minimal cost for software; in this case, Carbon Copy Cloner


(The Buffalo Mini-Station offered outstanding reliability and decent speed.) Among the advantages:- Boot time was a mere twenty seconds, and speed on video applications was easily halved.- Noticeably lower heat, even when performing demanding video applications.- While TRIM support is standard with Windows, it isn't with Mac SSDs


However, the donate-ware Trim Enabler is mandatory for Mac users.- Initially, some users may find that boot times may be as long as a minute; however, if you choose the Startup Disk in System Preferences, boot time is quite fast

Regardless, I sleep my MBP nearly always.And there are disadvantages:- SSDs are three times the price of traditional drives under the best situation.- Installation is relatively easy, but be aware that this Crucial SSD may have to be installed upside-down.Finally, I suggest you avoid FedEx SmartPost unless you aren't waiting for your package


Shipping may be free, but it's SmartPost is disturbingly slow.

(I say "actually" because I have 3 other motherboards and they all fail to boot from the USB flash drive despite having 'boot from USB' support in the BIOS.)* It seems to work just fine. I have had no stability problems at all with  the default settings.* Gigabit Ethernet, sound, and everything work ootb on Linux Ubuntu 12. With Vista it required the supplied driver CD - and works fine too.Con:* It only controls a single fan. :-(  I bought a case from Amazon that had 2 fans - so one of the fans screams at full speed all the time. It's kinda loud and I feel bad about that. If anyone has a solution to that please post :-)
$SUMMARY.: Only controls a single fan

$REVIEW.: I got this lens for my full-frame camera (5D), and it's a great lens to get into wide angle photography - sharp and versatile, plus it's very nicely priced for an L lens.  Be aware that the crop factor of APS sensor cameras makes this lens more of a 27-64mm.  If you have one of these cameras and you really want to have ultra wide-angle capability, you might be better off with something like Canon's EF-S 10-22mm.
$SUMMARY.: Great wide angle range.

$REVIEW.: With great anticipation and enthusiasm I purchased this 46 inch 3D Panasonic which arrived just a few days ago. Firstly let me point out that the Panasonic replaced a SONY XBR television I purchased a few years ago (and a tough act to follow) and was deeply in love with. On setting up the Panasonic I played around with the various video settings and settled on the "Vivid" choice which somewhat brightens the colors making it more to my liking. All the way through I was extremely disappointed with the picture on the Panasonic finding it dull and lifeless. The reds, blues  and greens were all quite muted in color and I do admit that I prefer perhaps somewhat exaggerated somewhat vivid images. The whites were grey and despite all my attempts to correct this tweaking the video settings I was unable to. Interestingly, using the "Brightness" control did nothing at all to the picture as if it wasn't working at all. I saw little to no difference moving the brightness all the way down to all the way up. In addition, I had a similar experience with the "Color" control where it caused little discernible difference from all the way down to all the way up. It was as if these controls weren't working at all.  The 3D glasses were on back order so I never had a chance to sample the 3D, deciding instead to return the TV as quickly as possible. The first flat screen TV I ever purchased (about 10 years ago) was a 42 inch Panasonic Plasma 720p which I was quite satisfied with. In addition,about 2 years ago I purchased another plasma from Panasonic from the G25 series in my opinion performed substantially better then the current ST30 series. As I said before, I quickly decided to return the TV so I will be back to the drawing board to choose my first 3D television. I plan on first looking at the Samsung and SONY LED sets.
$SUMMARY.: Very, very disappointed.

At first I thought there may be have a slight audio delay, but now I don't seem to notice that.Knowing something like this exists saved me from buying a new audio system like a sound-bar for this TV/room, as now I can use my old hardware with the new TV, so this is a very handy device.

$REVIEW.: Having primarily used iMacs and Mac Pros for several years now, I was unsure about buying a Mini.  However, I am very happy with my purchase.  Not only is it faster than I would have expected, but I have also noticed a considerable drop in my electric bill since switching to it (something I never even considered in the purchase).  I do not consider it a step down or a lesser Mac as some suggest it is.I primarily use the following software on my Mac Mini w/Snow Leopard and all work extremely well:  Adobe CS4 versions of InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator; Filemaker Pro 9; Office 2004; iWork 09; and VirtualBox.The one slow down in the system is likely the internal hard drive.  I found a significant speed increase by using an external USB drive to boot the Mini from.  That said, I still primarily boot from the internal drive.I have found the internal airport and bluetooth antennas to have excellent range.The Mini runs whisper quiet and even having it's dual core taxed 100% for extended periods I've only ever felt it to be slightly warm.One minor issue is the power cord, which doesn't have the snuggest fit.  This normally isn't a problem, however if you are unplugging a USB cable in the back that has intertwined with the power cord, it can easily pull it out too.  This happened to me once while the Mini was on, so now when I need to make a change in back I always hold the power plug in place while I work on the cables.

$REVIEW.: From everything I read, the purple unit is the same as the black base model, only $10 cheaper
It's also half the price of my Apple TV

In comparing it with the ATV, Roku's interface is funky (meaning not that well thought out)
Roku does offer more channels than ATV and for most of them you will be opening your wallet.I'm an Amazon Prime member, meaning I have access to Amazon's limited and not-easy-to-search-for free video titles


Their selection is pretty sucky, compared to Netflix
Do these comments belong in a Roku review? Well yes, if you're getting Roku to take advantage of Amazon's videos


Join Prime for the shipping, not the videos.

$review_text.: As I write this review these speakers are currently only $129. If I had the money, I'd buy them in a second purely because of the price. New speakers for under $200 with a wide frequency range, bi-amp gold plated binding posts and real wood on top of it all? There are many other budget speakers out there that are very superior to these... they'll cost you at least $170 more though.Polk is probably the only large mass-consumer audio brand that deserves some respect. They put out solid, good sounding products. Right now you can buy a cheap sherwood reciever, a PSW10 sub and these... which will be a respectable sounding stereo set-up for under $350.P.S: I probably am coming across as selling polk pretty hard, but I really am just a normal guy who appreciates getting solid sound for a reasonable amount of money.

$REVIEW.: I bought this lens recently to put on myNikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lensand see whether I wanted this lens or theTokina AT-X116PRDXN AT-X PRO DX 11-16mm Ultra-wide Angle Lens for Nikon.I'll start off by saying both lenses are great lenses and I did not have any image quality problems with either.I am no great photographer or reviewer of photography equipment, but I will give the things I liked and didn't like about each lens that led me to my decision of which to keep.Nikon - The main thing this lens has over the Tokina for me is that the autofocus will work on the d5100.  I wasn't sure how big of an issue this would be on a wide angle lens.  It turned out that it was handy to have, but focusing on something at 11mm is super easy to do and gives me something to do.  The Nikon does have a wider range of zoom 10-24 instead of 11-16, but I'm not losing out on much since I already have aNikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.Tokina - This lens is quite a bit heavier and seems to suggest it is made from more durable materials.  It also has a constant 2.8 aperture which, although I won't be using constantly, is nice to have.  The Tokina has a lot nicer focus ring and has not given me any problems.  Tokina is about 200 bucks cheaper as well.In the end I went with the Tokina because there was nothing about the Nikon that made me think it was worth more money.  I'm not saying it is overpriced, maybe just the Tokina is underpriced.  If they were the same price it would really be a toss up.  If you already have a camera that has in-body autofocus, I would definitely go with the Tokina.This is a great, fun lens - even though I ended up returning it.

$review_text.: OK I admit I don't know what a 5 star motherboard is like.  I've built a few AMD Phenom x6 and Intel I7 2600K systems with Gigabyte mother boards and have been very happy.  I wanted the Z68 chipset in this one.  The boards came out very similar in my research and to be honest I don't remember the exact reason I chose this one but I'm happy.The feature set of this board is great.  Lots of USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.  2 SATA controllers with 8 ports.  Built in Bluetooth is nice.I really like the headers they supply for the front panel lights and switches and USB (I'd like to buy more of those, they only give us one).My biggest complaint so far is the high speed PCIe 2_16 x4 slot is on the edge of the board so I couldn't install the NVidia GTX560 in that slot because it is a double wide card.  The headers for USB, HD audio, Front panel and 1394 are in the way.  I'm not sure if it makes a difference, I need more research on this.The other thing that may not have anything to do with the MB is that I could not use the stock Intel CPU heatsink/fan.  Running the I72600K at full bore it was reporting temps of 94-96C.  I put in a CoolerMaster Hyper 212+ and they went down to 67-72C.  The same CPU has run much cooler other systems I've built and this case seems to have better airflow.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a USB 3.0 HUB with Ethernet adapter for use at work when working on Windows 8 tablets, like the Surface Pro

 When I am making 'clone images' for deployment, I prefer to use an external USB mouse, need the use of a USB thumb drive, and have Ethernet connectivity
 This Satechi hub provides all those needs and so far has worked very well for me

 It's made out of plastic and feels a bit 'hollow', but otherwise it has a long enough cable for use on something like the Surface Pro and is well built


 It comes with a 'mini' CD with XP/Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 drivers on it


 They also have a link that goes to their website to download Windows, Mac, Linux drivers if needed, but if you download the Windows driver from the website, that zip file only contains the Windows 8.1 drivers
 (However, Windows 8.1 doesn't need an additional driver to have this be functional.)For those of you wanting more technical detail, there are several of these hubs from various vendors and they all look identical to each other except for the name stamped on them

 (I suspect they are identical.)  This Satechi hub uses the ASIX AX88179 NIC chipset, which is what most the other similar hubs from other manufacturers use

 For reference, the specific hardware id in Windows device manager is &#34;USB\VID_0B95&PID;_1790&#34; and it worked directly with Windows 8.1 without the need to add a driver
 Also, I use a WinPE 5.0 USB boot drive and it also supported this directly without me needing to rebuild the WinPE 5.0 boot drive to add an additional driver.

There's only one problem I have with this adapter: the connection is finicky. Sometimes if I twist the plug on my phones jack, I can hear the sound go rather quiet. So, either the jack on my phone is bad or the wiring in the adapter isn't the greatest. Regardless, it was only a little over a dollar and still works pretty well so I'm not really complaining.

$review_text.: This is a decent camera, especially at this price point.  Set up was very easy, although you *do* need to have a computer and a spare LAN port in your network router, along with Internet connectivity.  Even at that, it took me less than 30 minutes to have a functional camera that I could access from my iPhone or computer.I like that I can control the camera remotely, although the application is very clunky...I wish it would pan and tilt more smoothly.  Typically you wait a second or two after you hit the "pan" symbol on the app, so you push...wait....push...wait...and so on.  Since I'm using this more for a static view of things instead of trying to follow the action I may see, it's not *that* big of a deal, but it does get cumbersome after awhile.More vexing to me and keeping this from a five star review is the focus.  Out of the box the image is like looking through the bottom of a Coke bottle, while wearing glasses with a 20-year-old prescription.  It's like everything is covered in Vaseline.  You can manually focus the camera, but I kind of wish that I had the ability to focus the image through the iPhone app.  Instead I needed to have the app open on my phone while installing the camera, then focus and verify the clarity of the image on my phone screen.  It is a bit laggy in this respect as well.I did play with the apps a little, both the DLink Lite app (for the iPhone) and the paid DLink app for the iPad.  The iPad app gets you the ability to view more than one camera at a time on the screen (I also have a smaller DLink camera in another room).  I could see this combination being a very easy-to-set-up surveillance system for small businesses and homes.  The caveat there is the camera itself is made vulnerable via the exposed power cable. The camera includes motion and sound sensors that will send you an email if it detects something.  Very handy on the iPad app is you can choose what areas the camera will focus on vis a vis movement before sending you a notification.  Very nice feature, as you can keep the lower portion of the vision field inactive in case you have pets or something.Lastly, a word about the setup scheme here...for maximum convenience and compatibility with the DLink apps you are urged to use the (free) MyDlink service.  Apparently this means your video feed is going through DLink's servers on its way to your computer or mobile device.  Obviously this creates privacy concerns.  For that matter there is also exposure if you're using the wireless feature of the camera (as opposed to hooking it up via Ethernet).  Some folks may not be 100% comfortable with the privacy compromise you must make, at least by definition, in exchange for the very easy setup of this camera.  That said, the setup does allow you to skip the MyDLink thing, but then you sacrifice some of the feature set.All in all I'm satisfied with the camera.  For what it is, picture quality is good, it has acceptable IR capabilities, and it's versatile enough to allow for a wide variety of uses.
$SUMMARY.: Easy set up, good camera

$REVIEW.: I recently started using a flash for my photography, and I've been buying accessories every few weeks to build up my kit. I was looking at a softbox on a stand, but I was afraid my flash wouldn't line up when mounted with its wireless trigger attached. I saw this 8x12 on-flash soft box, and decided for the price I could give it a shot. 8x12 is pretty big, but luckily I can mount this on my flash on-camera, and it doesn't show even with my kit canon lens wide open at 18mm. It really helps to soften the light when using it like this, if for some reason the ceiling has a lot of angles or is really high up, this can save you from some pretty ugly shots. I really purchased this to use on my tripod when I use the flash remotely, and it works great for that too. Helps soften up fill light, and helps in the studio for softening shadows for portraits.If you want to leave this on camera and plan on running around a lot, this may be too big for you. I'm fine with it because the bigger surface area gives better results, but sometimes it's not really practical. They do sell one a bit smaller that might be better for those situations. Overall, its a great product and I would suggest it to anyone using an external flash unit.

$REVIEW.: If you are someone for whom the technical details of a webcam or the level of image definition is not a problem, the Live!Cam Connect HD may be a good solution


The camera is plug and play -- I unboxed it, plugged it into my macbook pro, and was recording two minutes later
The picture quality and sound are both better than my Macbook's built in solutions, but nowhere near the quality of the Logitech D920 1080p webcam that is my "go to" camera
This webcam works great for Skype, Google+ Hangouts, and with the Macbook's Photo Booth application


Value adds for the product include Windows software, movie editing functionality and the ability to set a parental password to restrict usage of the webcam
Reasonably priced and easy to use, I believe the Creative Live! Cam Connect HD 780p is a functional webcam solution for most webcam needs


If you are a professional, look closely at the Logitech I mentioned above prior to purchasing this webcam.

$review_text.: I read the reviews on this Anker 40W, 5-port charger and it seemed to be a good deal. Unfortunately, it was out of stock on Amazon so I called the company. They said they were out of stock but would have them available again in a couple weeks. Because of the reviews, I decided to wait....and I'm glad I did.I bought them through Amazon when they became available and decided to give them a test to see how they worked before I took them on our next trip. To that end, I plugged in an iPad 50% charged, a RAZR M 70% charged, and an Incredible 2 60% charged. Within a little over an hour all devices were completely charged. Therefore, there is no doubt in my mind that the 8 amps in this Anker 40 Watt charger is the real deal for charging multiple devices.Two sidebars. First, the Amazon price of $25.99 was by far the lowest of any other seller. Second, the customer service from Anker is excellent. From the time I inquired about when this would be available they kept me up to date with emails. They even contacted me after purchase to make sure I was satisfied with their product.Overall, I am very happy with device and am sure it will be very beneficial on trips when you need to charge multiple devices and can do so from one charger.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this unit after trying to decide between it and the Appradio 3.  I went ahead with this one because the app radio lacked HD radio and seemed fraught with problems when using the iPhone 5.  I installed this in a 2010 Toyota Prius with an ASWC-1 steering control interface using Metra harnesses for the radio and interface and parking brake bypass (mostly because it was easier than running the parking brake detection switch).  The harness took about 30 minutes to solder together (I am neurotic about having a clean harness) and the dash install took another 20 minutes.  I made the iPhone 5 hookup with an Amazon basics lightning cable without the VGA harness.  I am able to use Pandora, on screen iPod control, bluetooth audio (not as nice as wired iPod control) and bluetooth calling.  I don't really mind not having the &#34;apps&#34;  onscreen because my phone is mounted to the console next to the head unit.  I use Google Maps for navigation and it is not supported anyway.  Motion X is from what I have read.

$REVIEW.: When it has came down to laptop computers, more of them do need a set of speakers specifically designed for their use, especially if you are burning to a CD or DVD for backup, or downloading your favorite movies and music


Phillips have made a good stride with making good products for the computer, These Phillips Notebook USB Speakers really work very well, and deliver a distinctive sound that works great with anything

The sound really is refreshing, but it is very useful

Considering that all laptops carry a mono-delivered sound, it is essential for one to be owned that delivers a better sound
I really like how simple these speakers handle


They are definitely worth their money
I really recommend these speakers from Phillips a whole lot


They definitely bring out the sound for your laptop.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+

$review_text.: I'm a huge fan of wrist straps. This one could be great if it didn't have one, big, annoying feature: the humongous bottom attachment.Okay, it's annoying to undo and redo the straps so they fit (see the graphic), but that brick of plastic on the bottom of the camera just blows.To use the strap you have to undo everything, then relead everything back through the padded grip. Not a big hairy deal. And the result is pretty good, very good actually. But I could do without the bottom plate. It does nothing to add to the grip's usefulness. And it's awkward and bulky and, as much as I like the grip proper, it just ticks me off.Buy it. Install it. Love it or hate it. I hate it.

$REVIEW.: The soldering workmanship looks good and the price was very reasonable. The outer shell is made of a lighter weight metal than with the top grade Amphenol connectors. I have had other e-bay cables arrive with outer shells of thinner gauge metal than this product. Those other cable ends at were easily deformed with little pressure. These cable ends will hold up to reasonable use. I am only running 100 watts so I cannot speak to the voltage and current carrying characteristics. I have ordered other cables from this vendor with good results.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this item primarily because the 504 lacks its own stand.  It's really nice to view it without having to lay it flat or hold it in your hands.  But there are two problems with the "stand" function.  It is at a near vertical angle, which is not optimal for viewing, and it can tip forward when you are trying to set it up.  The second problem is that the snap that holds the cover in place to function as a stand, pops out really easily.  It takes some effort to get it to stand properly.  The other really annoying problem is that it is a little too small for the device.  It's made of really tough leather (not the soft kind), so it offers great protection, but it also doesn't "give" much.  It's like buying a leather shoe that is a little too small.  You either have to wear it for a long time, or you have to use a shoe stretcher.  I imagine these things are not hand made, so if mine is too small, yours probably will be too.  You would think they would have made it the correct size!  Anyway, because there is no other option, I would probably still have bought it because I love carrying my memories around with me in the 504.  I wouldn't say stay away from it, but beware!

$review_text.: I am another K3 owner that purchased the K4 based mainly on the weight and reduced size. I have always enjoyed reading my K3 naked, enjoying the feel and weight without a cover, only storing it covered. With the K4 I noted an almost flimsy feel and was constantly catching the backs of the page turning buttons with my fingers, sometimes substantially. Because I am Very careful with my stuff, I became concerned the buttons would be damaged. I don't know if mine is defective, having a poor fit or not, but considered options to address it.Checking out the SportGrip Skin Case, by covering the back, catching the buttons would be eliminated. It works perfectly! It is tight fitting, but stretches for removal, I no longer fear scratches when setting it down on hard surfaces or even damp ones and it's now impossible to catch the backs of the page turners! All control buttons are well marked and allow full function, probably extending their wear and tear. I have improved grip, so less tension is needed for long-term reading (increased weight addressed later).  Overall, it seems to offer a sturdier feel and obvious additional protection.However, because of the extra thickness of the silicon, the Kindle is no longer the lightweight reader I was looking for. Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems almost as heavy as the K3 and I find myself setting it onto my lap or something to give my fingers a break. Setting it down is safer now, so if the SportGrip were half the thickness, or less, maybe the middle ground of weight VS protection could be found. I doubt perfect protection if dropped from a substantial height can be afforded unless placed in a "case", which is how I store mine. A thick version as one model, a really thin version as another option might work out better. The decals don't sound like they could offer that back or dust protection the SportGrip provides.All in all, I don't regret purchasing this cover and will keep options open for the future!

 Hear everything...when they're in
 The physical design is not very good


 Simply lying in the bath tub, water seeps in and sound is lost as ears are filled with water


 Then they're totally dislodged.I don't know what the excess plastic &#34;handles&#34; are for, but they and those bulbous outer parts are a hindrance to a secure fit
 The buds do not seal the water out as they basically sit at my ears versus fitting IN my ears
 They can't with those big outer parts.Had a five dollar pair of iHip waterproofs that lasted like two years and never had this problem


 The iHips actually fit IN THE EAR not at the edge of my ears, so water never got in.

$review_text.: Every time I needed to access plugs or wires behind my TV stand, the jungle of wires was disheartening. I had plug strips plugged into other plug strips, and it was all but impossible to find the cord for whatever I was looking to unplug.I bought this slim 24-plug strip and spent a sweaty afternoon behind the TV, unplugging everything, labelling the wires, and neatly plugging them all into this single strip. What a difference! For starters, all those plug strips were bulky, and this takes up very little room behind the TV stand. The length of it makes it easy to plug in items on either end of the long stand. The on-off switch is covered, so that it can't be accidentally turned off--which is great, because I have managed to hit the switch on some of my old plug strips while vacuuming, and that wreaks havoc with recording schedules and such.It may seem silly, but the whole house feels cleaner and more organized to me now that the tangle of dusty wires behind the TV is cleaned up!

$REVIEW.: I have to say this before anything else - this is a $100 camera


 You get what you pay for.The good:It's 10M PixelsIt's $100.Takes nice pictures (in good light).AA batteries.Fits in my hand very well.The "Auto" mode makes it easy.The bad:Cheap construction (to the point of damaging Canon's reputation of quality products in my opinion).No image stabilization (but...

 it is a $100 camera...)**"Charging the flash"..
 This is an approx 5-10 second delay every time you want to take a picture
 It may not sound like that much time, but it gets real annoying real quick.Bottom line:It takes pictures


 It takes nice pictures


 They get a little grainy and colors get a little off at low light

 But in good light, it makes good picts
 But the delay between pictures, mostly from the "Charging the flash" message, is just too much of an annoyance for me


 Which is a shame, because this is a decent little camera otherwise


 But, it's annoying enough that I wouldn't recommend purchasing this camera (unless your patiences exceeds mine).

In addition the dell monitor adjust to more angles and heights.While this monitor may not be as sleek at the Apple monitor, it is more affordable and offers more features with better tech specs

It has a base clock of 3.2 ghz but it will boost up to 3.6 ghz if it needs to
 Additionally, the price per performance ratio is actually better than the 4670, making it a better value overall (especially when the 4670 is only marginally faster on all benchmark tests than this thing)

 If you don't overclock due to the reliability concerns, this is the processor to get.

$REVIEW.: The Nike+ Sportwatch GPS is a watch for runners. Of course it gives you the time and date, but also tracks your running (using the GPS function), running time, distance, pace, heart rate, and calories burned. After a run, you can plug the watch into your computer and upload the data to the Nike+ website where you can analyse the data. The site is free and has some really nice features. Amoung other things, you can see graphs of the data and the route you traveled (with elevation and your pace).To sense your pace, the watch uses the GPS when you're outside and uses a small sensor when indoors on a treadmill. The sensor is made to fit inside certain Nike running shoes. However, there are pouches and clips available on Amazon that will hold the sensor on any shoe. These usually velcro or clip into the shoe laces. To get the most accurate readings, you should have the sensor as far forward as you can. Using the sensor outside enables the watch to calibrate it against the GPS for better readings. You must use the sensor inside as the watch can only get the GPS signals when you're outside (normal for all GPS units).One disapointing item (and the reason I gave the watch only 4 stars) is that to get your heart rate you need to purchase the Polar Wearlink+ (Nike version).  This costs another 60 to 70 dollars. This is a well made unit where the transmitter snaps onto the belt, allowing you to wash or replace the belt. Also, the battery is user replaceable.The watch is not small, but it's still comfortable to wear. The lcd has large numbers making the readout easy to read.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and recommend it.

$review_text.: Video production is my profession. My idroduction to photography was in middle school back in the 80s when I learned on a Pentax K1000 (Of Course). I have always owned an SLR and now days DSLR becuase I love the TTL opical Viewfinder and manual controls. I also pretty loyally followed the Minolta line and then Alpha when Sony bought them out. I still own Minolta XD-7 and 800Si film cameras. I say all of that to build the foundation for my initial skepticism about the lcd viewfinder in this camera.Being in video production, I am obviously very used to LCD viewfinders but for a still camera, I was always a firm believer in a good bright optical viewfinder. After owning this camera for a while now, I am starting to change my mind. In this age of digital cameras, a digital LCD viewfinder is making alot of sense. Digital sensors still do not react like film. They clip realy fast and hard on highlights while film will roll off a bit smoother and is more forgiving. The digital viewfinder can give you a great WYSIWYG view of not only depth of field but dynamic range. Of course, if you are shooting RAW you can get away with a bit more but highlight clipping is clipping and for the general shooter using Jpegs out of the camera seeing what the final output will look like is a great aid.Anyway, I bought the camera for its video capabilities which I am still suprised aren't as well known as I would think. It is an amazing little thing. The clarity resolution and image quality that this thing puts out has you wondering if it really is just 8bit 4:2:0 AVCHD. There are hacks available to push the bitrate and really bring great video out of the thing but even right out of the box it is astonishing. Autofocus with the kit lens is very fast and silent. The Kit lens itself is almost too sharp. It's soo light, I can run it on a handheld steadicam without though of fatigue for most situations. The fully articulating LCD screen is a pleasure as well.Since there is no mirror, you can mount just about any SLR lens ever made on this thing with an adapter. You will not be able to autofocus and because of the sensor size being about half of 35mm film, you will be cropped (Or zoomed in) by a factor of 2. That means that the really nice Minolta Rokkor 50mm F1.4 is now a really nice 100mm F1.4. Finding fast wide angle lenses gets a bit more challenging and coslty. There is an adapter coming out that will reportedly cut the crop factor down to 1.5 and increase the light by a full stop but at a price of course. Still, it's really cool to have all those options out there in cheap used lenses.As a stills camera, it's pretty good. Not amazing like in video but still pretty good. The native aspect ratio is 4:3 which just looks too square to me so I often set it to 3:2 to match what my eyes are used to when composing a shot. The sensor in the GH2 is a little oversized purposefully to accompdate multiple aspect ratios better so you don't take as huge of a hit in resolution. RAW is 14bit I believe and what you will want to shoot in if you are serious about the pictures. The JPEG engine is not all that great...The controls are pretty well laid out. Aperature and Shutter are conrolled by a single dial when in full manual mode. I am used to seperate dials but the single dial works well as you click it in to switch betweed the two. There is a 1:1 focus assist that will kick in either when you move the focus ring or on demand via a assignable button. There is no autofocus motor in the camera so it is completely on the lens to get it fast. The kit lens is VERY fast focusing. I really like that shutter release mode, focsing mode and focus metering are all on levers. even though it has a touchscreen, Panasonic didn't drop any manual controls from the GH1 so you really don't have to go into a menu for anything once you have the camera set the way you like.I really enjoy this camera and the video I've gotten out of it impresses the heck out of people.

$review_text.: It's hard to believe how good these are for the money. I've got six; four of them are in a surround system and two are in another room for music.One thing to note is that even though these are &#34;bookshelf&#34; speakers they won't produce much bass if they're literally placed on a shelf. That's because the bass port is located on the back of the speaker and you need some open space behind them if you want them to produce much bass.So for best results you can either 1) use them on speaker stands and/or 2) pair them with a subwoofer that will handle the bass duties.

$REVIEW.: I bought these to replace a pair of E2C's that lasted 3 years of heavy use (half marathons).  I also bought the Monster Turbine for essentially the same price ($100).  The Monster's sound better but are very heavy and tend to slide out of the ear canal when running.  The SE210's fall between the E2C and Monster's in sound quality; they are very comfortable and secure when running.I was hoping the short cord (without extension) would work with an ipod on an ARM band, but it it too short for this.  I'm 5'9, medium build, and it extends only to my chest (not my arm).  2" to 4" longer would have been perfect, as it is you will need an extension for anything other than a shuffle attached to your collar.

$review_text.: First of all, I am not what you would call audiophile.  I am generally not picky about sound quality, as long as they are not obviously terrible.That said, I wanted a new ear plug because when I got my Archos AV500, I found the one that came with it uncomfortable.  I was looking around $20 range, but they were mostly with mixed reviews.  After several weeks of search, I bumped into this.  It came with incredible reviews everywhere.  Although it costed more than I was going to spend ($40), I was assured by many online that it's worth it, especially since many places sell it for $70.I just received it yesterday and had chance to try it out.  All I can say is, Wow!  I didn't realize the ear plug can make such difference.  Songs, especially those that are encoded with high bps, came to life like I didn't expect.  It sounded full and rich.  I didn't know it's supposed to sound like that.  Just for the giggle, I put the old plug back in and listened the same song.  Now that I experienced cx300, it sounded like an old Nintendo 8 bit music.I was also amazed with the volume it outputs.  I had to turn down AV500 quite a bit compared to when I was using the other ear plug.

$review_text.: TheMicra Digital CAT5e Snagless Patch Cableis an adequate Ethernet cable option


 These cables are commoditized at this point, so barring defects most people look to value when selecting one
 My primary thought is that choosing longer cable lengths may offer more bang for your buck
 So even if you think you only need the shortest one, it's probably best for you to get the longer 10 or 15 foot cable and wind up the excess.PROS:++ Ethernet cable worked as advertised with no excessive errors or dropped packets++ Works from standard 10-base-T speeds all the way up to Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps)++ Standard clear RJ45 connectors++ Snagless design with sliding boots to protect connectors++ Sliding boots make it easier to snap in connectors in with low clearance++ Thick tabs to minimize the chance of breakage++ Thick PVC cable construction for sufficient durability++ Cable also seems to be kink-free compared to most budget cables++ Frustration free packaging standard++ Standard 5-year warrantyCONS:-- Longer lengths provide a better value-- Generic black cable is hard to pick out near many other cables-- No class info printed on cable jacket (a standard feature on better cables)-- Cable has some memory when unwound-- Some may prefer hard-molded boots or double tabbed connectorsCONCLUSIONThe cable and connectors are of acceptable construction
 For basic connectivity, this product works as advertised

 Just review all the available lengths to make sure you are getting the best value possible.Enjoy.

$review_text.: This is a very good glass filter. The multicoated anti glare finish is excellent in making this almost invisible when light is reflecting directly at it which is something you would want when putting this in front of a lens. The built quality is excellent the price is affordable and it can easily compare to the Hoya Pro-1 UV(0) filters which are pretty much the same as far as quality. One downside to this filter is cleaning it, can be a more laborious task since the finish on this glass can sometimes have scuff marks on it, of course there are the B+W filters which have another coating that mitigates that but a 3x the price. I always put on one of these Sigma UV filters or the Hoya Pro-1 UV(0) filters on all my lenses. It just gives you that stress free shooting experience since you can get close to your subject with out fearing it will cause damage to the lens itself. I do rarely take them off from time to time depending on the environment I am shooting in. I would say stay away from the non-multicoaded stuff it just causes to much light reflection, specially at night.Great Multicoated Glass, Virtually invisible to the camera and lens. Crucial accessory for protecting those expensive lenses.

$REVIEW.: I used this mainly as a source to watch portable videos, music, and as an alarm clock and calender and such
 The amount of applications that you can put on is vast and a lot of them are free which are cool
 I would think 8gb was enough for me because I had about 3 full movies and about 20 mp3 albums on mine and it still didn't touch the storage space
 If your looking for a PDA, music, video, calender and such, look no further


 I would suggest getting the 2nd generation iTouch they have now because it has an external speaker as well as headphones
The first gen you can only use headphones to listen to sound
 The 2nd generation is also smaller and a little better software updated I believe


 I am just reviewing this one because this is the one I bought when I had it

 The touch screen is amazing and this is the device that made me fall in love with Apple


 Their macbooks are nice, but the performance is not up to par on how much they cost


 I would definately buy Apple Accessories like this again though, I was thinking about getting the 2nd gen because I sold my first gen

 Maybe when they come down in price a little


 Anyways, if you want a great mp3 player, look no further this is the best product you will find, it's simply amazing.

Easy to charge


Just plug in the USB cable once a month or so for a few hours


Also love the backlighting

Hard to find that in a wireless keyboard.The only reasons I do not give it 5 stars is:A) I would prefer a full-size (with numeric keypad) keyboard

On a Mac, the delete key on the main keyboard is actually backspace

The delete key above the numeric keys is a real delete.andB) The illumination turns itself off too fast and you can't control that

$review_text.: I really wanted to try an iPad keyboard for my iPad 1, so I was ecstatic when I got this keyboard from Amazon.Unwrapping and set up took me less than 2 minutes, which was great. The keyboard is delivered with batteries (I think 2 AAA), and when you press the connect button and enable the BT on the iPad side, the password is shown on the screen and you can already use the keyboard to enter the password.The keyboard feels pretty nice on the hands, spacy and comfortable, it looks like a black apple keyboard. It has some function keys like home screen (equivalent to the home button), search button, play-fwd-backward etc. It's definitely easier to type on it than on the onscreen keyboard.Keyboard box/stand - it's very thin and easy to open and use. It supports 2 placement options for the iPad, portrait and landscape.What I didn't like about this product:1) I still had to use the touch screen in many (most) cases2) When the keyboard is connected, It disables the on screen keyboard. So you actually have to disconnect the keyboard to be able to use the on screen one.3) No height change capability (like most standard keyboards)4) (I should mention I'm a PC power user) there were several places/activities where I expected the keyboard to be functional and it failed me. One simple example is when you google something on safari (in the search box), you see the google suggestions options, but the down arrow does not work to traverse and choose the option. The supplied documentation does mention that this is something the app developer should support - so I guess it's apple's fault.5) Documentation - there is a URL for support documentation on the package - first, it does not lead to the right place, second - it does not add much to the details on the package.6) Switch language - couldn't find a way to do it7) Box/stand feels cheap and plasticyComparing to apple's keyboard:1) Warranty - you get 3 years vs 1 year from apple2) Price - same3) Size - apple's keyboard is delivered without a box, just a small dock, so a bit smaller & lighter.4) Batteries - sameAll in all, great addition to enable faster/easier writing on the iPad.a note to Logitech:* Adding a mouse/touch pad to the keyboard would be great* See my comment about documentation

 Speed isn't any faster than better USB 2.0 drives


The big con is the poor construction quality


Just read other reviews and the issue of the component pulling out of the rubber casing is true

Once you feel a slight wiggle, check your drive immediately

You will notice that the rubber surrounding the connector end of the drive can be pried open
Once it becomes to separate like that, use a good epoxy filler and squeeze a good amount into the drive to seal back the rubber
Otherwise it will pull out completely eventually.

$review_text.: Since this is my first GPS, I really have no way to compare whether this GPS is "better" than others. I can only describe my experiences with it.I first used the GPS locally (southeastern PA) to test it out since I had an upcoming trip to VT where I planned to really use it. I wanted to make sure I'd know how to use the controls. I used the GPS while taking public transit to see what it would say the best route was. I also used it while walking near my home and Philly to see if it knew small local streets. The GPS performed well (detouring whenever I went in unexpected directions) during these tests. There are settings to change your mode of transport to bike, bus, car/truck, foot, etc. and I used many of these modes. I never encountered any streets that weren't known and this surprised me since these maps are from 2006 and there is tons of construction. Speaking of which, that was one of my complaints: that 2006 maps are included with a late 2007 sold product. I think it should have the maps of the year it is sold in.Then came my trip to VT which I pre-mapped using Google on the way up thinking I'd see if the GPS agreed with the route I took. I had dragged my Google Map directions so that I could avoid the interstate routes that went through NJ. My route was PA->NY->VT on the way up. The Google map directions got me confused around the NY/VT border with some road names I couldn't find, but the GPS led me the rest of the way to Stowe, VT. I had absolutely no problems; I did not get lost once using the route the Nuvi 370 told me to take, even when I accidentally missed a turn and the route changed. Incidentally, it takes about 10-30 seconds to recalculate routes and I was pleased with that. In fact, the only slow point is when I first turned on the Nuvi and it took as long as 3 minutes to "acquire satellites."I then used the Nuvi around Stowe and found pretty much everything I punched in, including some not-so-run-of-mill places I wanted to visit. Some of the roads were dirt roads, but they were considered finished (just sort of backwoods, which seemed typical near some of the hiking spots I went to). The Nuvi did fail in finding Mt. Elsmore State Park since it took me to someone's house in the woods. It was definitely not a ranger station or park office. That was it's only failure.Coming home I allowed the GPS to completely figure my route. I had previously set the GPS for "shortest distance," but once I changed it to "fastest route" it put me back on interstates, which is where I wanted to be after all of those one-lane (in each direction) VT roads. Another small problem I had was the Nuvi's insistence on calling road name changes "turns", which sometimes caused me to wonder whether I missed something. I realized that all I really did was change roads so from then on I ignored the word "turn" if I saw I was not supposed to physically turn. Also, I never used the sound so I was going strictly by looking at the GPS. I prefer listening to music so I figured I might not hear the turns anyway. I used the mileage to each turn to remember to change directions or roads.If you click the bottom left of the screen (Expected Arrival Time when you're routing), you can get a view of the trip information like fastest and average speeds as well as mileage and total time. Clicking the top where the current routing info is (like the road you are on and the very next upcoming turn) lets you see quite a few more steps in the future, which I also found useful.All in all, I believe this GPS (which I bought here on Amazon) was well worth the money even though the maps are old-ish, the travel kit and languages come separately, the warm-up time is a little long, and I could not get it to stick to the dash (I placed it in the driver's cup holder instead since the dash of my car is too slanted to reach). I will be using my Nuvi 370 often.

They transfer your data fast if hooked to USB 3.0, but equally as well being backward compatible with USB 2.0.  I am using one of each at present.  They are typically easy to undock, like others, but I like that the frame holds them snugly on the sides and the rear is open.

On this one I have to pry the kindle away from the backing a bit to get to the back power button and I have to push it up hard to move the bottom leather holder away from the recharge micro USB port (I will fix this with a pair of scissors shortly).I would not let those minor hassles discourage anyone from using this case.  The simplicity, the stand, and the price are outstanding.  The keyboard is easily removable to make it easier to hold and read and the protection is nice from incidental damage although this is not, nor does it claim to be, a tough case or Otter box.

It took a little figuring out of how they did the VLANs (switch GUIs vary widely among models even with a mfg line) but this packs a lot of configuration options for a low price.  So far so good.  It even came with the most recent firmware, which is kind of unusual.  It's kind of cool you can power the switch off a PoE source, though I'm not using that.

$review_text.: Got the camcorder yesterday and let it charged fully before using.I took some videos and pictures around the house and found the recordings to be a bit "out-of-focus". They were just not shape and clear like they should be. The camera seems not to be very good in taking pictures. In fact, I took similar pictures using my HTC desire and they come out far better. I tried on same object and same or similar distances and lighting conditions.I tried various setting thinking it must have been an issue of setup, but nothing I tried would make the captured qualify of pictures or videos better.I can't tell if the camcorder was defective before it was shipped; shaken loose during shipping or it was just me. I think it is unlikely to be an issue with me since I have had 6 digital camera/camcorders before and none had this "out-of-focus" issue.Very disappointed, and would probably not buy another GE brand camera/camcorder again.

$REVIEW.: I got this mainly because I do a lot of paranormal investigations and having a strong voice recorder is a good thing.  I don't know if this is the optimal recorder for ghost hunting and trying to capture EVP.  There's not substantial noise reduction, but the three internal microphones do tend to pick up EVERYTHING.For those normal people (LOL) who aren't paranormal investigators, this is a handy piece of equipment for taking notes, recording dictation, using in a classroom environment, etc.  It's easy to put in a briefcase, bag, or purse to take along with you.  The device isn't as small as I had thought, so it's not exactly something stealthy.  If you put the recorder out, people will see it.  The features are easily understandable and usable.  All-in-all, a good find and worth using.

I use it cooking, straightening my hair, on the treadmill, while eating and when laying down so the angles are important to me


 You will find one perfect for you.Also I NEED a magnetic cover that shuts the Kindle off because my kids never remember

$review_text.: This may not be a surprise to many but I suspect more than one will find this thread and find it useful. Particularly Nikon users as they are used to being served well in time-lapse functionality. But for now this is the best super-zoom by far in my opinion.I am happy to report that the following unit works just fine with the recently released DMC-FZ150 as a wireless shutter and intervalometer solution. Also if you remove the small rubber grommet from the top of the remote you can plug the cable into it, and your camera on the other, for a wired intervalometer (timer) remote configuration.The wireless has been reported to have excellent range, and went through a few apartments worth of wall this evening just fine.The vendor got it to me in 6 days.You will not be able to extend the shutter past its already stated 15 seconds. But full manual, A, P, S, Auto, Bracketing all work fine. Changing camera settings between exposures, does not effect the timer settings.You can program a delay before starting , hours, minutes, seconds etc. 1-99 exposures or set it to limitless exposures. Also a 1 second continuous exposure always available with this model as long as you have not programmed something longer in camera. There is a bulb setting I didn't mess with. But the meat and potatoes of the gizmo works just fine. The manual is pretty badly translated but gets the job done.I'm glad I popped for the $75.00 for the wireless version instead of the $50.00 version as it is more pleasurable to use. And has a reported 80 meter range, one fella tested at 100 yards.

$REVIEW.: This is my 1st 5.1 System.  I'm coming from a Samsung Sound-bar.  The Receiver, HTR-3065, is the same as the RX-V373.  Different Model # because one is HTiB and other is a standalone.  Setup was fairly easy but time consuming.  I mounted my rear surrounds to the wall with speaker mounts.  YPAO Setup was a breeze but I would use a tripod for better results instead of pillows,(my 1st mistake).  After setup I had to turn the trim level on the center up a few dBs to match the mains.  After a month, I wasn't digging the front soundstage so I bought NS-C210 Center and NS-B210 Mains, (Yamaha), and been very happy with them since.  Leaps and bounds better than the NS-AP2600 Satellites that come with this HTiB, my reasoning for 3 Stars instead of 4.  Don't get me wrong, these speakers do sound nice for what they are but don't fill the room very well.  I use two of the NS-AP2600 Satellites for surrounds though.  I'm a purists and even though a lot the DSP Sound Modes sound cool, I use Straight for everything.  Sometimes I'll use Action Game for well, PS3 Games but Blu-Rays and TV is Straight.  DO NOT LEAVE Compressed Music Enhancer on for anything but Music.  Shouldn't need it all for CDs.  I mistakenly left it on after listening to some MP3 songs and noticed my sound from Blu-Rays and TV sounded brash and overproduced causing adverse effects in mainly dialogue.  Male voices would sound too "Swooshy" and underwhelming.  Some of the explosions and overall sound effects were at the point of distorting even though I knew everything was set up correctly.  After turning Compressed Music Enhancer off it sounded normal,(my 2nd mistake).  THX recommends setting crossover at 80Hz.  It does sound a heck of a lot better at 80Hz than at 110 or 120Hz which is the recommended crossover for the NS-AP2600 Satellite Speakers but before I upgraded, YPAO set them at 80Hz.  The Sub does it's job IMO.  I'm sure I could a much better Sub than the one that comes with this system but it's still pretty good.  No complaints.  I did have to turn the volume on the sub about 3/4 instead of the recommended 1/2.  This receiver also lets you use Dynamic Range Compression on anything, not just Dolby Sources.  It's cool if you live in an apt. or watch late at night and don't want to wake up roommates or wife/husband but leave it alone.  It sounds much better with it off.  Overall this system is a steal, minus the speakers.

The default connectors come with a factory wiring setting of 12v.  It was a bit too loud for my taste considering that I had two sitting next to each other.  I changed the wiring to 5v and they're quiet.PerformanceI have two sitting a couple of inches away from my computer's main hard drive, a WD Black.  This hard drive used to get really hot. After installing these two fans, that hard drive is as cool as it is when is not running.  Incredible.There are plenty of instructions online on how to rework the wiring to your liking.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to get the leather smart case because ai thought it would hold up better, and after feeling the polyethylene ones, I'm glad I went with the leather
As far as smart cases go, however, they don't provide as much of an "iPad stand" as I would have liked, and therefore could have gone with a cheaper case that was more functional


However, I'll be honest, I did buy this for the cool factor


It's pretty sweet
Plus I like the navy color

Anyway, bottom line it's a good screen covor but not a good stand at all


For actual protection, I recommend the Zagg screen/body cover or a totally enclosed case for the iPad.

$REVIEW.: If you are in the market for a wireless adapter for your laptop, BE AWARE that this one is easily bumped while moving the laptop around, sitting in an easy chair, amongst books on a table or desk, etc.  It will lose internet connection and then you'll have to re-load your pages again.I needed a wireless because after a middle of the night automatic Windows update (Windows 7), my computer was completely frozen, and after 'restoring to prior to the update, I no longer had the internal wifi.  I spent HOURS AND HOURS trying all kinds of technical things and never got the wifi to work again.  It became much easier to purchase an external USB adapter.  By the time I gave up on fixing the internal wifi I had been without wifi for several days and was eager to just get back to work.  So I did not read too many reviews.  I went to radio shack, walking distance from my apt, and asked which one was a good seller with few returns and they pointed to this one.Installation was quick and easy and I get fast enough connections but no one mentioned that because it sticks out a few inches it is subject to easily getting bumped if you move your notebook from room to room, or have it on your lap.  Then you lose your connection and have to unplug and replug, and then wait for the connection to go through.  Mostly this is not a terrible hassle, but sometimes, if you want to print something out and it gets bumped, then it becomes annoying.I've had it for about 6 months now and other than the bumping, it seems to work just fine.  If I buy another one it will be more compact in design.
$SUMMARY.: gets bumped on the laptop too easily

$REVIEW.: Flip & its official products will no longer be made so get this while you can.For under $15 its great for any light Pocket Camera.Useful to set up almost any place.I like the double velcro straps which are 12 inchs each.Could have used more rubber surfaces to reduce sliding when strapped to flat or odd surfaces.The adjustable neck would have been better to have a ball on both ends instead of just 1 ball, then it would have been truely an any direction adjustment.The tripod legs are wrapped closed by straps so it can be a hassle to use @ times.

$review_text.: I bought a Home Theatre in a Box from one of the big box stores about 2 years ago. It is a quality Denon receiver with Boston Acustics speakers and Subwoofer. The only problem is that the subwoofer cable is a very thin RCA cable that picks up noise. I looked up Subwoofer cables and came accross this cable. Double shielded and 15 feet long. I was sold. When the cable arrived, i compared the two together and the new cable is about 3 times the size. Now my bass is cleaner and I dont have to turn it up as loud to get the same results. Plus the faint noise that you could here in the sub is now gone. A must have cable for clean sounding bass.
$SUMMARY.: A nice upgrade

$review_text.: This is the third wireless adapter I've ever used and it's probably the worst one, but it's not horrible.  The connection speed varies greatly, it will go from 1-2 bars to 4-5 bars and vice-versa multiple times within a few minutes sometimes..  It loses connection a lot, but only for a few seconds, or about a minute max. I'm thinking it has something to do with how hot it gets (it gets very hot for what it is.)  I don't see it lasting very long, definitely not something you would want for gaming because of all the signal drops.  This thing can/will drop signal 10+ times in an hour with no known interference.  I have an older router, but did not get nearly this many signal drops with my other adapters using the same router, and got faster speeds most of the time.Pros:  Cheap, very easy setup (plug and play), small and looks nice.Cons: Unreliable speeds, unstable connection, runs hot.

$review_text.: Unlike the Sony TDG-BR250/B glasses which I also own, these glasses are much more comfortable for me, as I already have to wear corrective glasses.  The weight on my nose is minimal, and the pressure above the ears where they sit is also barely noticeable.  Although I agree with others that the TDG-BR250/B does a better job at removing ambient light from being seen from the sides, these are just so much more comfortable to wear over the long time, and I am used to distorted peripheral vision under normal circumstances, the added light is not an issue for me.

$review_text.: I've had this keyboard for a few weeks.  It's my third split ergonomic keyboard, my first from Microsoft.  The hand position feels just right, but depressing the keys is noisy and unpleasant.  The space bar is worst of all, since hitting it anywhere but right in the middle requires an extra hard press.  And since this is a split keyboard, my thumbs don't reach to the middle of the space bar when in the standard typing position.  I had hoped the space key would loosen up to allow my off-center use without requiring so much force to depress it.  It hasn't, and I still find myself correcting missed space typos weeks later.  I use this keyboard with a laptop when at my desk, and I keep catching myself typing at desk height on the laptop to avoid the Microsoft keyboard, a no-no for me due to a repetitive stress injury.  While I read about the space bar issue before purchasing, and decided it wouldn't bother me enough to make me choose something else, buying this keybord was a mistake for me.

$REVIEW.: The only thing I don't like about this mouse is that it looks like it has a bunch of "dents" beneath the plastic layer on top.  It does look good in the dark, and this is not a big issue at all.  In fact, I give it 5 stars for its tactile buttons, easy smooth scrolling, and the extra buttons, which are all programmable.The size of the mouse is perfect:  I don't drag my pinky finger, which had become calloused but is not any longer.It took me some time to get used to, but not very much.  Maybe a few weeks.  I'll post here again if/when it breaks.  I expect the first thing to break to be the scroll wheel, as it's the only moving part.  I go through a lot of mice, as this is a common issue.  This mouse might last longer than a year, but I don't know yet.As for $$$ price compared to what you get, it's great.  I wouldn't complain, because it's a high performance device.

$REVIEW.: I was unsure if it would work up to the day of installation


I used this cable, another DVI-D cable of 25 feet, a machine with HDMI, and a 2560x1600 monitor

Tested it all at home on my 1080p TV and an HD movie trailer and it looked great for any of you with a setup like that (cable works both ways, DVI card to HDMI display and vice-versa)

No blocks or stuttering, just a clear picture that fit right to the edges of the screen


But the DVI monitor that this was actually intended for, its manual said 2560x1600 ONLY

Lower resolutions will not work


When the day finally came, the moment of truth, I plugged it in and Windows 7 set it to exactly 1280x800 which looked fine, still high res


My customer, and I, are satisfied.

$REVIEW.: The design of this hub feels solid--it is heavier than most USB hubs and stays put on my desk, even when cables from USB devices are dangling over the edge. I really like the fact that this unit has ports on both sides...for me, this allowed me to attach my fixed devices (like my printer and webcam) to the back ports--keeping them neatly out of sight--while still providing three front ports for more transient devices like my cell phone or digital camera.I've also noticed that this hub does not seem to slow down all devices when a single 1.0 or 1.1 device is attached. My printer is an old HP 930C and my IPod still connects under USB 2.0, even when both are attached.

$review_text.: I had purchased the Toshiba HD-A3 HD-DVD player on Christmas Eve in order to play an HD-DVD formatted movie my daughter was to receive
I had researched Blu-ray and HD-DVD and really couldn't make sense, at the time, on who would be the winner


After Warner's announcement (around 1/11 or so) that it would only support Blu-Ray, the death of HD-DVD was imminent

So, I returned the HD-A3 player to a local retailer for a refund


I also decided that I would not invest in Blu-Ray because of the expensive players and the unsettled versioning

I wasn't about to drop $300+ for a Blu-Ray player only to learn that newer models would be out by year's end


The current models can't be upgraded


Yes, I know Play Station 3's can be upgraded, but right now I don't really need/want a PS3 player.So, I was on a search for a decent up-converting player

The Phillips DVP5982 had high reviews and was a top seller on Amazon


Unfortunately, I ordered my unit from someone else because the price was a little cheaper
Due to the retailer's nearby distribution center, I got it basically overnight compared to waiting 2-3 days for Amazon's shipping.Everything about the Phillips player is easy to operate


The remote is well designed, menu systems are logical


If you are not up on current technology, you may become confused with some of the settings, 780p, 1080p, HDMI, etc

I think the Toshiba HD-A3 player did a better job at upconverting basic DVD's, but this Philips machine does quite a decent job

I'm pleased.The USB port is a nice feature but is rather slow with modern, large jpg files


It is probably faster with scaled down pictures that are not so large in size
I think I'd rather burn the pics to a DVD and view them that way instead of waiting for each to load via USB.Power up time is a little slow

You may wonder if you actually turned it on or not

DVD load time is about average to other players.

You need to add your phone number and ISP information, which is easy to do either in the Network Preferences (under System Preferences) or in the Internet Connect application.

$REVIEW.: I have owned 3 sets of Shure's extremely expensive models in the $600.00 +++ range. So I understand just how the very expensive models sound. What happens over the years is some of the previous high end technology reaches to the affordable introductory models - just like this model. Shure has included several sizes of ear foams for a comfortable set. The sound is very pleasant and gives a very pleasing range with a pleasing bass. I remember many years ago someone giving me their Walkman and telling me how great it sounded. I was polite and not impressed but we have come a long way and these are very good sounding and good value for someone looking for a reasonably priced upgrade.

$review_text.: My unit arrived quickly and works great.  It's quite powerful-- even on low power it can be heard a block away.  I set volume gain to just under 1/2 way up, it sounds good there without being too boomy.Be careful not to overlap a nearby commercial station as it will easily overpower any station within your neighborhood, and that's probably illegal.  Also be aware that this device can tune outside the US FM band, including the aircraft band.  Going above 108MHz is a good way to get in big trouble, so I recommend you don't do that.
$SUMMARY.: good, loud!

$REVIEW.: So the main reason I picked this up was because the auxiliary cord I was using was picking up interference, and why the hell not. I was a little worried that the battery was going to last an hour or less but was pleasantly surprised when it lasted for two 2.5 hour trips. The quality comes in clearer than the cable.When I first turned the unit on my phones volume was maxed out and it came through like my speakers were blown out, just lower the volume a click or two on the phone and you are good to go!I think the unit shuts off automatically if there is no device connected, but haven't had time to really play with it and determine all of these things.

$REVIEW.: I love my Plantronics Voyager Pro+

 I put one in my ear every morning and use it till it dies, then put the next one in


 These are not close in what I would expect from Plantronics


 They don't have smaller earbuds available

 The stock ones are just too big for my ears and make them very uncomfortable

 The killer was when I left the house, all reception dropped


 It appears the antenna is in the wire band, and even If I move my cell phone holster to the middle-back of my belt, no reception
 I use 4 different Bluetooth devices daily and this was the only one with that problem.So if you have big ears and only use this inside, the sound quality & playtime is great.

$review_text.: This cover makes the iPad mini even cooler


 My wife's iPad retina just snapped right into it with a perfect fit


The front lap is red with three foldable sections similar to those you find in expensive Apple cover

It functions the same way, you can fold it to triangle shape and adjust the iPad viewing angles


It is better than Apple cover in that it has a back to protect the iPad
The front cover , when closed, put the iPad into sleep mode


I think the iPad probably could survive a 5-foot drop with the cover on
Of course all the openings are at the right places.What made this cover different from others is the Lego back
Just think about all the cool Lego designs you could build on it! You could practically have a different cover for every day of the week.

$review_text.: The receiver works.What does not work is the fact that I was attempting to use 14g speaker wire and I had to chop that down to about an 18g to be able to insert it into the push pin style connectors. I expected the style of connector, but I didn't expect to have to use CHEAP speaker wire to hook up the speakers. Other than that, it is basic and it works. The sound quality is about average IMHO.

$review_text.: it works somewhat, but I have an airial antenna that picks up better than this one. I took a chance on purchasing because my other antenna is struggling to get signals but picks them up better than this one. Part of my signal issue is trees in the yard. Either way my old antenna picks up better than this one but the caviot of this antenna is when it picks up staions the picture is clearer than my other antenna. With an unobstructed signal this antenna would be a better option & picture. Maybe when I move into my own place it will be better. Its much smaller & compact than my standard ota antenna. Everything works on it & it doesn't spin or move in bad weather or windy days. It is impossible to set by yourself as others have stated every time you push the rotor button it switches direction so there is no way to know where its pointing unless you can set it up in your yard on a pole in plain site through your house window.works well enough that with an unobstructed signal it would be worth its cost. The gain control on it doesn't seem to effect its signal any either which waqs disappointing. But hey its not a high dollar top quality device. I'd say its worth it for the money as you get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and wanted to protect my purchase with a screen protector. I have ordered them off Amazon before so this was the first place I looked. The protectors are much cheaper cost here than at the big box stores.The package I received contained everything you need, 2 microfiber clothes, a squeegee, and the 2 protectors. 1 of the protectors I got had a blemish on it (looked like a little drop of melted plastic.) I e-mailed the company and received a VERY quick response that they would ship me a new set of screen protectors. It is nice to know you are dealing with a company that will look out for you.Application was quick and easy. Make sure that the screen is PERFECTLY cleaned with not even 1 drop of dust on it. I used a little eyeglass cleaning solution and a microfiber cloth. I barely notice that the protector is there. The tablet works just the same, but now my screen is protected. I will definitely purchase a screen protector from this company again in the future.Scott

$review_text.: I read numerous reviews on this camera and read about the flash problem in that you usually put your finger where the flash comes out of the body in the upper left corner (when looking at the screen. I thought that it wouldn't be a big deal and it isn't for my family because we know not to put our finger there. The problem is when you have other people take your picture; they almost always jam the flash which over time will break the flash mechanism.You might wonder why I would still give 4 stars but the picture quality is amazing. The picture quality rivals my Canon SLR 50D. The low light pictures are what really amaze me because of the warmth of the colors. I decided to buy this camera as an SLR replacement because I was tired of lugging around another bag which almost feels like another carry on for all of our trips. I was also getting tired of lugging the SLR to parties or other events and would just leave it at home. Well, it doesn't do you any good if you want to take a picture and you don't have your camera with you. I looked at a few SLR replacements like the Nikon P6000 but in terms of value and picture quality, I decided on the Canon S95 and have been very happy with the purchase!

$REVIEW.: UPDATE: I just noticed this product has been redesigned but apparently has the same product number as the reviews for the previous design have followed this newer version. I have no experience with this new version so take this review with a grain of salt.As you may have noticed there is quite a selection of mini-speaker options available for your portable devices. There are a couple of reasons I selected the Ayl speaker over similar products in this category; 1)it doesn't have a built in cord always attached to the device. I am not a fan of audio cables that can't be replaced especially when it would render the device useless if it were damaged. 2) This device doesn't have any unnecessary moving parts such as a accordion style sound chamber. These types of designs may offer some sound enhancement but will do more to lessen the overall durability and life of the device than they will to improve its sound. There are other things I like about this product and a few cons/considerations too.Pros+ Great sound output, very loud but still clear at higher volumes+ Sound is nicely balanced between highs and lows. Not too sharp or hollow, voices are clear and not muddled+ The sound balance makes it a great speaker for talk as well as music+ Sturdy feel and construction,can and has handled quite a few drops+ Simple design without novelty accordion base chambers or built in sound cables+ Single charge exceeds 10 hours of playtimeCons/Consideration- No standard 3.5mm input jack, instead....- Y style hybrid audio/charger cable is sloppy and not propriety so replacement may be difficult, for this reason minus 1 star- LED power indicator may be bright for some in low light situations- No daisy chaining feature as featured on x-mini but it is important to note that this feature does not produce stereo sound but simply mirrored mono sound out of multiple speakersThis speaker may not be perfect, but it is a great speaker for sub $15 and I highly recommend it

How you can ship a case with the wrong standoffs though is just baffling.  Now I have to purchase 8.5 mm length motherboard mounting standoffs...should have got them at another local vendor today just in case (pun intended?).Apart from that gaff, for which I have to remove a star, its a large, understated & quiet case that looks to fit my needs for the future.

$REVIEW.: I purchased these to use with my iPod when running.  I very much like this style of headphone, and I was originally attracted to the PMX 680 because of its claim to be water and sweat-resistant.  However, after several runs, I started to experience a very bad connection between the headphones and my arm-band mounted iPod.  I would lose sound in one ear-bud or the other, and occasionally I would lose the sound altogether.  Wiggling the jack in the iPod would reestablish the connection for a very short while, but I eventually had to resort to holding the iPod in my hand and maintaining a tight connection between it and the headphones.  This is obviously not the preferred solution, so unfortunately these headphones failed for me.  Subsequently, I did use other headphones, and had no issues with the connectivity whatsoever, so the problem appears to be with the headphone jack, rather than the iPod.If I could break down this review, I would give the actual behind-the-neck design of the headphones five stars, and the sound - understanding that these are sports headphones - four stars.  But when you can't maintain a connection between the headphones and the source of the music, then the design and sound quality are moot.  So unfortunately, these get a single star, and I'm off to look for alternatives.

$REVIEW.: This player perfectly fits my needs. In my used Accord I had a Sony CD player installed and it started skipping tracks and made my life miserable. So I switched to this digital player as I decided to skip CD forever.The audio quality of the player is great considering my original basic Honda speakers of the LX model. It is not premium speakers and it does not benefit from premium stereo. It plays SD and USB both and that is the main reason I bought, and the radio reception is also decent.Regarding the SD card, I was thrilled to find that it accepts SDHC card, as many SD receivers do not do that. I have used both 2 GB SD and 4 GB SDHC card. The only problem is the song selection and organization - there is nothing. It plays according to the order the songs are added to the card, and for me it was the order Windows decided to copy the files from my Hard Disk of my music folder. I had songs organized in folders and sub folders for the type (Rock, Pop, Classical) and artist and album, but this player does not understand any such organization. The only option is to skip 10 songs to probably move to the next album. In a way it is better; as less control is better for road safety.However, my biggest complain is the power/ mute button. I do not see any need for a Mute button in a digital car receiver. If the power is switched off it serves the same purpose of muting the audio. Moreover, if a song was getting played, it stops there itself and when started it starts from there. I normally use this power off in my earlier Sony receiver many times during travel whenever I get a call on my headset. After the call, I switch it on again and the song continues from the same place. For this, I need to pause and for that I have to fish out the small first number button which is also very difficult to get at since it is next to the volume control. The other option is keeping the power button pressed to power it off. Both are cumbersome and bad design.The installation was pretty simple as I was replacing another aftermarket stereo. All the wiring harness and frame was already present. I just had to look in the internet how to open my car stereo and I got help from my mechanic friend to open it without any scratches. Wiring was easy and it worked the first time.Finally I am able to enjoy my music without any skipping and changing disks. All my music fits in a 8GB or 16GB disc and so no changing is required. However, I am planning to use smaller cards for each music type (Rock or classical) as it is impossible to select them on this player.One important thing to note is that the faceplate is not removable for security. Hence, if security is important, it is better to look for other models.

$REVIEW.: Not as in electrical shock; as in shockingly bad


At least indoors
Honestly...I don't even know where to begin


I SO (some pun intended) wanted to love this camera

Everything about it seemed perfect


The zoom range


The ergonomics

The pop up flash
The veiwfinder
The discounted price
The fact that it takes 4 standard AA batteries instead of proprietary, chip-encoded overpriced Li-Ions
I even got it in a kit with a really nice bag and a 4GB Fuji SDHC card


All for $179 at BJ's

I didn't even have to wait for it to arrive


I just drove there, bought it, and brought it home

And that's when things really took a definite turn for the worse.I had been using a Panasonic ZS8 that I'd gotten about a week ago, and I was sure, based on everything I wrote above, that I'd like the Fuji better


In my mind, I had already packed up the ZS8 and sent it back to Amazon, I was so sure I'd prefer the Fuji camera
(I think I even looked at my ZS8 somewhat disparagingly as I was getting ready to test the S3200.)(NOTE: I'd downloaded and read/skimmed the whole 144 page .pdf manual before I started taking any photos with the S3200, so it wasn't as if I was totally unfamiliar with its features.)Then I started taking some casual photos with the S3200, just as I'd done at first with the ZS8 (i.e
zooming in/out, trying photos with and without flash, trying custom settings in the P, S, & A modes, and comparing those shots to the ones taken in Auto mode, etc.)


I was photographing the exact same things I'd been photographing with the ZS8, under the exact same conditions

I figured that was the best/fairest way to get an accurate comparsion


I had found the ZS8 to be tolerable-to-fair in low light/no flash settings, and having read the specs and the reviews, I was hoping that the S3200 would be at least as good, if not better.Well...as they say...we live in hope and die in despair
The results were just flat out abysmal
Forget about the photos being grainy

The ones without flash were just total garbage
And before you even ask...I tried every possible setting (except full Manual) to try to get the photos to look even halfway decent


I tried full auto, scene auto, natural light, natural light with flash, A mode, S mode, and P mode


To no avail


It was a total effort in futility
Even the flash shots, which APPEARED at first to be crisp and clear, all had what can best be described as an "over Photoshopped" look to them at full 100% magnification on the computer screen

You know what I mean, right? Where ALL the detail has been totally smoothed away

It might pass when you're trying for some kind of super smooth skin look in a glamour shot (but even then it tends to look artificial/unnatural), but for regular snapshots, from a supposedly good camera? I don't think so


I did manage to squeeze out somewhat better results in "P" mode, after hitting the proprietary/magic "F" button (don't tempt me, it wouldn't take much at this point), and lowering the ISO to 100

But again...it was way too little, way too late.There was also noticeable barrel distortion at the widest zoom setting (24mm focal length) on the S3200, whereas there was no such distortion from the identical shots taken with the ZS8 at the same 24mm focal length


So what good is it to have a 24mm super zoom lens that can't even take a simple, straight, undistorted picture? I didn't even bother taking the camera outdoors
If it can't take a decent picture indoors, what good is it?And as others have noted...it's really SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW to focus (if you can even GET it to focus)
Forrest Gump slow


Molasses slow


Just gawd awful slow


It's even slow/sluggish when you're panning to compose the shot
It's like it's panning in semi-slow motion
It's not too slow to recycle after a flash shot

And it is pretty quick to zoom
But that's about it.I took around 100 shots, and maybe got 4 or 5 out of that bunch that were decent/useable


That's just very very sad


And as I stated at the outset...I REALLY wanted to like this camera
Fortunately, I didn't have to pay any shipping to get it here, and I won't have to pay any shipping to get it back.Now some folks might think that giving this camera 2 stars is harsh, because I admit I never even took it outside
But as far as I'm concerned, any camera that can't even take a decent indoor shot without it looking like it'd been Photoshopped to death (with flash), or taken with a black sock over the lens (without flash) is a below average performer, IMO


I will say that in kit form it came with a nice bag, and a nice 4gb Fuji card, and the price was more than reasonable, at least now that it's being discounted rather heavily


But to put your life's memories in the hands of this underperformer just doesn't make much sense to me.The big lesson clearly to be learned from all of this is that you cannot assume that just because a camera has a great spec sheet it's going to take great pictures
There's obviously a lot of stuff going on under that black plastic cover that determines the quality of the final photos; stuff that rarely if ever makes it to the spec sheets

And unfortunately, the Fuji S3200 totally misses the mark.As somewhat of an aside, the S3200 is definitely a smart little sucker
If you happen to turn the camera on without having first removed the lens cap, it'll give you a semi-polite, but stern warning: "Turn Off The Camera And Turn On Again"
(At least it was polite enough not to say: "YOU LEFT THE LENS CAP ON, DUMMY!!") By the same token, it gives no indication whatsoever that the warning is related to the lens cap having been left on


When it first appeared I thought it was something much more serious

(Towards the end of the manual, in the "Warnings" section, it does mention that particular warning, but it does not say it has anything to do with the lens caps being on at the time the camera is turns on


I'm assuming that the two are connected since that warning only appeared when the lens cap left was on at the time the camera was turned on, and never appeared when the lens cap was off.) So now it's my turn to offer up a warning: "RUN DO NOT WALK TO THE NEAREST CUSTOMER SERVICE COUNTER AT BJ'S (or Amazon or wherever) TO RETURN THIS CAMERA!"(On a more jovial note...I would swear that my Panasonic ZS8 gave me a very smug, disparaging look as I was boxing up the S3200


If cameras could talk (and I think some of then can/do) my ZS8 would be saying: "NAH NAH NA NAH NAH!!!")

$review_text.: The case that comes with it is yes smaller and lighter. It does how ever seem less durable but I think it will be fine. The glass lens protector is much more vulnerable to damage. Its pretty much out there. The # has a lip around it so if you were to for example place it lens down on a surface, it wouldn't make contact. The 3+ would. The extra and replacement cases are quite expensive. But on a good note. The camera's. The 3 and the 3+ are virtually the identical size. I realize they are different in capabilities, but size wise there identical. Which means, and Ive tried it out, that you can interchange cases. If youd like to accessorize your 3+ with cheaper options that are marketed for the 3 you can, or if you prefer the smaller lighter cases for the 3+ you could use them with your 3. Everything fits and lines up the same.  The 3+ cases are just smaller, thinner, lighter. And they do have a simpler latching system. Instead of the push to the side and pull back simultaneously and bash your fingers the first few times you use it  until you master it. They have a simple common latch. Super spendy though. I will definitely accessorize with Hero3 cases. They seem more durable, cheaper to buy and if needed maintain. Image quality and usability of course is as expected from GoPro. Fantastic.

$review_text.: Ok here's the deal on the MiniDriveI don't know what came first the nifty drive or this one but the build quality on this unit is not what I was expecting when I first opened the package. All this thing is is a modified Micro SD card adaptor all fancied up to fit flush in the SD card slot of the computer.The tool works as its intended but on my Mac the transfer speeds are not what I was expecting. Using the disk speed test tool I was able to get very good read speeds at 44 MB/s, but write speeds were lacking at 10MB/s.I loaded up a session in Studio One with 24 tracks of audio streaming from the drive. It actually tracked nicely with no issues. My session was with 24 physical audio files.  I need to test the drives ability to keep up after i have made a massive amount of edits to thise tracks and i have multiple refrences that the software is going go have to refrence.Going to test this drives ability to record 24 tracks at the same time and see what happens soon. Will update soon as I get that done.So far so good with this device. $30 bucks is way too expensive for this. If it had better build quality. I wouldn't mind paying this much. $10 bucks is a much better price point for this device. The nifty drive has way better feel, intergrated removal tool, better build quality and it is cheaper.  This is a great fall back device if the nifty drive is out of stock, which it was at the time of this review.

$review_text.: The sound was excellent considering the size and portability as well as the volume. Originally bought the XBOOM and Kinivo ZX100 to compare.  Sent the other one back since sound quality not as good as the XBOOM.  So placed another order and purchased 2 of these to take on vacation to connect to MP3 player.  Connected them together with great sound in our room and patio or on the beach.  Third day of use, one would not expand and the next day the other did the same.  They both open up about 3/4 of an inch.  Lifted to expand fully and both go right back to slight expansion.  Did absolutely nothing incorrect to cause the problem.  When they were new out of the box, they unlocked and fully expanded sounded great..  When finished listening, pushed back together and slight turn to lock.  Same process until the 3rd day and then the problem.  Thought maybe environment had something to do with it.  Got home and they do the same thing.  They still sound alright but like listening in a tin can.  Would not recommend them.  As I said, they sounded great to begin with then became faulty.  Hard time deciding between 2-3 stars.  As I said they still work but sound quality is only a little better then speakers on my tablet, or phone.* Update*  Seller contacted me and replaced immediately!  Excellent Customer service! Everything is not 100% and they made it right.  The speakers are great and working fine!  I recommend these to anyone wanting convenience for travel with great sound.  Using them tonight hooked to my laptop listening to music while I work.  Make a great compliment to my Sansa Fuze.  Thanks to the SELLER for taking the time to contact me.  I was not going to send them back since they still worked.  I liked the size even though they did not sound as good as new.  The new ones sound great and expand all the way for good base out of such a tiny speaker.

$review_text.: Finally! A good overall DVD recorder, player and Dubbing machine! The Best features are the VERY clear recordings and live view having clear HD picture.  The only bummer is there is no pass through feature (when you shut down the Toshiba recorder) allowing the sound and picture to continue sending signals to your stereo and HDTV.I was impressed with the quality of recordings most of all. Dubbing had no synch problems from tape to disc.This unit is an overall winner. Hands down it has the best reproduction.  Learning the quirky way to navigate takes some adjusting. Finalizing a disc also is more steps than other recorders which offer a disc menu and quick choice to finalize. But once you get onto the programming and sub menu's ...it does have the main things covered. The best so far!

$review_text.: I bought 3 of these
One for my self and the other 2 for friends with tablets


As soon as they are hooked up the tablet registered the keyboard immediately, for that I am extremely happy

Two keyboards are working perfect except for one

On one of the keyboard/case, the grips that are supposed to hold the tablet seem to be sprained so it does not hold the tablet secure and therefore it slides out of the case easily and also the shift key is not working so I am unable to access any of the top layer symbols of the keys that have two symbols that you need the shift key to access them
So that is why I did not give this product 5 stars


But the other 2 that I bought for my friends are working perfectly fine so I guess this third one just came faulty
I will have to purchase a different case for my tablet now because I can't take the chance of it slipping out the case and then it makes no sense if I have to unplug the keyboard to use the onscreen keyboard when I need a &#34;shift&#34; key symbol.

$review_text.: I bought this keyboard to use with my Surface Pro but I am currently using it on my primary Windows 7 computer.I like the size and I found it easy to convert from a 'standard' keyboard


 Good feel to the keys.Issues I had to find fixes for:The keyboard would go to sleep and I would miss the first letter or two when typing
 It would sleep after less than 30 seconds
 This seems to be a bug in Bluetooth 3.0 under Windows 7

 Adjusting the Bluetooth properties to not allow Bluetooth to power down the keyboard solved the problem.No insert key

 This is the only key I miss and I use it a lot in Word.My solution was to add the Overtype command to the Quick Access Ribbon Bar.Clicking on the icon turns Insert on/off.Other:The keyboard lies flat with no 'legs' to rise it up
 You can purchase stick-on 'legs'


 Search for  Laptop legs.However flat works for me.

$REVIEW.: The pad does work as advertised, when the laptop begins to heat up.As the pad heats up, however, this effect diminishes and can actually serve to increase the overall heat.The crystals liquify after absorbing the heat, and the pad flattens (reducing air flow beneath laptop) and becomes a heat source in itself.  This not only removes the desired effect but may contribute to the heat as it does in my case.I'm not recommending against using this.  Just be sure it suits your needs (1-2 hour computing sessions and a shutdown for a while) or you don't mind adding a second to rotate while one cools down and crystalizes back to original form.It's just not an effective cooler for any length of time.

$review_text.: For the great price, these are a decent set of speakers.  The sound is somewhat tinny, and there is very little bass.  They don't produce a lot of sound either; they are only suitable for a small room.  They are a good option for someone on a very low budget (good for a dorm room), or someone looking for an inexpensive set of extra speakers.  They appear to be very portable, but what they don't show you in the product photo is that the speakers are wired to the main unit.  They're also a bit heavier than I expected them to be.  Although I have managed to carry all three pieces from one room to another without dropping anything, it wasn't easy.  If I wanted to take these to the beach or a picnic or on a trip, I would probably pack them up in the box they came in to prevent them from getting banged up.  It would have been great if they had devised a gadget with a handle to allow you to carry all the pieces easily, but they didn't.  I've also had some issues with getting the speaker unit to turn off when I have my iPod Classic plugged in (I also have an iPod Touch and I haven't had the same problems with it).  In addition I've had problems turning the volume up/down when my Classic is plugged in; it's as if the speakers freeze up.  I'm hoping this won't affect the performance of the speakers.  Another bonus to this unit is that it charges your iPod as you play music through the speakers.

$REVIEW.: Even with all of the positive reviews for the product, I was skeptical
I needed to read a friend's old IDE hard drive from an old laptop and the Windows XP installation on that HD was corrupt


The enclosure arrived with everything advertised (including all of it's screws) and was simple to put together


The screw holes on the case weren't perfectly lined up with the IDE adaptor, but they worked fine
The USB interface worked great with my other computer and I was able to read/write to the old IDE drive


My friend was very thankful that I was able to help her retrieve her old data from the drive and I was able to do all this for only $6!

$REVIEW.: Compared to Similar Drives:I've owned the drive for about 8 months, and must say that I've loved it from day one. Similar Raid drives that I've had experience with have either burned out or have noisy fans. I also use the Lacie Rugged portable drive. With my MacBook Pro, I've used both intensely with great results. I've had experience with many other Raid and portable drives.Cooling and Noise:Since the hard drives are mounted next to eachother by the skinny side, and not by the fat side like most Raids, they do not generate so much heat for eachother. The drive stays very cool, even after intense hours of running during massive video encoding or batch picture processing. This is also helped since the stress is spread across drives. As mentioned, most Raid's are like a 747 with noise and still stay very hot. This drive is calm, stable, and quite, no matter what you do to it.Speed:Even when daisy-chaining two other HD's and a scanner, this thing is still blazing. With a 100gb transfer of pictures, I clocked it at around 80-100 mb/s. When copying and pasting, it makes a light noise, rather than a loud chug chug clack clack from one side of the HD to the other.Travel and Wear:As a transient college student, I have traveled many time with this drive with no problems. Its been subjected to cheep air conditioners and heaters, along with very humid dorm rooms. No problems, always ran without a hitch. Even though the drive is thin, it still stays very stable with its heavy metal stand.Quality:This thing is a beauty and looks its price. The case and vertical stand are made of solid metal, and you can feel its weight and quality. Its connections are tight and well located. The cooling system is quiet and worked fanastically.Other Reviews:Unfortunately with high-end HD's, who are mostly bought by busy professionals, buyers seem to only take the time to review if they've had a bad experience. Would you write your congressmen to tell him you were happy? If you look at reviews of other Raid drives, such as Western Digital, you'll see similar bad reviews, people saying they switched to Lacie. Those drives are genuinely noisy and have other concerns, however. You don't know if people are throwing things on top of them or knocking them around all of the time, or tearrying them out while there processing data. Overall, a great product product.
$SUMMARY.: Great for Video and Photo Enthusiasts

$review_text.: As I said, this product works exactly as advertised. I am very pleased with the performance. Even though the unit indicates I have a poor quality connection (red status light, likely due to distance) I achieve about ~2-3 MB/s on a LAN transfer. This is more than enough for mine and most applications.To touch on the distance thing, I have a ~1800 sq ft home and I use 2 wall units from one side clear to the other and achieve the lower end of the performance spectrum... So if you are intending to do the same, expect similar results. I have not tested the units in closer proximity, I have no doubt they must be blazing fast when paired closer to one another.They are expensive, but so is a wiring project for the whole house. And the other benefit to these units is if/when I move, they are coming with me.

$REVIEW.: I have had my Sirius Stiletto since November 2006, and I love it! Had a problem with the extended battery suddenly dying, but I called the Sirius Warranty Center and they swapped out an entire new replacement unit quickly to me


I am very happy with the Stiletto


Four stars only because of the unusable antenna headphones, no Macintosh compatibility for the Yahoo Music Service/MP3 transfer, and the fact that you can't use the remote control directly with the unit (has to be plugged into the home or car kit)
Sirius is now offering a FREE car kit with purchase (too late for me, though!).I am using this in the Princeton NJ area, my live satellite signal using the home kit and window antenna is mostly two bars, but my house is directly next to a tall forest of trees--I may have to install an outdoor antenna for maximum signal


If I place only the Stiletto unit in my window it gets a usable signal just using its internal antenna pointed outwards! The Stiletto easily connects to my Apple home Wifi Airport Express, so I can listen to Sirius Internet at home as well! Just walking around outdoors, if you are near a repeater you will get a great live signal even with no antenna
Otherwise, the headphone antenna is adequate but as everyone else has said, very weird looking and painful to wear.At work I am using a home kit and window antenna, and the live Sirius signal is at full strength since I work near a terrestrial ground repeater, so I can record hours and hours of whatever I want daily for later listening in the "Replays" mode (Replays are saved as each individual channel you listened to previously, so it's easy to select what you want later--also, the channels automatically append new recorded material as you start and stop recording daily)
This is what I use in my car so I don't even need to hook up the Stiletto car kit


If I do want live Sirius Satellite mobile reception, the car kit gets excellent strong signals everywhere
 I like the fact that I can operate the Stiletto in my car or at home with the remote control also!At home I can wirelessly control the docked Stiletto via remote extender from anywhere in the house, broadcasting the Stiletto to a Sennheiser wireless transmitter and listening to the output on wireless speakers or wireless Sennheiser headphones anywhere as well, even outdoors!  Or I can hook an audio output cable directly to a home stereo


Sweet!The sleek interface is impressive

 Sirius smoothly sends firmware and program channel upgrades automatically to the unit (even over Wifi!)

Also useful are the weekly emails that Sirius sends me for Music and Sports events/program updates which are great for keeping on top of all the programming choices!SIRIUS AND XM MERGER? Now that Sirius and XM have announced a tentative merger (barring FCC interference, since there is a Federal law stating that Satellite providers cannot purchase each other), it will be interesting to see how their separate programming is merged as well


In an ideal world, I would want to combine all of Sirius' existing programming with just a couple of XM's unique programs like Bob Dylan's show...that would be awesome...hope they don't screw up the programming!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this for my office and it works great (with two amps and multiple speakers mounted in the ceiling).I typically use it to stream Pandora (which has been ad-free without a paid subscription), and I also use it to stream my iTunes library off my Apple Time Capsule. Both work flawlessly.I liked it so much that I purchased the Sonos Play 5 for home, and a number of people who have heard it in my office have done the same. The Play 5 is also very good and everyone I know who has purchased it has been thrilled, but that's a whole other review.I have found two small downsides to this system that I think are worth mentioning...First, you have a do a silly work-around to use the same controller in multiple locations (in my case each of our iPhones and some iPads). You can only tie your iPhone/iPad to one Sonos device or the other out of the box. This is a well-documented issue, and Sonos offers a work-around. I understand the limitations of the technology they are using but I think their iOS app could be smart enough to negotiate this so I don't have to.Second, the iPhone app still isn't updated for the iPhone 5, which has been out for at least six months at the time of this writing. This is the first comment each one of my clients has made when I show them the system. It's not that big of a deal to me, but I don't think it reflects well on Sonos.That said, the user interface of the app appears a bit dated but is very logically designed and user friendly.The shortcomings listed above are minor compared to what you get in this package, it really is a fantastic device. I would purchase both the CONNECT and Play 5 again knowing the downsides.

I kept putting in different fresh AAA batteries to no avail; it failed to power up even with the MP3 player unlocked (there is a lock/unlock switch you can slide back and forth).  I plugged the MP3 player into 3 different computers and none of the computers recognized its existence on the USB port.  BTW, it did not ever fall to the ground or sustain any hard impact.  I have two older models from RCA and they work fine.  This newer blue RCA Pearl unit is far from being a jewel;  ironically, it offers the most disappointment among my RCA MP3 players.

I ended up buying a case with a bluetooth keyboard so when I want to do serious work (e.g. long email for my job) I can be more productive..And that's where it really shines for me.  Yes, I can read books, play media, and browse the internet, but what I'm loving is that I can get my corporate email on it and work on Office docs seamlessly while on the road, something I can't do with my wife's iPad.Skydrive mounts as just another folder in explorer, so dragging & dropping files back and forth from the cloud to the device is seamless and natural.  I use this a lot because not everywhere has good wi-fi, or wi-fit at all.  Or even cell reception (so tethering doesn't get me anything).There are more and more apps for the Win platform now so aside from a game or two I haven't found anything I need that hasn't been available for the platform.My wife has been an iPad addict since the v1, and I'm seeing her use my Venue more and more as the weeks go on, for the same reasons I cited above (productivity).Just like the Nokia 920 with Win8 was the first WinPhone that was worth moving away from the iPhone for, this is the first 8" Win tablet that I think is worth the money, esp. as it really is more than an entertainment device, which is all most tablets are good for.My next task is hooking it up to a full 23" monitor and keyboard/mouse (just need to order and adapter), and then I can get rid of my laptop too.

$REVIEW.: Ordered these due to the kids not being able to hear the dvd system we installed in our pickup! I was skeptical at first but read the reviews and decided to try them out! We have a 14&#34; Pyle dvd system and all we had to do was put the batteries in and turn on the headphones and there we go, HAPPY KIDS!!! And no fighting!! Oh how HAPPY mom and dad are on car trips now!!! I would HIGHLY recommend these! Inexpensive and easy to use!!! We got 5 pair, and would buy more. They do look like they r cheaply made but if they can withstand our 5 kids from the ages of 8-14 and not break, then they are worth every penny!! VERY, VERY HAPPY we bought these!!

$REVIEW.: This is an excellent high quality case with enough room for just about anything you want to put in it. there are two minor problems I have but its not even enough for me to take off a star. First, the rubber grommets on the inside for cable management have a tendency to come off when running cables through. when running the cables you will have to ether hold the grommet or you can just glue it in. the other problem I have is that the seem between the top and the from panel is not perfect after taking it off. I have taken it off and put it back on a few times to try and get it to fit right but cant get it exact. It is not a big problem though because it is only slightly off and it doesn't really bother me

$REVIEW.: I've had it a week and its going back tomorrow. I don't want a long review but gist of it is the fans on this unit do not put out enough air to cool me Toshiba 14" laptop that is 2.5 years old. If you put it on a softer surface such as on your bed to surf or read or what have you it sinks into anything that is not rock hard and the fans cannot cool as they cannot get air. The pictures make the rear higher looking that it is and the rubber feet keep falling off. I previously had the #1 seller for cooling notebook pads on Amazon the Cooler Master NotePal X2 Laptop Cooling Pad with 140mm fan and I think I just got a bad one as I am going back to it as it cooled perfectly its just the screen kept popping off. I do not know how they can claim the 2 fan model can handle a 17" laptop as my 14" laptop was hanging over the sides. There are also tons of wires to deal with when picking up and moving from the fans. One fan also just stopped working.I just really think that most would be much happier with another model as I have no idea how this got such a high rating. I give it 2 starts as it did cool a bit so its not as though its 100% junk but if your laptop is like mine and runs very hot this will not cut it. I also wish it was like the afore mentioned model and the rear was up higher.Thanks.
$SUMMARY.: Don't let the ratings fool you this is a poor design

$REVIEW.: Very nice headphones that I would otherwise give 4.5 stars but the price gives it that last half point to make it a five.  The only problem I have with these headphones is the highs are not crystal clear.  On the other hand it's 12 bucks -- for headphones at that price they actually sound better than others that are twice that price.One thing that is surprising is that the headphones seem to block out quite a bit of noise.  I tried to use them for making skype telephones and found them a little annoying because it blocked out too much of my own voice (felt like my ears were plugged).  Though that sounds bad, for many things, that's a good thing.One last thing -- and this is a biggie if you have an older player that is starting to loose it's headphone connection causing channel drop outs -- this has a gold plated jack.  Any of you who have experienced what I'm talking about, you know that gold plated headphone jacks will make the connection better than standard metal.  For this, I'd actually give this a 5.5.I got these to test them and I think I may be getting more.  Headphones go bad and I have kids -- these are goodness.  Thank you JVC!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this to use with my MacBook Air. It works great since it doesn't require a separate power supply. I can plug it into a USB port on my MacBook and it's ready to use!Not only does this allow my MacBook Air (which doesn't have any type of optical drive to begin with) to read CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs, but it also lets me write Blu-ray Discs which is the main reason that I purchased it. Using single layer discs you can get 25GB on a single disc. The double layer discs can store up to 50GB but they are more expensive than just buying two of the single layer discs. These are great for making an additional backup of photos just so you have a permanent copy that can't be overwritten or damaged by magnetic fields like hard drives can be.Slim, no external power supply, plug and play with Mac, and writes Blu-ray Discs.... exactly what I was looking for!

$review_text.: Hat's off to the OPPO team once again! One of the things about buying an OPPO is it's resale value over other electronics, I don't know of too many brands you can have for over a year and resale it for almost what you paid for it. I just sold my BDP-93 for $449 and my BDP-83 I had for more than 2 years before that for $429 (Both retailed for $499). I was able to sell my BDP-93 and an Emotiva XDA-1 and only pay a little more than $500 to up grade to this player. WOW! Now comes the BDP-105, I'm not going to get into how fantastic it sounds with BD's, DVD's, CD's and as a DAC, every one else has had there say on that and I can't say anymore than that as I agree with everything. I will say that the picture from my Directv HD-24 is so much better run through the 105's HDMI back input instead of directly to my Panasonic Plasma HDTV that it's scary. Not only is the picture better, but the clarity in sound is far better also in my system, instead of having the audio hooked up through the optical digital to my Pre-Pro. I had the OPPO BDP-105 hooked up directly to my power amps but didn't seem have enough volume, at least for me anyways, so I ended up hooking it up to the multi-channel input on my Integra DCT 9.8. Now I have volume galore! I run the Integra as a volume boost only with all processing, including Audyssey, turned off, and did the speaker calibration's with the OPPO along with bass management. I must say that with the high hopes I had for this unit they were excided well beyond my expectations. Super highly recommended! And now with DSD decoding through the USB, makes it more of a no- brainer!

$review_text.: I've seen some reviews where users are having some difficulty setting the controllers on properly, however I have not had any issues with this at all.  It only took my 5 year old son 2 tries until he mastered it, so it is certainly family friendly.You do need to make sure that you have a place where the controllers are not going to be knocked out, as they are not locked in extremely snug, and the cord isn't exceedingly long, however they certainly fit in snug enough.  With the glowing red and green indicators, and the angle at which they are placed, it makes for a nice looking design that induces my family members to actually put the controllers away when they are finished rather than just leaving them around various parts of the living room (plus they keep them charged!)  Overall very pleased with my purchase.

$review_text.: Bought this item last December as a gift to my daughter. At a price of $59 then, it was a real bargain. However, last week I accidentally hit a door knob while the camera was strung in my hand and the LCD display hit the metal knob. It was a slight bump but when I turned the camera on the LCD dispay would not turn on. Also there was what look like liquid inside the lower right portion of the display and that's when I realized the display itself might be damaged. I can still take pictures but without a working display I could not compose a scene, look at the finish photos, or change settings. There is no alternative viewfinder so the camera is practically useless. So folks, be very careful not to hit the LCD display on any hard object.

$review_text.: I have a daughter with a handicap who loves music


 I put a stereo in her room

 She also eventually got a computer in her room
 She takes her music on the school bus and other places where noise is an issue for her
 So to make things easier we got her an mp3 player and of course ended up with her favorites on the computer as well
 Her room got a bit crowded with everything and becoming difficult to get her wheelchair and other equipment around
 So I learned of the Audio Engine and thought if this sounds like it says I could just have my daughter use the computer to play her music and take the stereo out

 So I ordered up a pair.Out of the box and hooked up for the first time my impression was they didn't sound much better than other speaker systems heard at the mass market stores for less money

 But, I know from experience that good speakers and headphones require a break in period

 I turned on the computer's music player and let the speakers play all day and most of the night
 Each time I checked I could tell I was on the right track


 After those several hours of break in the speaker system sounded impressive for their size


 They had more bass than what I expected from a driver that size


 The speaker's frequency response was balanced, the speaker wasn't bright due to the small bass driver nor was the bass bloated or exaggerated, just a nice balance from top to bottom end


 The tonal quality of the speakers is very good, meaning voices and instruments sounded natural.My one complaint is that the speakers do not have grills

 After spending this much money for speakers for a childs computer I'm afraid a finger could end up in one of them

 Even as adult we can't guard our computer all the time from children or careless others

 It would be nice to have a grill or protective cover when not in use
 I like the glossy black finish and the speakers have like a rubber mat on bottom to prevent harm to furniture and provide isolation from whatever they sit on.In short the A2's are a high performance small package that will provide you with quality sound.

$REVIEW.: This is my 4th BL-C30A camera

 They have all given good service
 We use them for remote security monitoring of our home, and they do the job just fine


 If you are knowledgeable about networks, port forwarding, assigning IPs, MAC addresses, wireless modes, setting encryption keys, etc

you will have no trouble setting this camera up


 If not, you'll need to read the manual carefully, and read your router/access point manual carefully
 Or get a friend who knows all this to help you set it up
 One wrong setting in the camera or your router, firewall, or access point and it won't work (not the fault of the camera - you just have to know what you're doing)


 Best to set it up wired via a LAN cable to your router first, then go wireless


 Once set up, they provide good coverage via the pan and tilt controls, and - if selected to do so - will send you an e-mail and/or a snapshot of a picture when motion is detected

 They are not rated for exterior use, but they will work outdoors if not in direct sunlight and not subjected to extreme heat or moisture

 Cold does not seem to hurt them, but I lost one to heat after several months in direct sunlight


 I have had another one under a patio in the shade for almost a year with no ill efects
 They also have the ability to recognize a connection from a mobile device such as a PDA or cell phone with internet capability
 They will send you a snapshot picture instead of streaming video (thus holding down connection costs), and you can then move the camera using your preset buttons and get another snapshot

 It does not have exceptional night vision, but if you have outdoor lighting or motion activated floodlights, it sees well enough to tell you what's going on

 This camera is priced about right for the features you get.

$review_text.: This small component will get you back up and running with the combination of Bose SoundDock II and SoundDock 10.  These Bose speakers are pricey investments and were compatible with iPod up to the newest Touch.  Best I can figure, the angle of the docking mechanism was changed by Apple to accommodate the thin form.  The SoundDocks don't fit the new angle and if forced will break your new Touch.  These two Bose SoundDocks are still compatible with previous iPods.  For some reason the Portable is not an issue.The SendStation Dock Extender allows the 4th gen (and all previous models) to charge and play with both the Sound Dock II and SoundDock 10.Bose: if you are listening, this is a solution involving no re-engineering.  Possible "good-will" inclusion with new purchases of either of these SoundDock models (II and 10)Apple: if you are listening,  I checked in a number of your retail stores where you stock both of these models and the floor staff were clueless that the new iPod Touch doesn't work with Bose SoundDocks II or 10.  Stocking the extender is the answer to a "Happy Customer" experience.  As opposed to the return of the speakers and the broken iPod.I am so pleased with this solution so I don't have to juggle my music all around, back to older iPod models in order to use my speakers!

$review_text.: I have had the VX2000 for a couple of months now and I've shot countless hours of footage for a couple of low-to-no budget independent movies (and more in the making) and this camera is fantastic! It can be incredibly easy to use yet quite flexible if you need it to be

 No, it's not a palm-sized recorder that you'll be toting casually to family get-togethers and if that's really your only need for a camcorder, go with something smaller, lighter, and less expensive

 However, for those who want to play on the edge of prosumer recorders, this camera is a joy to have

Beyond picture quality there's also sound quality

 The VX2000 records STEREO sound unlike most lower end camcorders and I can't imagine using anything else now

For the down-side of things, yes, it is rather hefty though I find the extra weight actually helps with smoother motion and the battery that comes with it is completely inadequate for any lengthy shooting "in the field"
 The optionally purchased bigger batteries do add to the weight but you won't run out of power in the middle of that important shot if you get the largest one
 (I can shoot all weekend and never drain a single one of those big babies and I have two in my kit.)  It doesn't come with a camera bag or case and you really need something to protect the investment

 (I purchased the hard body aluminum case made for the VX2000 and though it's big and bulky, my camera can breeze through on-location shots without fear of injury

Another investment that you will want to consider with this camera is a tripod but when selecting a tripod make sure you take the camera's weight in consideration


And if you want to play further, check out the Sony gun/zoom mike that works great with this camera, the optional hotshoe light for casual shooting, the lens filters, the...

 Well, you get the idea

 Personally, I've played with one of the smaller, lighter consumer Sony camcorders and absolutely loved it but I wanted more beef, better quality recordings, and greater flexibility because of my involvement in independent movies


 Is this camera overkill for the average consumer?  Certainly!  Is it great?  You betcha'!  Do I regret investing serious bucks in the VX2000?  Heck no!  I would gladly recommend this camera TO everyone but not FOR everyone

 Judge what you really need and really want before purchasing a VX2000 because, for most people, it IS overkill and the purchase of the camera itself is just the first investment
You can easily double the price of the camera by the time you get done with a case, batteries, charger, filters, special mics, windscreen, camera cover, light, etc., etc
 Obviously many of the optional accessories you can do without but once you have the camera it will be that much harder to resist getting that really neat camera stabilizer or that LANC zoom/focus controller or....

$REVIEW.: I love this keyboard/mouse combo. I've had it for 6 months now and my enthusiasm is as high as the day I received it. This set replaced a Microsoft set that had gotten tired after a year or so. During that year I had to put up with non-intuitively placed mouse buttons that would either cause me to surf back a page or would unexpectedly magnify the page I was viewing by a factor of 10 or so. After time, the keyboard would only transmit within 3 inches of the receiver. What a relief! I have NONE of these or any other problems with this Logitech combo. The mouse fits my rather large palm and thumb very ergonomically. There are no buttons that my digits naturally rest on, causing unintended actions. I thought that maybe the keyboard's palm rest would prove to be intrusive, but it actually enhances my hand positions when typing, and now I can't imagine a keyboard without this feature. I don't type well with some of the smaller keyboards and those on laptops, but this one is a normal size.I particularly appreciate the dedicated calculator and eject buttons off to the right of the F buttons. My tower doesn't have a DVD eject button at the drive itself, so before this keyboard I had to go into My Computer, find that drive, right click on it and select "eject". Now I can just hit the button on the keyboard. I often need a calculator, and it's really handy to have a dedicated button for it, rather than having to find its icon on my desktop. Also the sound on/off loud/less loud buttons are very handy. There is a battery condition indicator that still shows fully charged after 6 months of daily use.One small flaw may be the fact that the mouse's scroll wheel doesn't keep the page on a defined position when the wheel has been used then released. The page will move up, then down. Up, then down, as if it needs a parking brake. There is a physical button just behind the wheel though which provides detents to the wheel's movements and also provides the needed "parking brake" to the scroll wheel. So the solution is right there when this becomes irritating. Not having this button selected allows freewheeling of the wheel which is very handy for quickly scanning a page, so I usually leave the button in the "freewheel" position.Logitech hit the ball out of the park on this combo and I'm glad I was fortunate enough to find it in the sea of possible purchases when I was in need of a replacement keyboard/mouse.

$review_text.: I love this computer, but it is ergonomically horrible


I have been using Macintosh Powerbooks for the last eight years and it was an ergonomic gem


The working surface of the laptop was curved and I never once experienced pain while typing, even if I spent 10 hours a day typing


The Macbook has a sharp edge that cuts into my palms & wrists and it causes so much pain I have to stop typing.I have no idea how designers could or would create a laptop with such a horrible flaw
I work at NASA and we work tirelessly on the ergonomics of every design to lessen the impact on astronauts
It is mindboggling how Apple designers could be so careless in the design of their laptops.They probably only cared about 'how it looked' instead of how it functioned


I know if I designed this computer I would NEVER have made such a ridiculous blunder


Why would Apple stray away from a perfectly designed laptop (the Powerbook) and go to a hard edged design
Hell, why didn't they just put razor blades on the edge where your wrists rest? Are you listening Apple designers? Or do you care? Probably not...Related Info: I ordered this computer because it was the last Mac laptop to have a flat screen

Apple seems to have sold out to the PC world by going exclusively to glossy screens

There are no advantages to glossy screens

They give so much glare you can't even see what you are doing, especially if you are in public

Glossy screens render laptops useless outside because you can't even see the display
This is another huge blunder Apple is making.When are corporations going to start designing what the consumer wants instead of forcing stupid designs on consumers?  Hey Apple, how about hiring me at $500,000 a year so I can straighten out your designs? That salary would be dirt cheap, because with the better designs I would create it would lead to more HAPPY customers
Isn't that what companies are SUPPOSED to do???Dumb, dumb, dumb...

$review_text.: When if finally came time to replace my aging wireless router I went to Cnet.com for the reviews,they pointed me to this router.I was a bit apprehensive after reading several owner reviews that were less than spectacular to say the least. However most were on track and while absolutely loving the hardware they hated the firmware / interface.When the unit arrived I powered it up connected it to my laptop with a Ethernet cable and the first thing I did was update the firmware to the latest release(1018i). I preconfigured my wireless settings, SSID's and passwords. I chose to name my 2Ghz and 5Ghz wireless SSID's and passwords separately so I could control all aspects of where my devices connected.Then I replaced my existing router with the Asus and it was off to the races.I pretty much left most settings alone on the router and so far its worked great!!I have a dual band bridge I setup on 5ghz to stream video from the routers connected usb drive to my blueray player and it didn't drop a frame. While that streaming was on my intranet I was also maxing out my internet download connection on the 2ghz line at 3mbyte/sec!! So I have to agree with the reviews this router is fast and easy and best of all stable.I also found that while my old Linksys router WRT160NL would drop the connection on a extended download, so far the Asus router has been flawless. I'm a happy camper and that's NOT easy.

$REVIEW.: I miss Aereo. A lot. Thanks US Supreme Court - for nothing.Meanwhile, for about $200.00 more - which you'll probably never see again - and a more expensive monthly subscription, you can get the basics of what Aereo offered (I assume they kept the Aereo service plain and simple until the court outcome was known) plus a lot of not so important bells and whistles.I've had few problems with the Tivo box itself - except for the elsewhere noted weak tuners - and I, for one, found the phone support timely and useful. But, other than prettier colors and (clumsy) extra menus, this is a upgraded VCR+TV Guide. There are, however, currently few alternatives that are so basically plug and play. Call it "DVR for Dummies" and leave it at that.(The "weak tuners," by the way, is a tricky point. Tivo says they need an 80% signal to record over-the-air (OTA) programming. A modern HDTV can assemble a signal with about 20% +/- signal, so people may go nuts to find their Tivo not working well, or, not at all, when their TVs, meanwhile, work fine. In practice, we've found that a signal of about 35% is the minimum for us. (We found this out because of a bad RG6 connection we had to track down; a bad connection affects all stations, but you notice it more on the weaker stations.) Above 35% things seem to be "gold." The Tivo does provide a way to look at all the tuners and what they are currently up to. This can be handy if one station works well and another doesn't. Try "Setting and Messages"/"Account and System Info"/"DVR Diagnostics" to get a solid idea of what you Tivo is doing behind the scenes with those signals, etc. Few of our stations get more than 80%, but they all seem to work about the same. The 80% requirement is probably CYA talk for Tivo tech, but it is a "20% gimmie" when they shouldn't have to warranty your end at all.)The remote range is limited, it does record shows you don't want (which you can turn off in settings - if it remembers), and it's not as smart as it's advertised. We use it strictly for over-the-air programs and our success is about 95% - sometimes it starts late, etc. Most of that 5%, however, may be our local stations moving things around to suit themselves, and not Tivo's error, really.We have an AppleTV and Roku in the house so we don't bother with the similar Tivo app offerings, but I have started to "boot up" some of the apps - but bailed when it was obviously taking longer than the Apple or Roku would to do the same thing.I wish I could be more positive about the Tivo; it is "likeable," but it's not all that exceptional.Especially not after having just recently seen cheaper and better technology doing the same OTA programming chores as well or better.

$review_text.: I am very disappointed with the performance of this lens


I expected better from Canon since I am a long-time Canon user and have many lenses by them

Images are soft to semi-sharp at all focal lengths

300mm is never sharp


When enlarged even 25% all images go very soft and become noisy and would be useless for printing

I get much better results with all my other Canon lenses


For the price of this lens I expected much better

My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images
Looking at the reviews others have written on Amazon, it may be that this particular lens has an inherent optics flaw


The IS works fine in both settings, but the images are still not crisp.

 Let me say
 I like this mouse


 I like the functionality (not that I ever used all the buttons)
 The ergonomic feel is perfect, it fits well in my hand (big hands)

 I initially bought one in April 2010


 After about a year, year and a half, the mouse would register every single left click as a double click
 Very annoying if you are trying to drag and drop, or relocate icons (opens file/program)
 Opens every email instead of just letting you see it in the view pane
 I called Logitech and they replaced it with no problems...Didn't cost a dime

 However, now mouse number two is starting to act up after about the same amount of time


 Frustrating to say the least
 I will be calling them today to replace it again


Despite this obvious defect, I would probably buy it again for the Amazon price $69ish


 Retail anywhere else, including Logitech is $99


 With the exception of the click problem over time, I would have rated this as a five star.

It is really very good-looking and feels nice in the hand.It is made of heavy 1/8 in. thick felt in a heather grey to protect from bumps with a very soft interior of dove grey sueded fabric prevent scratches. All of the stitching is precise--notice the H-shape of the stiching of the strap.The accents are a high-quality protein leather in a baseball-glove brown. The strip at the top has an antiqued bronze snap and the one at the bottom is in the perfect place for gripping when carrying the sleeve in the hand.There are two slit pockets on the back that are just the right size for smartphones, business cards, or writing instruments. An accessory pouch with a flap and an elastic enclosure is included; it measures 6 in. x 4 in. x 1 in.The "fashionable" model has outside dimensions of 9 in. x 14 1/2 in. and will comfortably hold notebook computers up to about 8 1/2 in. to 12 1/2 in. Do check the measurements and consider one of the other styles for larger notebooks, as they would protrude at the top corners of this particular case. The other models have a different style flap that would cover slightly deeper notebooks. The sleeve can also be used to hold standard letter-sized papers or pads.Inateck provided a sleeve for evaluation and review.

Using this and my Android phone I'm able to push Netflix, Pandora, Google Music and a variety of other apps to my TV.  Its an easy install, if you can get to your HDMI plug on your TV all you have to do is plug the Chromecast in and then plug the supplied power plug into the wall to power the Chromecast.  Its that easy.  The setup took 5 minutes using the Android Chromecast app on Google Play. The only thing that suprised me was the device is a bit bigger than I expected, but it comes with an extension in case it needs to hang freely behind your TV or device instead of plugged in directly.

It took nearly 2 hours to format in Windows to NTFS, but I've heard that's typical for Windows and it now runs fast and quiet (so far). Some older Seagate drives have known firmware issues, so Seagate's website allows you to enter the drive's serial number to confirm the firmware and get a firmware bios-flash update if needed. The drive I received was new enough not to need any upgrade. I've only given it 4 stars for reliability due to the fact that I've only used it for a month as of this post. There was no SATA cable or installation CD and the packaging was sparse, but I've ordered "bulk" drives from Amazon before so I knew what to expect and I'm not complaining about it.

$review_text.: These are really nice small speakers that provide a nice bass but for my needs not enough volume! I have my computer hooked up to my tv but I have a really loud air conditioner in my room and sometimes when watching youtube videos I can't hear them very well, I was hoping this would help but it doesn't provide loud enough volume. Otherwise they are great for small spaces, don't take up much room, have a nice sound and are easy to hook up, but if you need to really have loud sound these aren't the ones.

$review_text.: I bought this flash drive because there is very little clearance to access the usb3 ports on my T430. This dive is no thicker then a usb3 cable so it can be plugged in parallel to a usb cable. Almost no retractable flash drives can do this! I have had it a few weeks and it as fast as it is rated. If you value toughness over everything else, there are better and cheaper choices. However if you need a thin quality flash drive that looks professional this is a solid choice.

I literally have to extend my arm completely and aim directly at the receiver to have it work. But when doing so it works well.

$REVIEW.: The letters, etc


are quite large but the keys are the average size
 The keyboard is completely black

 All that lights up are the BOLD letters unlike some keyboards we've seen which have black letters and the face of the keyboard lights up.Having alot of lighting next to your computer is not necessary because the letters are easily seen.We had the computer off when keyboard was plugged in

 It booted perfectly, we did nothing else.Three choices exist for the color of the letters, red, purple (really lilac-but not too bright) or blue (turquoise)

 The brightness of the colors cannot be adjusted.-working great for the week we've had it.

Full display port is much better than mini because it actually locks into place.  My Radeon HD 7950 lost connection from time to time and I needed to wiggle the min-display port adapter I bought from Accell to bring the picture back.All in all this worked perfectly.

$REVIEW.: We had an older Philips docking speaker that we enjoyed but had issues with - the stand broke off after only a month.  It didn't hold a charge as well as we would have liked, and after a while the ipod started falling forward.I held off reviewing this for a while to make sure that none of the same problems occurring with this version.  The look of this portable speaker is far sleeker and much more attractive.  I love the look of the speaker, it's slimmer than our previous one.  The stand is far sturdier and has yet to break after several months of use.  Also the cover on the speaker has kept it cleaner than our other one.The sound is fantastic for such a small speaker and it works well with both our I-pods and I-phones - we don't have an I-pad to try it with but it appears that at least the smaller I-Pads would work fine.For the price and the size the sound and durability are all I could ask for.  This has been used to listen to music in the garage, back yard, shower and has been taken to work for listening to audiobooks.

$REVIEW.: We've had a Canon camera for decades, from SLR to G1 to A700 they have all been excellent products and every one has performed as advertised and never had a defect.  As technology advanced, each device had its own learning curve.  The A1300 generation went from buttons and dials to just buttons, so now instead of a glance and thumb to change modes, a dance through buttons and menus is needed.  It is harder to use then previous, but does take excellent pictures with good automation if you want it.  Confusing the shutter and power buttons is very easy.The Canon picture transfer program is also a step backward, it is not compatible to older cameras and doesn't work across network shares, so load it separately from older programs.  No major improvements from previous programs.The camera uses AA batteries, which is good because of availability far and wide.  No matter how good a rechargeable is, when its dead, its hours away from being usable again.  You can't judge battery usage by picture count, figure on 45 minutes to an hour of continuous use or 2 to 3 sets a day during ambitious site seeing.All in all, if you are looking for a good grab and snap pocket/purse camera, the A1300 is a good choice.

$review_text.: Got it for a HP dv6500t since it was getting too hot under the HDD bay. I think the GPU is located somewhere near there as well which causes the heat to get concentrated in that spot. There is a huge noticeable difference in the temperature, not to mention the speed and of course, the battery life has improved to a certain extent as well (around 15 to 20 minutes more). There is also the reduced noise to deal with now, especially during boot up.

$review_text.: It does what it's supposed to, but everything about it is just cheap.  The touchpad malfunctions in a variety of ways.  It almost always fails to recognize a tap as a click, often just fails to respond when you try to use it, and otherwise exhibits a wide variety of malfunctions that I would just describe as weird errors.  The keys feel cheap, too, and you have to keep a close eye on your computer screen to make sure that all the keys you press actually make it to the computer.It's frustrating to use, but I still reach for it sometimes as a smaller alternative to my full-size keyboard and mouse when I just want to queue up a TV show or movie on my home theater PC.It does seem to make very efficient use of its batteries; I've been using it daily for about 2 years now without replacing the batteries once.If I could go back and buy something different, I would.

$REVIEW.: Id have to go with the crowd on this one, pretty disappointed with this item.  While I wouldn't give it 1 star, (it did show up, description matches item, it is anti glare, and it didnt like catch on fire or blow up or anything), but it is deficient in several areas.  I really liked the Marware case, which is why I had high expectations for this item as well.  The applicator helped get most of the bubbles out from under the protector, but mine still lifts around the very edges. This leaves me the feeling I'll go through the 2 screens rather quickly as they'll lift and peel, allowing dirt and dust to comb between the screen and the protector. The cleaning cloth provided is probably insufficient to get the screen as clean as it should be before application.  Id recommend getting a good screen cleaner and wiping down with that first (if you have a lot of screens,I highly recommend the Bryson Screen Cleaner, 16 oz. Spray Bottle also sold on Amazon).  The anti-glare film on the screen protector is very pro-smudge.  Before I was done getting all the air pockets out, using a combination of the applicator and my finger tips, the entire thing was a swirly smudgy mess.  The occurrence of smudges continues on from here as evidenced with daily usage.  I found it was this pro-smudge effect of the anti-glare screen that made the text hard to read.  Live and learn I guess. I think others have recommended the clear version of this item.  Id definitely look at something else. Wish half star ratings were available, Id give it 2.5 stars.

$REVIEW.: I am inserting a copy of my review of theSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB Thunderbolt Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000400)as they were tested together. Minor changes due to change of venue ;-)Well, well, well! I previously got aSeagate Backup Plus 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STCA2000100, and aSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101), both of which I reviewed in Vine. At first I had to use them with FW800 and they were quick. I purchased aSonnet Allegro USB 3.0 PCIe Card (2-Ports, Macintosh/Windows) USB3M-Efor my Mac Pro (Early 2009) MB871LL/A, 2.66GHz Quad Core Xeon, and they are really fast! I kept procrastinating on buying theSeagate Backup Plus Desktop Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE129)to use them with for several reasons, 2 being the cost and the fact I only have Thunderbolt on my MacBook Pro (17-INCH, LATE 2011) and do not use it for storage purposes.Then along comes a Vine offer and I was able to acquire both this STAE129 AND theSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB Thunderbolt Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000400)!!!  WAHOOOOO!!!Well, today I busted open the boxes. I disconnected the USB 3.0 adapter from the first 3GB drive and connected it up to the STAE129. I took all up the my MacBook Pro, connected up the cables, and daisy-chained the STAE129 to the STCB3000400 using a Thunderbolt cable I had lying about (fortunately, AS A THUNDERBOLT CABLE IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THE STAE129!!! GRRRRR!. Had to initialize the drive connected to the STAE129... don't know why*, it worked on my Mac Pro with USB 3.0, but heck, initialization is FAST too.So, both drives show up on the desktop, I start up QuickBench and run the tests (results follow). I then ran a second test on the daisy-chained drive with it directly connect to the MacBook Pro - no appreciable difference so daisy-chaining is OK = 6TB of FAST drive space 8-0!

Whoever got the patent for this thing did it right


It sticks to slick granite at a 45 degree angle, and it clings to my truck dashboard like a cat to a tree

$REVIEW.: this is a nice folio! The Bluetooth pairing is easy and it the keys all work

The magnets that hold it down work well but I wish that it was built into both sides so you could simply flip it over and then convert to tablet mode without having the keyboard exposed in the back
It is a minor annoyance having to remove it and I have even tried to use velcro but the sticky side refused to stay stuck when you peel the keyboard off.

$review_text.: I purchased this adapter so I would have a secondary one for work.  I like to keep my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+ on my desk at work, with weather or a clock displayed continuously.  This tablet requires a 2.1 amp adapter, similar to an iPad.  (A standard USB adapter is only 1.0 amps.)  Additionally, I was looking for a low-cost adapter.This adapter works perfectly for this purpose.  There are two USB ports; one is unmarked, the other is marked "iPad Compatible".  This seems somewhat misleading; when I plug my tablet into the port marked "iPad Compatible" it doesn't provide enough charge.  It seems similar to my other "standard" 1.0 amp adapters.  When I plug the tablet into the unmarked port, it seems to charge fully.The packaging claims that this product provides a TOTAL of 2.1A.  However, if I plug my iPod Touch into the second port, both the tablet and the iPod still seems to be charging.  (I'll experiment with this more and provide an update if I discover anything additional.)The packaging also claims "short circuit protection" and "over temperature protection".  I can't verify these claims, but hopefully they are true.Of course, I can't guarantee it will provide enough power for your particular device, but it does provide enough for mine.  I expect it will power any 2.1 amp device sufficiently.In short, it's an inexpensive ($7) adapter that will provide enough power.  I gave 4 stars, because I only give a product 5 stars if it is exceptional in some way.Frank

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased this camera-- I wanted a small, cheap backup camera, and the price Amazon was offering it at was incredible. Once the camera arrived, I took it out for several test shots under different lighting conditions (indoors w/ flash, bright indoors w/o flash, outdoors closeup & distance). Uploaded the pics to my mac, took a good look, and returned it to Amazon within six hours of the first shot.Looking at the whole picture on the screen, the Fuji's image was noticeably "soft", and when zoomed in at all, they looked like watercolor paintings. Noise everywhere, even on shots where I dialed down the ISO. 4x6 printouts were barely acceptable, I'd never go larger. Overall image quality was what I'd expect in a camera from ~2000-2001, not a current generation camera. Compared with my other 5MP camera (an S2IS), these images were not useable. Still, this is a clever little camera that looks great & would be very easy to carry as long as you're not picky about noise in the image.

$REVIEW.: I am sorry to report my disappointment with this case. After researching and reading reviews for at LEAST 15 different iPad keyboard cases, I decided to purchase this one based on the features, appearance and especially the reviews. Finally confident with my purchase, awaited it's arrival then to put it to use.Plugged it in to my CPU to charge overnight. Next day charging light still yellow-ish orange. So I plugged it into the wall using an adapter. Still no green light. Instructions said it would work while charging so I went ahead and started the connection process paring with my iPad. Reset everything, Bluetooth off, etc.Followed instructions exactly. First few times no connection light came on at all. But, the caps light was on the entire time and charging lite still yellow-orange. Second attempt, same thing. Reread all instructions again. Followed troubleshooting notes exactly.  Reset all again. Finally got the blue connect light! Typed in the paring code, said connected but keyboard did not work.Okay, reset everything again. And AGAIN, after a couple more attempts, no connection. Each time a note appeared from my iPad something like "... No connection. Make sure keyboard is within 33 feet of iPad." etc.So I reread all the reviews here to see if I was missing something. Nope! One more attempt and I DID get a blue connection light! Typed in the paring code and thought "Finally!!". Everything ready to go. Tested with a new email, keyboard did NOT work, period. Checked settings, keyboard disconnected and would not connect again.I'm done. I really tried to make it work but after an hour of this, I'd had enough. And I am NOT new to this. Unfortunately, it's going back.

$review_text.: This is a great product, especially after what i have experienced with other router companies. The easy to read and do instructions on the router's manual are really helpful and very user friendly. It is all available in easy to follow format on CD. I had a Netgear router, which never really worked that trouble free like the Linksys 54 mbps. This Linksys router is very easy to install and is the best in the market in its category. It has got other features like one touch security, which makes your router secure and unsecure at touch of a button. Simply put, if you need a non-fancy reliable router with easy installation and trouble free service and good secured wireless connection, this is a right product for you. Try it and thank me later!

$review_text.: I needed this basically for an additional set of audio in and out ports

My PC's built in ports are being used for my headset, I needed to get a line in and line out for a second device, and this allows me to do that with a single USB line
I plugged it in and it was immediately detected and worked fine, but a few of the ports didn't show up until I installed the included driver
The only complaint is that the blue light on top (which blinks if you don't have the driver installed or stays on steady if the driver is installed) is really bright, to the extent that if I shut off the lights and my monitor, it's the brightest thing in the room, which was a minor annoyance when trying to sleep


I had to cover it with tape.As for some more specialized advice, the second device I'm using this for is an amateur radio
I have this connected to my TS-820S for use with soundcard modes, and it has a good 2dB improvement in signal reception signal-to-noise over the on-motherboard ports, and I get signal reports back that are slightly better, but it's very variable

You can buy better sound cards for this purpose, but let's be honest - this probably isn't going to be the weakest part in your system


Definitely the best value for your money for any purpose.By the way, this product is exactly the same asVantec USB External 7.1 Channel Audio Adapter (Black),Diamond External Xtreme Sound 7.1-Channel USB Audio Device,StarTech.com 7.1 USB Audio Adapter External Sound Card with SPDIF Digital Audio Sound Cards ICUSBAUDIO7D, andSabrent USB-SND8 8-Channel 3D USB 2.0 External 7.1 Surround Sound Box with Digital Output

I then connected the Sennheiser  RS 120 Headphones and everything worked as expected.  The BlueRigger cable provides the right amount of flex and the molded end connectors are not too big.  Just remember to remove the small plastic tip protectors prior to plugging in cable.  These can be easily be overlooked if you have never used Toslink cables.

$REVIEW.: You can go to your pro photographer friends and ask for a recommendation... they may tell you BW, Heliospan, or a number of well know companies that make filters and have impecable reputations. If you buy on reputation or recommendation I think you are cutting yourself short. It is hard for a human being (the human eye) to objectively asertain the performance of a filter such as a UV filter... after all... we can't see UV light. We can see the haze in backgroung outdoor shots however it is hard to quantify it.I read a lab test on a large number of el-cheap and very expensive (the full range) of UV filters that were analyzed using a Hatachi "State of the Art" spectrometer. This device is design to determine how much light of various wavelengts are being filtered and how much is being let through.  I was SHOCKED and dismayed by the number of high end filter that didn't even measure up to the UV light filtering capabilites of plain old glass (glass is a good UV filter by itself!).  They also tested how much the filter stops down your lens (reducing incoming light) and though this one didn't fare as well as a high end unit (that produced no UV filtering) it is still very very good.The Hoya multi coated filters beat out ALL other in the UV tests.  I bought the PRO1 filter because it is slightly lower profile and won't contribute to vignetting on my wide angle lens.  The ring is metal... aluminum I think. It is also blackened to prevent reflections. Hope this helps someone... Google, "Filter Review Hatachi Spectrometer" to find and read the study yourself.  Apparently some of these highly regarded companies are sitting on their laurels and not putting forth quality products anymore.  Leave your mind open to Science... not to hype, recommendation (people tend to recommend their own bad purchases), and reputation.  Thanks.

 These went in the back of a 1993 Toyota Tercel on the rear deck and sound really good
 The bass is tight and defined,  the highs are crystal clear while bouncing off the rear window
This was not a drop in installation because the rear deck needed to be pulled apart  so the speakers could be mounted down properly; it took several hours....

$review_text.: I own Sony EX-51's,EX-90's, Koss KSC 35's, Sony MDR-600's, AKG 240's....let's just say I owned and have owned a lot of headphones over the years
 So what is one more?  The problem over the years is all my headphones have fallen apart and been replaced since the birth of the Cassette Walkman

The UE appealed to me
 First have you ever tried to get replacement bud/pads for Sony products?  It is rape; you pay for ex


$10 for one silicone bud!!!  UE sells 10 @ $20
 Second, the cord always goes bad so you buy a new pair
 UE sells a replacement cord for $20 when it goes bad

 I figure in the long run I'll be saving money.I have been spoiled with bad sound for years


 When compare to my home stereo which is neutral as one can get UE's match up
 Sony's always where a bit artificial and bloated when it came to bass


 UE's are a natural bass but, if you are a bass head I'd recommend something else

 The clarity of mid-range freq

is better than anything I've heard in a while
 The high-end is crisp and detailed.You don't need noise canceling headphones with UE's I have always cranked up the volume to max or near that on any device I have ever owned because it was never loud enough; not so the UE's I have to turn the volume at least half on any device I listen to

 Otherwise you are goin' to blow your eardrums out.They are not a comfortable as Sony ear bud's but, they are not uncomfortable
 I can sleep with Sony phones not so with UE because the stick out and I am afraid of damaging them.The sound is a little getting use to for me because I haven't heard real sound out of a headphone for years
 Like I said before they are more like my home rig in sound

$review_text.: Celestron 15x70. I don't own them, but I've looked through them at a star party. The eye cups are hard plastic and not comfortable. The 18 mm eye relief is good for people with glasses but too much for me. If you hold them by the base of the barrels, you can hand hold them very steady. I could control the aim, and I nailed some deep sky objects I could barely see and easily miss in my 10x50. Andromeda looked much bigger. They are not a huge improvement over 10x50, but they definitely make it easier to see some objects. I read many people say they can see the rings of Saturn in these things.I'm buying the Nikon Aculon 16x50 for $106 because I want the smaller size for daytime use. I looked at the Pleiades through several scopes of different sizes, and I think the 10x50 gave the best view.

$review_text.: Fits the Nexus 10 perfectly.  Two positions for angle are great.  The hand strap is especially useful for walking around holding it, something I didn't think I'd be doing but turned out I've used that feature a dozen times.Only downside is that the little clip that keeps the cover closed doesn't grab the side of the Nexus 10 very well.  The cover has not fallen open, but it seems like it could.  My wife has an almost identically designed case by another manufacturer for her Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9, and that case not only has more robust feeling &#34;leather&#34; on the outside, the clip to close the cover fits snugly and grabs the edge of the tablet in a way this one does not.So, does the job fine, but could be improved.  Had I not had my wife's similar case to compare to I'd probably have give it 5 stars.  But since I know there are slightly better cases out there, it just gets 4.

$review_text.: I give this product a 4 out of 5 for it's awesome sound, comfortable fit, and isolating sound.  The only downfall is that every pair I have ever had will lose sound in the right ear.  I have had 3 pairs of these, each one of them the right ear went out.  My father has a pair of these, the right ear has decreased in volume and started to sound distorted.  If your looking for seasonal ear buds, these are perfect, but if you want something that lasts for a year or more, maybe the next product would be your best bet.Pros:  Great soundComfortable fitGreat sound isolationCons:  Right ear goes out after 5 months.

$review_text.: These are an amazing set of headphones. I'm not an audiophile by any means. My main source of music is my iPod. Anyways, I've had these Grados for 4 years and the build and sound quality is excellent. These headphones bring new life to your existing music collection. I'm pretty rough with my headphones, and these are the only pair of headphones that have lasted this long for me.In less than four years, I've broken:Sennheiser HD280 (which also had excellent sound quality) - and the foam started falling apart and the headband broke, but the headphones still produced fine sound,Sony MDR-blah-blah (lesser sound quality) - build quality really sucks the foam started peeling in about a month,4 different Skull-Candy earbuds (decent sound quality. better than the Sonys). I keep buying the skull-candy earbuds because they're more convenient for flights and travel. Unfortunately, they keep breaking. It's pretty annoying.Anyways, the only pair of headphones that have lasted this long are the Grado SR60. Plus, the Grado SR60 has the best sound quality along with the Sennheiser HD280.

$review_text.: If you do research on this TV on the Internet, you'll find that many reviews point to the LNT4665F as one of the best 46" HD LCD TVs out there. Its picture quality is one of the best with a 15000:1 "Dynamic" Contrast ratio. (Amazon and other sites rate it at 12000:1, but the actual Samsung website says 15000:1 .)  This means that you'll get very deep blacks that other TVs cannot produce as well. The resulting picture is clear, crisp, and simply stunning. The TV is also very bright for an LCD TV. I saw this in a showroom before I bought it and it was one of the brightest TVs on the floor along with the Sony XBR2's. The difference between the two of course is the price. The LNT4665F is about $500-$800 cheaper than the Sony. So why pay more for picture quality that you can get cheaper?The other thing you might find about this TV is that some consumers have had problems with the LNT4665F. The main issue is the signal-loss over the HDMI inputs. Essentailly, some users have experienced the TV going completely black after about 30-60min of operation. Turning it off and then on again fixes this problem, but the signal loss happens again about a hour later. I myself have experienced a similiar issue over the HDMI inputs, but it turned out to be a faulty Cable Box, and not the TV. (I replaced the Cable Box, and plugged into the HDMI and it works fine without any dropouts now.) However, I do believe that many people have had some problem with this TV, but I haven't experienced it myself. Like all things, I suppose there are a few lemons out there that come out of manufacturing. But thats why there are things such as warranties, and return policies for you to use should problems occur.Amazon's price for the TV was the lowest I found. Add the fact that I've always had good experiences with Amazon, and I was already decided on buying from them. They gave me free White-Glove delivery too. This is a service that they contract to a company called Eagle. Basically Amazon delivers the TV to Eagle's facilities. Then they call you to set-up a delivery appointment (Saturdays available in some areas!). When they come with the TV, they unbox it for you, and wait for you to test and examine the TV for any damage during shipping. If all is well you sign-off on it and your done. For me, I ordered the TV on a Tuesday. I got the call to deliver it on Friday. I set-up the appointment and got the TV on Saturday morning - not bad at all for an Internet transaction of this size!

$REVIEW.: They are fairly comfortable if you have small ears

The cups are smaller than some headphones


They aren't super plush.The sound is decent for the price


They don't compare to my more expensive headphones, but for the $20 I spent they aren't bad.The build quality seems very cheap

Lots of plastic rattle sounds, the headphones are manufactured cheaply (ear pads glued on, so not easily replaceable)
They don't feel like they'll last a while.The cable is long and is 1/8&#34;, which means it'll fit into your iphone, ipod, or laptop.Verdict: If you don't care about the cheap feeling, they are good


For the money, I feel like there are better options.Right now the Logitech UE4000 headphones are on a deep, deep sale
$30 compared to the original $100 price

They are discontinued, so don't expect them to last


The sound quality and build quality blows the AKG out of the water IMO


If you want to spend more, the UE6000 headphones are the best you can get for $100

They'll make $500 Beats headphones sound like a childs toy.

$REVIEW.: Whether you're looking for a way to quickly free up tapes and memory cards so you can take more pictures, want to archive old footage on VCR tapes, or master videos and photos quickly onto DVD, the VRDMC5 is a versatile Swiss Army knife that can take a wide variety of inputs and chuff out finalized DVDs rapidly.I recently became overwhelmed with all of the video and photos I had on my various cameras and I also didn't want to clog up my computer hard drive with everything that I've recorded recently.  If there is a lesson of the HD era, it's that high definition eats up storage space like nothing before it.  This great device, extremely usable without a computer, is just the answer to the video and photo archival/backup problems more and more of us are facing.Here's how the VRDMC5 breaks down:PROS:* Simple to set up and use, especially for a Sony product.  The menus aren't perfect but they can be figured out rapidly enough.* An excellent match for AVCHD format videos, an increasingly popular format for storing HD video on solid state (i.e. non-tape) devices, particularly Sony HD video cameras.  Made nice DVDs that were recognized as cameras in iMovie with no problem.* Fast, simple downloading of photos from memory cards of all the most common makes and types.  The VRDMC5 can handle photos as well, and though making slideshow DVDs can take a while, if you just want to download to disc, it's a very fast, simple process.* Solid feel and construction overall, though perhaps a little too bulky and not strong enough for frequent travel.  I will test this on my upcoming 20 day road trip and post an update.* One button operation for most purposes.  There's a big red button on the front of the device and when you connect your camera/media and insert a disc, the most common operation is invoked by the button and it's usually the right one.  Very iPod-esque for Sony and a smart feature that really works.* Works with and records on 8cm blank DVD-Rs and DVD-RWs with no trouble (just don't insert them into your MacBook, which *doesn't* support them; I found out the hard way.)- Transcribed video from S-Video or regular RCA cable nicely and with decent quality.  I felt the output onto DVD, even in fine mode, is just a little too blocky looking and pixelated when viewed for my taste, but it does work; you can just connect and record any video signal with this device and burn directly onto DVD, live.  This good for capturing all sorts of pre-recorded or live events onto DVD media without the use of a computer.- You can use DVD-RW or DVD+RW for recording most content (the latter recordable disc format is generally much better, though a tiny bit more expensive) so you can re-use DVDs over and over again (I archive most of my videos and photos online to flickr.com, vimeo.com, and Amazon's S3 service using Jungle Disk, then reuse the recordable DVD media with this device.)- Works great on the Mac and iMovie except when making regular video DVDs.  In other words, AVCHD recorded discs came across just fine with no problem and no extra software of any kind was needed, but movie DVDs created by the VRDMC5 won't import without significant gyrations.  This is an iMovie limitation though, NOT the device.CONS:- Does NOT work digitally with Sony's MicroMV cameras I'm sad to report.  It reports the device as unknown when you connect the USB cable. MicroMV tape formats require an S-Video translation that takes as long as it takes to play the movie back and there is considerable loss of video quality.  You can take the digital transfer route but then this device is not very useful any more since you have to do everything on your computer.- Does NOT work via USB with any hard drive camcorder I tried (though I don't have a Sony HDD camcorder).  This is not a huge deal but was something I'd would expect to work given how standard the USB interfaces tend to be on HDD camcorders.  I tried many times but the VRDMC5 always reported it as an unknown USB device.- Can't use double-layer discs for photo archival.  Not critical but it's a weird omission.  Some people have reported that this actually works but just takes a long time.  I haven't tried it but the manual says it doesn't work.- Too bulky.  It feels like there is lots of empty space in the unit's case and it could have been made smaller.  This device is perfect for taking on the road when you're not near your home computer and mass storage devices, but it's going to be a stretch to take with you since the device and power supply take up a great deal of room.  There's also no carrying case I can find for this.- Screen is tiny (though very clear) and can't be angled.  Some people have reported this a problem and I've just ended up holding the unit in my lap so I can see better.  Not a huge deal but it would have been nice to have a hinge on the LCD.

 Was very hard to line up and was so sticky if a pet hair got on it, you could not get it off

 I recommend you purchase one of the new style protectors where the adhesive is only on the edges
 Those work very well - no bubbles and no sticky issues

 This kind of screen protector will become obsolete soon as the other kind becomes better known & a bit less expensive
I would never buy this again.

$review_text.: I bought two of these Gigabyte 7950s to run in a Bitcoin/Litecoin mining rig because the reviews all showed it came out-of-the-box with a 1GHz stock clock, so I wouldn't have to mess with things to get decent performance.I was running both cards in an open-air (frame) case because they get very hot under 100% load.  Temps were never more than 78C on either card in this configuration.One day, I came home from work and the computer was powered off.  I checked things out only to notice that one of the 7950s had a nice black, burned area on the backside of the PCB where something had fried.  I got on Amazon to do an RMA and was fortunate that I still had 12 minutes left in the return period, so back it went.I restarted the computer with the remaining single 7950 and it has been running for a few weeks just fine.  This last Tuesday, I just happened to be watching TV, which is in the same room as the computer, and I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye.  I saw the LEDs power off, then the computer tried to power back on, and another flash/visible flame lept out of the 7950, and everything powered-down as I got that pungent stench of burning electronic components filling my house.I happened to be lucky to notice this and I yanked the cord from the wall before anything got worse.  Fortunately, I have a good power supply (Corsair GS700) that has over-current protection and drops into safe-mode when this kind of thing happens, or else who knows if I would have come home to nice little fire that day when the first card fried while I was at work.I'll be RMAing this second 7950 because I can no longer return it to Amazon.  However, after having TWO of these fail in EXACTLY the same way, I can say that I have pretty much zero faith that I'll run the replacement in my computer and will probably just ebay it or try to sell it to someone else.  Worrying about fires is not worth it.I've uploaded photos showing the burned PCB if you'd like to see.

$review_text.: If you're looking for a router to browse the internet and do some light video streaming, this will work just fine.  However, I have two teenage boys who like to play video games.  We experienced alot of packet loss, lag and sometimes even complete signal loss for a minute or two.  This only happened when someone was using up a bunch of bandwidth, or if someone was playing an online game like Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends.  I had to abandon this router, because it didn't work well for us.  It just caused alot of frustration.

$review_text.: My reason for buying this particular camera was the "anti-shake" image stabilization. Too many of my picture are, eh, taken during an earthquake, as the old joke goes. Well, the very first time that I gave this camera a road test, I found myself at the coast, wanting to take pictures with full zoom, while strong sea winds almost blew me off my feet. "Captain, permission to engage image stabilization?" "Make it so, number one!".And miraculously, none of my pictures were shaken or stirred. I love this thing.Another big plus is the big LCD on the back. It's big, it's gorgeous, and it makes you excited about your pictures while you're taking them. There is something psychological going on there, but the fact is that the LCD makes you fall in love with the camera and your own picture taking capability, even before you have seen the result.I'm giving this thing 4 stars instead of 5 because of two niggles. One: turning off the flash is confusing. Bizarrely, it seems you can not change flash settings when the anti-shake is engaged. Two: the lens is placed to the edge of the camera body, and I regularly find a finger of my left hand dangling in front of it. As a result I need to hold it in a somewhat unnaturally feeling way.But on the whole I'm very happy with this camera. And small and black it looks very sexy.

The red plastic knurled knob on top might break at some point in the future, as it seems fragile, but so far so good.

$REVIEW.: I'm pretty happy with these headphones, I received a reviewer pair intending to use them as my work headphones, and hope to make use of the sound canceling capabilities.  My previous head phones areSennheiser  PXC 310 BT Compact Noise-Canceling Travel Headphones with Bluetooth Technology (Black)so that is what I am comparing them to.Sound---I am very happy with the clarity of the sound from these headphones.  The music is crisp and has decent highs and lows.  The one thing I am a little disappointed with is there seems to be a lot of distortion when turned to just a moderately high volume.  Which probably works well with my use at work, but I can't truly crank these headphones without  getting too much distortion.  Of course this is probably good for my hearing, but to continue the comparison to the Sennheisers, these have less capability at higher volumes.When  listening to these at lower volume though, they are very nice.  I'm not a huge audiophile, but I can appreciate the sound quality these deliver.Sound canceling appears to work fairly well.  I can at least attest to the fact that I missed phone calls while listening to these, I am interested to see how the will work to cut airplane noise.Design ---I'm impressed with the way these headphones have been designed to fold for storage and transport.  They are not as compact as my Sennheisers, but they do fold into a decent size and the nice leatherette case holds them well, with space to spare for extra accessories.  The ear pieces swivel well to form to you head, the cable connects firmly and securely, and the battery compartment is well designed.Also, I am impressed that they thought to add an adapter for an airline headphone jack.  I am looking forward to having these to listen to on my next air trip.Comfort---The ear pieces are nicely padded that make a nice comfortable fit.  I have historically only used ear buds so at times my ears seem to get warm due to the coverage of the ear pieces.  The bar is padded but noticeable on your head, again for those used to earbuds this takes an adjustment.Summary---All in all these are nice headphones.  I prefer my Sennheisers which do deliver a little better sound on the corded connection (less sound quality over Bluetooth.)  However, I am happy with these, but not enough to justify the price savings over the Sennheisers.

The mounting style of this is quite different than the bullet camera's, but should present no problems at all by looking at the hardware. These seem to be intended for mounting under a soffit or on a ceiling primarily, where a bullet style is more flexible in where it can be mounted, in my opinion. Tamper proof? That's almost funny. No camera is whip cream proof, lol

$REVIEW.: I have owned several cd players over the past 25 years(Sony ES carousel,Pioneer,Technics,Kenwood,Emerson, Fisher,even a JVC DVD player).With my Sony, certain instruments and background vocals,the air produced by the instruments,the breath the vocalist would take,crisp plucking of guitar strings were lost,blended,hidden,fuzzed over.Musical and rhythmic hand claps were non distinct; Now, I can tell if there are two or three or more background singers/peformers clapping their hands

The Technics was harsh sounding
The Fisher, overtly bright sounding


The Kenwood,edgy or grainy in sonic characteristic.The Pioneer was the only one that barely impressed me, but NO wow factor as with the Onkyo.The Pioneer pales in comparison to the Onkyo
None of them ever came close to the sonic performance or build quality of the Onkyo C-7030, which I have lived with for the past month...and I must say, life has not only been good,it's been great! It is the first cd player in which I have listened to cd after cd for as long as three to four hours of non-stop, digital audio bliss
Why? I am hearing detail like I have never heard before


I had never purchased a cd player that was near in performance or on target as an audiophile grade component

I also realize that the word "audiophile" gets tossed around a lot when describing cd players or any hi-fi components that do not warrant the title or the dubious honor and distinction of being labeled as such due to less than stellar or just poor audio sound,build quality and reliability

Audio performance, build quality, and visual aesthetics of the C-7030 do warrant the audiophile label
I'll explain why.I have read other reviews with the majority giving it high praise, and a few dissatisfied reviews or "meh" comments about the C-7030


The sound quality to MY ears is impeccable(I've only been utilizing the provided RCA cables and not the optical or coax digital options on the back chassis panel)


Again, remember, this is coming from a guy previously never owning a cd player remotely near or rivaling the quality of this Onkyo, but I do KNOW quality when I hear it(vinyl record aficionado for the past several decades,also,here)
For the first few days, out of the box, I noticed how balanced the high frequencies sounded; They are not bright,etched,shrill,artificial,harsh or exaggerated

Certainly NOT rolled off,dull,warm,or "smeared"


Crystalline is how I can best describe the experience.Piano keys, the tinkling and tickling of the ivories ring pure sweetness

Cymbals sound REAL.Trumpets sound true(I listen to a lot of Latin and jazz, some classical,swing,big band)


Heavy electronic,synth laden and New Age music sounds fantastic without the Onkyo adding any digital coldness or harshness that is often the case with lesser players.Any genre of rock and R&B; sounds remarkable without distortion and while maintaining the clarity of each instrument's distinct sound(electric guitar,fuzz guitar,synthesizer,drums) 
Those genres sound lively and organic.The highs just FLOW.It is an overall happy medium with the highs
Absolutely no mind or ear fatigue as experienced with my previous cd players(made me think that THAT was THE norm for digital audio)
Certain audio component manufacturers roll off the highs and call that a "warm analog presentation"

It's not

Dull is dull
Others "enhance" the highs and while it may add that wow factor at first, fatigue on the ears and brain begins to set in.The mids are also pleasing to these ears
No upward tipping of the mids for that forcefully pronounced, sonic characteristic that translates to harshness(that can also cause ear fatigue).Female vocals sound very natural, almost live (you are there or they are there with you in the room!)
Male vocals could be a tad more convincing, but are still in the very acceptable audio range characteristic for said type of vocals(male vocals are not recessed, yet, could use just a smidge more "oomph").Very noticeable,precise,clean articulation of lyrics and enunciation of words have also amazed me like never before.Now,I have read a couple of other Amazon reviews where the bass was described as unimpressive

Let me tell you, the bass IMPRESSED me


It's clean and taut without being overly tight

The deep bass is there when called upon or needed

There is no loose, bloated, or boxy low end frequencies
Thin or anemic does NOT come to mind

Clean and correct come to mind
As far as sounding like a warm analog component akin to a turntable or vinyl record, first off, a cd will always sound like a cd and a record a record


If I wanted a cd player that sounded exactly like my turntable, then I would just stick with my turntable and vice versa or record my entire vinyl collection to the CD-R format(even then, I can still tell that it's a cd recording of a record and does not convince me that it sounds 100% like the vinyl source it was recorded from)


However, if you are talking about the easy-on-the ears analog sound characteristic, yes, the C-7030 is absolutely close(there is a thousands of dollars audiophile cd player that has been described as sounding like the master tape, so it can be done and done right with digital audio)! To me, music is "audio liquid" coming from the Onkyo C-7030 which translates to soothing or easy on the ears
Stereo imaging is the best I have heard (compared to my lower end cd players)
Excellent and distinct separation of the left and right channels and VERY solid central imaging; Instruments,vocals,effects are where they are supposed to be
No smearing or leaking or crosstalking artifacts;There should be none


There is also depth with regards where instruments are placed on the sound stage
Even without the lights turned out and me sitting dead center or in the sweet spot, it is evident that this player has an exceptional stereo sound stage and proper imaging! Much,much blacker backgrounds between tracks and in between solo instrumental breaks or pauses


Now, if you DO turn out the lights, close your eyes, no distractions and just the music, it becomes even more apparent why the Onkyo is such a worthy, budget priced, audiophile component.The build quality and aesthetics are exceptional for a cd player in this price range (almost weighs 12 lbs.).The centralized placement of the cd tray is aptly located without mistaking this for a low end generic cd player or low budget dvd player.The controls on the faceplate are well laid out, but could be a little bit bigger with much sharper white screen print above them.The disc tray drawer could open and close more smoothly for near silent operation.The display dimming feature is quite welcomed
The remote's controls could be larger, but it(remote) makes a cool Bang & Olufsen(as one fellow Amazon reviewer already noted) knock off statement without looking tacky or cheap.It's very Euro looking
The total design with brushed aluminum face plate is positively understated(minimalist,clean,sleek,modern) without bordering on dull or the opposite of clutter or busy; This player means business with class
The black C-7030 is the formal dinner tux version, while the silver overseas and European model is the sleek business suit version


Both are ultra-cool looking.There are much more higher end quality cd players with exotic material grade internal components(audiophile circuitry, power supplies, DAC's, transports,clocks,etc.) with an audio performance to die for

We're also talking in the several hundreds and thousands of dollars audio fidelity realm


From what I understand from others who have owned or continue to own such elite or upper echelon cd equipment, is that between the Onkyo C-7030 and said players, the differences in sound quality may be a subtle increment to not-so-subtle to "The C-7030 just cannot compete..." level

Yet, for those of us on a budget or that have not hit the winning lottery jackpot, the Onkyo C-7030 gives a modestly,yet,impressive taste into that audiophile realm.

I find it slim and easy to place the Kindle into so that it is locked in place by the tabs that are on the outside edges.  All contact between the case and the device is via a soft felt - like material.  The case folds such that you can view the Fire from tow different angles - this comes in handy on your lap or if you are on the couch watching a movie.  You have easy access to the power button and charging port.Overall nice simple device that looks well built so far - four stars for lack of colors when I got mine.Full disclosure:I should add I got this Dec 9th price 4.99Recently they offered a rebate for 5.00 if you write a review of the product - I normally don't have time to write reviews - but this product is very good so I don't feel conflicted by the payment.

Filter "wallets" allow the transfer of their materials such as mesh or plastic onto the expensive coatings of your expensive filters.  This pouch has individual padded pockets like those found in a quality camera bag.  Filter glass never touches anything damaging.Build quality of this pouch is great...it will last for many years. It is constructed of sturdy cordura with a secure velcro strap on front.  The rear has velcro mounting straps for many popular camera bag/case systems as well as your belt.

$review_text.: I recently purchased a Roku (2XS) at a local big box store for our bedroom, as we had a Wii connected to our living room TV
 After seeing how easy it was to use, I decided to move it to the living room, which left us with nothing in our bedroom, so I decided to purchase this one to use there.Hookup is very easy & quick


 Navigation is much easier on a Roku than a Wii!!!  The Roku's are great for Netflix, Crackle, etc..
However, I've found that a lot of the other channels do not stream as well

 There is sometimes a lot of buffering on these channels, where as Netflix (& other movie channels) stream flawlessly, so I can only assume it is the way the channels stream & not the internet connection, nor the Roku.Some of the other channels are nice, but some are just useless (hence the 4 star rating)!!!  If you are wanting something to stream Netflix, Crackle, Pandora or some of the other bigger named services, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  However, don't get caught up in the dream that this will replace existing cable/satellite services..

It won't.The only thing I wish the company would change is the fact that the Roku's don't power off
 Other than that, it's a great product!

$review_summary.: Great for movies!

$review_text.: PROS:- The trim looks OK. (That's all that matters, right?)CONS:- Very poorly written, hard to see/read manual.- Screws are too long and scratch the bottom of the stereo unit (albeit at non-visible area)Tried to use it for Honda Odyssey 2002, replacing factory radio with Pioneer FH-X700BT.The manual is poorly written. Fonts are tiny and diagrams are tiny. I ended up cutting wrong tabs, making it impossible to use the side (ISO?) panels to screw the unit to the car frame. When I realized this, I ordered the same one from Amazon, grudgingly. Fortunately, 5 minute later, I tried re-using the side bracket from the old factory radio and it did fit, although with some difficulty. I immediately cancel the order.All in all, I ended up using only the front trim. Also I used the rear-bottom bracket that held the front trim in place (I may not even need that one). But the tiny screws that join the two was too long and scratched the audio unit, albeit at an invisible area.It looked good once all the work was done.What's the lesson? Look very carefully the shape of the original factory radio's bracket and cut out only those tabs that are needed. Don't rely on the manual since you likely will be more confused. "Use the force".Hence, -1.5 star from the screws. -2.5 stars from the confusing, hard to read manual.

$review_text.: My dissatisfaction with the Canon SD880IS all stem from really missing my old Fujifilm F30.  That good old camera has the best lens/CCD of any point-n-shoot that I've ever seen.  Even ISO1600 photos were usable.  Everything was low noise.  But (probably because it's Made in Ch---) the two F30's that I've owned all crashed way before reaching 2 full years of use.  Yes, I had liked the camera so much that after the first one died I bought another one to replace it.Yes, the problem with the SD880 is NOISE NOISE NOISE.  Even at very low ISO I can see the noise everywhere on the picture.  I tried going for lower pixel count but they are still very visible.  If you want to buy this camera, make sure that you've taken a few photos and zoom them out in playback mode.  It's only after feeding a photo through Noise Ninja that I finally breathed a sigh of relief.Noise problem aside, the SD880 is packed with so many neat features.  I've set the manual white balance to be trigged by the printer button. All I have to do is to point the camera at the white ceiling, press the printer button, and the camera is white-balanced exactly for that specific lighting.Face detection works great, and I really like the TV - self-timer - Face detection combo:  I hook the camera to the TV, put the self-timer on Face detection mode, press the shutter, and nonchalantly walk to the spot of my choice before turning to face the camera.  The camera reads my face and multiple shots of me are made.This camera takes BEAUTIFUL indoor photos -- with a flash, that is.  (The Fuji F30 had been able to take all sorts of great indoor photos without flash.)  The Canon engineers have done a great job with post-processing to get such nice even lighting on indoor photos, especially with such a tiny flash.I take photos with i-Contrast off.  In the playback mode, I can apply the i-Contrast as I choose.  And speaking of i-Contrast, I find that the SD880 tries too hard to second guess what photos I want, and the photos tend to turn out a bit flat.  The photos all improve tremendously when I use Picasa or Photoshop to deepen the shadows.  This is especially true with indoor photos.The video mode is not so useful.  There is no optical zoom with video.  The camera fakes a video zoom by doing a digital zoom.  Of course, if the video is already only 640x480, doing a digital zoom will get you horrendous resolution.  So just pretend that there is no video zoom.  The microphone on the camera is bad.The handling of the camera is very good, and it is a beautiful looking gem.  And I hope that its being "Made in Japan" will at least buy me more years than my two terrific but unfaithful Fuji F30's.  Now if Canon were to come up with a 28mm F2.8 camera that had the same CCD-sensor philosophy and the manual controls as the F30 (fewer Megapixels for superb noise control), I would really PAY for that camera, bad economy or no.[Correction to my original review]I gave up on this camera.  I had written that indoor photography with flash was very nice.  I WAS WRONG.  The flash is simply too weak.  If the subject is perfectly still, yes, indoor shots with flash is lovely.  But last week I photographed some kids at a Thanksgiving dinner party.  They weren't even moving that much, but the flash could not freeze their motion.  In a normally lit room, with the camera set at hi-ISO (ISO 250) the shutter speed was 1/10 sec with flash.  Subject blur occurred.  I have never encountered such problem with any of the myriads of point-n-shoot that I've owned in the last 25 years.The camera is truly beautiful to behold.  But at the end of the day, it's decent photos that I want.  The lens is too small, pixel density on the CCD is too high, and the flash too weak.  No fancy bells and whistles on the electronics can overcome these physical limitations.

$REVIEW.: I got an ipod nano 3rd gen. as a gift a few weeks ago, and was wanting to find a good clock radio/dock at a good price.  Well, this IS a good value for the price, if you don't have the problems I had (&still; have) with it. First though, It's got great sound -- I've heard more expensive speaker systems that don't deliver nearly the sound quality of this one.  I like the little adjustable back brace for the ipod, I don't have to worry with getting it into the dock right.  It seems to charge the ipod fairly rapidly, although I do leave it on the dock overnight anyway.  I love the remote.  Even though I'm not sitting that far away from it when using it, it's still nice to be able to point and click.  The remote gives you full access to all the ipod functions, and is easy to figure out how to use (even for someone like me who isn't very electronics friendly.The big downside -- this thing is very particular about the order you do things to set the alarm.  I've had this thing for 2 or 3 weeks and I still set another clock as a back up, 'cause half the time the alarm doesn't go off on this thing.  The ipod has to be on the dock before you set the alarm, and you have to go through steps in a particular order or the alarm won't go off at all.Value for the price, ignoring the alarm problems, I'd give it an A.  Sound quality I'd give it an A+, as this unit really delivers.  But sony really needs to re-think how you set the alarm and make that a little more workable for those of us that aren't electronics genuises!

Blu-ray movies and HD satellite programming (esp sports) look awesome, and the size of the TV is just right for a home theater.  Standard def doesn't look very good on it because the picture is so big but you really aren't buying this TV to watch standard def are you?  I run everything through a receiver except a Wii and the speakers in the TV work fine for that.  I paid about $1350 shipped back in May and that continues to be a bargain in my mind.

Takes very nice video, still shots are so so but we have a digital camera for that.  Has nice feature set and does what it is supposed to do.  Easy to copy from hard drive to dvd.  Pretty much plug it in and it does its thing.  Burned disc faster than I thought.  I would highly recommend for the novice user.  Included battery does not allow for long record times at all.  You will definitely need to purchase a larger battery.  I just bit the bullet and bought the biggest battery Amazon carries for it.  Costing me another 100 bucks but as one reviewer said.

Right now there is an (OS) ROM update, and a firmware update.  The firmware update is the one that fixes this problem, but if you are planning to load the OS/ROM update as well, load that one first, then load the Firmware update.  You should always back up all your data before applying an update.I also had a similar problem when I didn't have the battery cover on and latched just right, but that's OK now too, as long as I don't drop the thing on the ground.

$REVIEW.: I purchassed two of these in the last month. Both worked great for the first few days, but then began to overheat and crash with even light bandwidth useage. Now one is completely dead, and the other is totally unreliable. Needless to say, they will soon be on their way back to Amazon!Do your homework and AVOID this product. I've had great luck with Linksys products, but this one is certainly a DUD! As hundreds of reviews and discussion boards from around the web will attest, the AE2500 is prone to overheating and has an an alarmingly high failure rate. If you get one of the very few that perform as expected, consider yourself lucky. If you do buy this, be prepared to deal with a steady stream of disconnects, followed by increasingly frequent device 'crashes', and then a complete early death of the adapter. Take a look at the discussion boards at Cisco/Linksys, and you'll see an endless string of "Oh, it must be your computer..." brush-offs and never-ending "try this" "try that" tactics to avoid ANY hint of a KNOWN issue with the device.

$review_text.: I received this product for Father's Day and wasted hours trying to get it to work
 I followed the directions and attached it to a late-model Samsung LED TV


 The AV connection worked, but the HDMI connection did not


 I confirmed the HDMI cable was good and that the TV HDMI port worked


 I then tried connecting the unit to another HDTV

The HDMI display did not work on either HDTV
 I called Roku support
 The tech walked me through turning the unit and TV on and off, hot swapping cables, and registering the unit so he could try a fix from his end

 In this process, I had to enter my wi-fi password (a long one) twice using the unit's clunky alpha numeric interface

 At one point, the tech told me that because the AV connection worked and the HDMI did not, it was my TV's firmware not recognizing the Roku unit

 I explained that I'd also tried another HDTV (an LG brand) and had the same issue


 Finally, after consulting with a supervising tech and having me go through the entire testing scenario again and re-booting the unit, no improvement
 He let me know that I could return the unit through Amazon


The tech was as helpful as he could be, given the steps he was required to put me through
 I don't fault the tech
The final capper was that I bought the unit to work with Amazon Prime, and when I tried (using the AV connection) to access Amazon Prime, the Roku could not make the connection and told me to try again later or contact Amazon


Given this experience, I returned the unit for a refund rather than try a replacement
I'll just buy a blu-ray player that's compatible with Amazon Prime
I didn't do this in the first place because I already have a nice Blu-ray player that does not work with Amazon Prime.

$review_text.: All of the items listed were purchased from Amazon. I purchased this case along with the Max5G case from Thermaltake. I use a Sabertooth Z77  motherboard which has the latest USB 3.0. For testing, I used a Seagate 1TB Sata3 (6GB) Constellation ES3, and a Seagate ES 750GB SATA2 drive. Using the SATA2 drive, both cases show with the CrystalDiskMark using USB3 to have 81MB/s read and 78MB/s write with 1GB blocks. At 512K, half that speed. On USB2, the readings were 35MB/s and 30MB/s. The big difference came when using the SATA3 drive on USB3. The MAX5G case provided 187MB/s read and 185MB/S write, while this case was 118MB/s read and 121MB/s write. All tests were repeated. Comparing the two cases, the Startech does have the aluminum sides, with mostly plastic for the 5G. Other than that, the Max5g is the better of the two at a higher price. FYI, the 5GB/s quoted in literature for cases in general only applies to the maximum speed of the USB 3.0 interface, NOT the speed of the controller of the enclosure. Depending on the chipset, speed and compatibility varies considerably. Both of the cases mentioned use the most compatible chipset, but not the same model.

$review_text.: PROS:Works really well on iPhones, iPods, and probably iPads and other oleophobic screensGood for a light cleaning for other devicesEasy to useMade in USACONS:Not so good for non-oleophobic screensThe iEraser is basically a slightly fuzzy microfiber clot, sewn around a soft block and attached to a flat plastic handle.  It looks like a very flat, chalkboard eraser, but a far more stylin'.  It will work with an iPhone or iPod touch, but--given its 4" x 2 3/4" size--is more suited for devices with 10" screens and larger, although it worked respectably well with a 7" tablet.  The surrounding block is easy to grip and easy to manipulate across an appropriate sized screen.The iEraser was excellent in removing smudges, dust, fingerprints, and pretty much all other debris from my iPhone screen and my iPod.  My guess is that it will work well on any oleophobic, glass surface.  The problem is that it did not work so well on my iMac screen, a laptop, or my flat screen TV.  Sure, it will remove dust and light smudges on these surfaces, but will not do it with same ease as it does on screens that are designed to repel foreign matter.  With the regular glass screens, you have to apply a little more pressure and accept the fact that not all smudges will relent at the sight of the iEraser.So for conventional glass, you should probably start with a traditional cleaning.  You can then use the iEraser for maintenance, as it will work on just about any screen for dust removal, so once you give your screen a traditional cleaning, it will be fine for upkeep.There is really no secret here: the iEraser cleans using a microfiber cloth.  You can get exactly the same effect by using the microfiber cloth you use to clean your glasses and applying it to your iDevice or TV.  I do have to hand it to iEraser people, though. Slapping the microfiber cloth onto a foam square and attaching a plastic block does make the process easier (and far more fun to do if like this kind of thing).  And it's also nice to find something that is actually manufactured in the USA.  Still, you may very well have all the equipment to do a screen cleaning, iEraser style, without buying the device in the first place.Warning: To avoid scratching your screen,you have to make sure that the screen is clear of any abrasive particles before using the iEraser.  If you move the abrasive particles around with the iEraser (or any microfiber cloth) you may well scratch your screen.CONCLUSION: The iEraser works just fine for touch-screen iDevices and similar devices with oleophobic screens.  Not so hot with conventional glass, but good for removing dust and light smudges.

$REVIEW.: I replaced an old NUVI 265W with this unit. I absolutely refused to pay the ridiculous price Garmin wanted to update the map data on my old device.This GPS is definitely much better than the old. It SHOULD be for the $299 price tag I paid (Now $199... nice). However, it is still not painless to use.The traffic information is virtually useless. The coverage is pathetic and the ads that make it "free" are terribly annoying.The ECO Route is nothing remarkable. Basically, as long as you don't speed and avoid roads that are stop-and-go, you are going to do fine.The large screen is nice and clear. But, the touch screen functionality is fair at best compared to other modern devices. If you use an iPhone, iPad, etc. it is painful to use by comparison (slow and lacking sensitivity).The menu structure is too complex and takes a LOT of navigation to get to the more refined search options and settings. The fact that you cannot return to the map at any point with one selection is unforgivable.Finally, as with every other NUVI I have used, searching for Points of Interest by NAME is absolutely awful. Seriously, it takes FOREVER. If I type in the name of a State Park or Recreation Area, it should come up with little or no delay. Unfortunately, that is not the case. So, it is best to always look up actual addresses online before entering locations into the GPS.I still think Garmin makes the best GPS units on the market. I just don't feel that they have kept pace with the improvements in user interface technology for mobile electronics.I'm also sour about paying $100 more for the unit less than 6 months ago.

$review_text.: One thing I always do before buying a product is check out all the NEGATIVE reviews vs. the POSITIVE reviews. I have owned Viewsonic is the past and I still have both of them!!!. This VX2753MH-LED HD monitor is just amazing for the price. If you buy a new DELL computer and your video card has a mini HDMI port, DELL provides an adapter. This monitor comes with a HDMI and VGA cable so you can use it out of the box. I you want to use DVI you will have to purchase a HDMI - DVI cable. There are enough settings on this monitor to make your viewing experience simply amazing. My monitor does not have any dead pixels. I love this thing....it's HUGE!!!!

 Cable is very light weight, but charges ok when only charging when not in use


 It does not do a good job of keeping charge up while in use with game graphics and occasionally shows and x on the charge icon, showing not charging properly

Still for a long cable to reach a bedside table at night it does a good job.

I purchased this model because of it's use of AA batteries

 Some of us photography enthusiasts still like replaceable batteries instead of the internal rechargeable ones
Photo quality is excellent

Its "smart" processor is one of a kind


Pop up flash also gives more direct control over the flash unit


 The only drawback for me is the lack of a wider angle lens for close up group shots.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this for Hubby as he works in Manhattan and had to lug his laptop back and forth to work every day in a messenger bag.  This is a nice heavy duty backpack and has a padded enclosure to protect the laptop. The laptop sits towards the back of the backpack right along your back so you can feel comfortable in knowing it will still be there (even while walking around shady areas of the city). It holds all of his wires/cds/books without any problems and it has proven through a hurricane and a blizzard to be 100% waterproof. Even hurricane sandy couldn't take this bag down.  I definitely got my monies worth on this one.

$review_text.: I purchased this battery for long trips where plugging into the wall was not convenient.  For business trips, I carry both a Blackberry and an iphone, both of which are notorious battery consumers.  By midday, I would usually need to charge them.  I used to carry 2 kensington batteries and would connect each device to a battery and stow them in my brief case while they charged.  That worked ok, but at the end of the day I would have to charge each one separately or carry multiple cables.  Now I don't have to do that.  I can charge both phones from one battery and at the end of the day, just charge the one battery.  Less cables and sometimes I can charge each device twice before running out of juice.The only con was the power button.  When placing it in a bag or brief case, the button can accidentally be pressed, thereby shutting off the battery.  It would be nice to have a recessed sliding switch on the side instead.The pro's are 1) great battery life/capacity  2) Compact size  3) Dual ports to charge 2 devices at the same time 4) Sleak appearance  5) and you can even use it to charge 2 devices at the same time while plugged into the wall outlet.I definitely recommend this device for the gadget owner who carries multiple devices and needs a charge while away.  I also recommend it for families on long car rides when two kids in the back seat both have devices to charge.  You can recharge both a handheld game device at the same time as an mp3 player, no more fighting for the power plug.

$REVIEW.: I've had this camera since 2002 and still love it. I found it to be extremely user friendly and it takes great pics. This is the fourth digital camera I have owned and the best so far. If you purchase the dock you can do a one touch transfer which saves the battery life. It also recharges the battery. If you purchase a lithium battery it lasts a really long time.The only problem I've had is the outdoor "scenic" night pictures could be a bit clearer. I was able to get decent ones by using the pas mode at 400 iso and stabilizing the camera with a large fixed object (I don't have a tripod). Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to take decent pics without a lot of fuss.

$REVIEW.: option, but it's a chirpy sound card. Whenever the bass hits, the front speakers "chirp" a bit. Yes, it's usually drowned out by the bass (.1) speaker, but it's really noticeable at low volume. Thinking it's maybe a hardware conflict, but I'm pretty sure that it's not meant to drive a 2.1 system expanded to a 4.1. Will keep it, but will always keep in mind that if it always keeps the "chirp", I will look for a better quality sound card.

I didn't have any trouble with flares in my pictures (I also wasn't shooting towards a bright light source). And colors were a bit more vivid.  Also didn't have any trouble attaching it to a 18-55mm kit lens on my Nikon.Honestly though, for how cheap this is, you can't really complain about it.

$REVIEW.: This board and its components went together easier than any install I've had to do in the past

The manual was actually written in English by someone who knew English.There are only two quibbles
The board has 6 SATA ports but comes with 4 cables


Two of the ports are something special and they will require some special set up and I'm not quite sure what that is about.The board comes with a mounting kit already in place for just snapping the stock ADM heatsink/fan in place.This hits the sweet spots for the money - USB3, DDR3 to 1866GHz, SATA 6/GB.The back panel is without a doubt the best
It isn't just a flimsy foil like one normally gets
It clipped in positively and there are labels on it
Quite nicely done.If a friend asked I'd tell them this would be a good board for them.

Cause I use it with the "blueant ribbon" on my neck.The case is great.The overall finish is really good.When i plugged it with the "triple gel earbuds" it went deep and had a very snug fit I was confident the sound was going to be great.What a disappointment, the sound is decent but there is very little bass!!!! I am not a bass freak, but seriously when working out you want some bass right?? I don't know how with such a snug fit it do not produce any bass.The noise isolation is good.So if you want some great sound when working out, do not but it.If you want some decent sound and a snug fit. Then go ahead.Revision: Stay away from this, the grey buds are lose and you will lose them after a while for sure,t it will stay stucked in your ears...the memory cable lose its property after a while...still using it but not very good.

$REVIEW.: This camera shoot decent 720P video @24 fps that NO competitor exist at this price point. And it can zoom when shooting video! One caveat, when zooming the sound are muted temporarily to prevent zoom noise being recorded. And the zoom seems to have 3 discrete stages, not zoom continuously and smoothly like some other cameras.Mine comes with firmware v1.2. When first shooting HD video I got the notorious problem, i.e. video stopped after a couple seconds. I panicked. After format the SD card with NTFS format and then using the camera to format the card again the weird problem is gone. BTW I used a class 4 SDHC 4G card.The video capability is the main factor I am looking at. But I found the photos are decent as well. I haven't shoot much photos yet. The outdoor ones looks great. The indoor ones are average, but all point and shoot type don't do well at low light. I don't like to use flash either. If you plan to do a lot indoor or low light shooting, get a DSLR and low f-number lens. It all comes down to how many photons are collected by the CCD sensor.I do need some time to adjust to the controls, button layout and menu. Switching between shooting modes is a little inconvenient as you need to go through a few steps in the menu.The power button can be easily triggered. It's a little annoying and can cause potential damage. Imagine your camera is unintentionally turned on in that small camera case, the lens has no where to extend and you are screwed. Fuji should fix this problem.

$review_text.: Pros:- Sixaxis- Dualshock 3- Good QualityCons:- Price- Does not come with a charging cableI ordered both a white and blue controller to go with my red one that I have had for years. I was only disappointed when I opened these when I found that they did not come with a charging cable. I paid good money for a controller, and Sony can't even throw in an extremely cheap USB to miniUSB cable? I thought that was a little messed up. But, in terms of the controllers themselves, these are very solid controllers. The red one I have been using for years and several thousand hours of gaming still feels almost exactly like the new ones I ordered, the only difference being that the new ones have more knobbies and texture on them.When I needed more controllers for my PS3, I decided to spend the money to get a couple good controllers that I knew would last a long time and not give me any problems. Overall, these are great controllers and I definitely recommend them. Just be sure to order a charging cable when you order one of these.

$REVIEW.: With the latest firmware version, much of the "auto shutoff" and many other complaints from earlier poor reviews seem to no longer be valid.  There is however a newer problem entirely of Sony's making, and one they seem to have no desire to remedy. It has become a universal complaint across Sony internet products now (seems to have started a few months ago) that Netflix has serious problems during peak hours (6-10 pm central in my case), with it constantly pausing and buffering.  Just Google "sony netflix buffering" or check out their forums: [...] to see that, NO it is not a problem with people's networks or even Netflix themselves.  It is the fact that Sony pipes everything through their OWN servers, which is why the double sign-up that's been complained about in other reviews.  No other device plugged into my network has these problems, and I've tried a Roku, Xbox, numerous PCs, and even another brand Blu-Ray, only the Sony has trouble with Netflix.  Seeing as it was my #1 reason for purchasing it, that's why I knock it down 2 stars.On the plus side it plays Blu-rays and DVDs wonderfully, and other streaming services (Pandora being the other most-used) work well.

$review_text.: I recently picked up a Kindle 3 as a more portable, lightweight supplement to my Kindle DX. The Kindle 3, when paired with the standard cover with light, weighs about the same amount as the much larger, heavier Kindle DX (albeit with no cover on the DX, but still). It seems odd to me that the standard Kindle cover would be so heavy when they did such a remarkable job shrinking the Kindle itself and making it so light.So, not being satisfied with the standard cover, I purchased this Built sleeve. It seems to be the perfect Kindle 3 cover. It is extremely lightweight (significantly lighter than the standard cover), seems to be well made, and provides adequate protection. The inside is lined with what feels like soft microfiber fur that protects the screen from scratches etc.There's not much else to be said. If you're looking for a fancy leather cover that looks fancy and weighs a ton, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an extremely lightweight sleeve that happens to look nice and provide adequate protection, look no further. The only con I can think of is it's a little on the expensive side for what it is, but by no means do I regret buying it, and I would buy one again at the standard price in a heartbeat.

$REVIEW.: I've used this to switch between a live video camera output and a Windows 7 PC to support presentations displayed on an HD monitor.  No issues with any of the connections.  The remote is particularly useful, allowing direct selection of one of the 3 inputs without having to &#34;cycle&#34; through the sources.
$SUMMARY.: Good for presentations (PC and camera)

$review_text.: Wow!  Even after careful research, I was a bit apprehensive about what the sound quality would be like with this unit.  Simply put, it is amazing!  The unit is very thin and fairly small, but it puts out quite loud sound with amazing quality.  I was quite surprised by the great bass output.  Quite a feat for speakers in such a thin cabinet.I was able to unpack it, pair it with my laptop, and listen to music in about 10-15 minutes (most of the time was getting my laptop bluetooth turned on and ready to pair).  The unit is very simple to set up and operate.  I read another review that objected to the tones it gives when you setup pairing mode for bluetooth, but they are not that loud and they are very helpful.  You only have to pair once with any device anyway.  It paired easily and works like a champ.I have not tried the phone functions yet, but other reviewers gave them good marks, so I expect they'll work fine.  The unit seems well made and feels solid. Comes with a little slipcase cover, aux cable, and A/C adapter.  Some ask why not a rechargeable battery and that would be nice, but I am happy that it uses AA batteries. I use rechargeable AA's and I can have a fresh pack charging and 6 in the unit and swap 'em out easily.  And internal rechargeable batteries do eventually die and have to be replaced.  Remember the ipod fiasco?But, it's the sound, baby!  This little unit rocks.  It's not a boom box, but for normal listening it is quite fine and the tonal quality is excellent.  All in all, a great product.  I like it so much, I'm buying a second one.  Thumbs up!

It seemed to miss that step. The speaker and headphone jack was crackly. just get the latest one.

$review_text.: This is a great lens for the price.  Clear optics, fast speed, and light.  Unfortunately the lens is not packed typical of all Canon lenses, with styrofoam, etc.  Only a little bit of bubble wrap.  Amazon has the habit of Not really packing lenses sufficiently.  Long story short, I had to return the first two lenses, one due to shipping damage, another because of a factory defect.  Other than these concerns, excellent lens for the money, and is making this photographer get addicted to prime lenses.

I'm not sure if the rubber jacket is there as a gimmick or for function. It probably prevents scratches on the surface rather than helps protect the data. Anyway, it's all good. My data is still safe. I use it as a backup drive (Time Machine) for my macbook pro. And I've had to use it once to restore all my files (more than 400 GB!). I would have cried, and perhaps died, if not for it.

$review_text.: I've been streaming for a couple of years using a roku and other methods
I researched antennas on and off since cutting the cable but wasn't willing to go the outdoor route and the indoor antennas I checked got dismal reviews


I'm in a valley with a house and a tree obstructing the view and still got 40 channels! I added a 6 foot extension to the provided cable and placed it on the window closest to the TV - this location is obstructed but still the best spot available with the amount of cable I had on hand
My research led me to believe I might get 5 or 6 channels! Boy were those sites wrong! Many of these channels are in languages I don't speak, 7 or 8 are radio, but I'm also getting several PBS and all the network channels in English and some quirky San Francisco stations which is a big surprise! I was really hoping to get the SF channels so yep, very happy

FREE TV, but way better than the analog version of old
You can travel with this too which is great for people who live in different locations seasonally or for taking to the vacation house or for the RV


 I have it connected to an LG Infinia 42LV5400 120 Hz Smart TV which is a newer model.

$review_text.: It seems to be getting really difficult to buy a decent keyboard

 I bought two of these based on the reviews here
 I wanted something that was quiet to type on, and the volume controls were a plus
 But after using it for several months I don't find it to be all that quiet

 And the stylish rounding over of the front edge, along with all the front keys (space bar, arrows, etc.) is quite aggravating in actual use.I find the arrow keys on this keyboard to be the most annoying


 Along with the left, right, and down keys being so rounded over they are difficult to use, the up arrow is rounded in the opposite direction


 So when you try to use these keys, the rounded section actually dips below the top!  The function keys are really small and hard to press too

 Add to this the black motif, and you end up with a keyboard that is very difficult to use in low light conditions and almost impossible to use in games.I replaced this with a Targus AKB04US, which costs a little more but is quite a bit better.

$SUMMARY.: A victory of style over function

I have got a GoPro HD Hero, but mounting it on a helmet while riding a motorcycle just attracts too much unwanted attention. But with this ContourRoam mounted at the side of the helmet, anyone hardly noticed it.Plus the video quality is not bad, even in the night (although it is quite dark).Cons is the battery isn't replaceable, and you are not able to adjust the settings for exposures etc. Only able to adjust the mic sensitivity and recording mode.

The cover lines up perfectly to allow access to the ports.

$review_text.: I really want to like these a lot.  We bought two as gifts for our kids and each player has it's own quirks, and we nearly sent one back since it apparently died but came alive just before shipping away.They are so light and diminutive that they hardly weigh anything, and they don't have enough weight to cause concern for breaking.  It's as if they could be clipped on and forgotten.The interface is straightforward and the little back button was smart.  The final click of the headphone input is so stiff that you think you're going to break it by continuing to push (but the sound won't work unless you just force it).  It charges fast enough too.Syncing with the USB interface seems decent but definitely not fast, and using a fast micro SD card hasn't yielded the results you'd expect either.There's the major problem of random hangs, glitches that can freeze the player's software for moments or minutes at a time.  It's random, which grates against my scientific mind.Overall, I love the price and like the form factor.  If they both are working in a year then I'll come back and upgrade this review to four stars...

$review_text.: Overall, great camera.Strengths:Takes very good pictures (color, sharpness, etc)Easy to use, yet it has very advanced features available (including full manual)Fits well in my hand and the controls are well placed.Almost no shutter lagImage stabilization works well.Takes AA batteries.Weaknesses:Canon should have had 4 batteries in this camera! It would have resolved all these problems:-Long recharge time for flash (can't take pictures during this time)-Short battery life-Smaller grip than my PowerShot A80 - not as much space for my hand-I liked the slightly heaver feel of my A80But overall a great camera.  I would strongly recommend having at least 6 rechargeable AA batteries.  Two in the camera and two (or more) charged sets of two in the camera bag ready to put in the camera.It is better than my old A80 (which I loved and used for 4 years), but if they had put 4 AA batteries in it (like the A80) it would almost have been perfect.

$review_text.: When I first saw the DSC-U20 at the Sony Style showroom in midtown Manhattan, I was totally awed.  This is definitely the smallest digital camera on the market today, and the styling is superb, making it one of the things you want to own the moment you see it on display.Under the beautiful skin is a capable digital camera, with 1632x1224 resolution (good for prints up to 6"x4") and very good image quality.  The small flash does limit its use in dark settings, and the lack of optical zoom sticks out as a disappointment, but considering the typical use for a camera like this -- quick snapshots, party memories, candid exposures -- the overall package is still excellent and the feature compromises understandable.(For the ultra-cool and compact digital camera with optical zoom -- 3X at that! -- I heartily recommend the Minolta Dimage X and Xi, also available on Amazon.com.)The camera's lens, rated at the 35mm equivalent of 33mm (which makes it a wide-angle), is well made, as is the case with all of Sony's cameras.  The camera has center-weighted auto focus with macro capability, and also center-weighted auto exposure.  Shutter speed is rated in the 1/30 - 1/2000 range, typical for consumer-class digital cameras.  The LCD viewfinder measures 1", which is quite small but still usable to most people except those who need thick reading glasses.  You get a few digital effects (black&white;, negative, solarize, soft snap, etc.) when you do feel the creative juice flowing.  You can also take 160x112 MPEG-format video clips, but I find this feature pretty much uselessFor power the U20 uses two AAA NiMH rechargable batteries.  You can buy these batteries for cheap at Radio Shack, for example, and the camera kit comes with a recharger, although you can buy fancier ones that charge in less time and condition the batteries as well (actual benefit: unknown).  I've taken about 30 pictures, all with flash, so far, and the batteries are still good.  I definitely prefer these batteries to LiIon since 1) NiMH AAA is cheap and sold everywhere, and 2) they hold more power than LiIon and also have more rechargable cycles (i.e., they can be recharged more times).  I'll update the real-world battery life rating once I get a better picture of it.Weighing in at 4.5 ounces with batteries and sporting the "I'm just cool" styling of Sony, the U20 is a little digital camera you'll love and carry with you all the while.

It was hard to turn on and off and needed to have the reset button pushed quite often which means you need to have a small paper clip handy when using the unit
I got the Dual unit to replace the GNS5870
It powers on quite readily withe "normal' style buttons, gets the signal in a reasonable amount of time and seems to have plenty of battery life for a normal day of flying It comes with a cigarette lighter plug in to charge on the go also
It also come with a very nice rubber mounting pad so you can set it on the dash to get a clear signal

$REVIEW.: This cable works very well


 I like the snug fit of the RJ-45 connectors and the snag less clip protectors
 Pulling a cable out of a birds nest of wires always break the lock clips off of the cables, rendering them useless

 The snag less protectors prevent that from happening

 Other companies use snag less protectors that are awkward and almost require a pair of pliers to compress them

 These work very well

 Also, the choice of colors for the cables makes it easier for identification when you have several connections going on in one location at the same time.It's hard to believe you can get this quality at this price

 I highly recommend these cables.

$review_text.: I needed a simple but robust solution for a small hotel that was having wifi problems.Hotel is about 50 rooms, two stories, central hallway, interior concrete block walls, stairwell separates the last 16 rooms from the front portion.Purchased 3 of these since they have the option of being access points and repeaters/bridges.  I have one in each mode.The wireless bridge was perfect, since there were two brick walls separating two sections of the hotel, with a stairwell between them.  I have one router about 10 feet from each of the wall on opposite sides of the stairwell.  They are bridged on the 5ghz band, and performance in the &#34;bridged side&#34; is still excellent.  Two are in the plenum space and one is at the front desk.After a month in service, no performance issues and no downtime.Configuration was simple on the router connected to cable modem, service is Mediacom.Config on the next wired router was easy as well.  The router in wireless bridge mode was a little more complicated, since you need to decide which band will be dedicated to the bridge.  I choose the 5ghz band since I was able to get better signal through the walls around the stairwell.I'd recommend this unit for home use to anyone, and for a small office as well.
$SUMMARY.: Have 3 and they are all performing great

 Wish I could give them 6 stars!!!!

$review_text.: Overall this grip is significantly cheaper than the OEM Canon version, yet there are a few issues.  The mount screw works fine until you reach the "fully on position" where the screw is turned as far as it can go. You would expect it to stop wiggling but the knob keeps wiggling back and forth. The grip is on, secure, but the knob has too much play in it. The on/off slider doesn't slide fully into the on position even though the grip is on, and the slider is crooked/wiggly. Finally, on the top of the grip where it fits snug next to the body of the camera there is extra plastic that obviously didn't get trimmed off in the finishing stage.

$REVIEW.: The Canon G1X is a nitch camera

 It does low light high ISO shots very very well
 Its image stabilization is well up to Canon standards

 Its color rendition of things like flowers is spot on.Now for the "but".It is sloooow, oh so sloooow
 If your subject is moving any faster than a tree, forget it


 Delay between pushing the shutter button and actual operation of the shutter can often be measured in seconds

 After the shot is acutally taken, the cycle time to be ready for the next shot can also be measured in seconds


 I tried taking some shots of my 20 month old grandson

 I got 0 for 8


 It makes my S95 look lightening fast.It's too big to carry in anything but a largish coat pocket so you have to plan ahead to have it with you, just like a DSLR
 My DSLR (D7000) can't do low light quite as well as the G1X but it can do a whole lot of things the G1X can't do.The special lens cap is a pain and I was always concerned about losing the darn thing, knowing a replacement would have to be special ordered.I ordered it because of its low light capabilities and because of the big sensor's resolution potential

 In the end, I returned it because $799 was too much money for its limited usefulness


 For that money, I could buy a new Ipad, which I may well do and which I will probably use and enjoy more.

$review_text.: First of all, I've had 4 Canon cameras before this one (the legendary A80, the A95, the recent A560, and the Rebel XT, which was stolen). Also, I work as a photographer for a local newspaper and we constantly use high-end Canon SLRs and G series compact canons. Let me tell you that the quality of this little guy (the first Elph I've had) is impressive. Actually, I would say this is on top with the "G" and SLR series picture quality, if you know how to make a few adjustments.I've had the powershot SD1000 for 6 months, I've taken it to a few trips, parties, work events, and I carry it in my pocket every day. The features it has (like face detection, digital macro, time-lapse video, color accent, etc.), for the price, are fantastic. However, the best thing this camera offers, IMHO, is a quick operation. It takes VERY FAST pictures, and if you set the color to vivid, with a proper white balance, the images you get will surprise you. I recently had a trip to Cancun and took the camera with me. When I came back I wrote an article about my trip for the Sunday Magazine at my newspaper, and they used my pictures, as they looked very professional.If you're a casual photographer, you can't beat this price,  get it now.There's ONE thing, however, I still hope canon introduces in the future: a more practical video mode format.I'm not saying the video quality is bad. Actually it is the best I've seen in ultra-compacts. The thing is, that after having owned a Pentax Optio s5z for a year (before this one), which used good quality divx compression (much smaller files), I found myself taking many videos without worrying about remaining space in the memory card. The "video thing" started growing a lot on me. However, canon uses almost no compression in the AVI files and so, for each 1GB of memory, you can only record 8 minutes of video (2GB = only 16 minutes!).About the image stabilization: I don't miss it. If your hands are not very shaky and you use the proper ISO, you can overcome this. However, if you're using 1600 ISO, you will see "grains" unless you keep the picture to "web sharing" size. It's normal with compact cameras.My next camera will be (if it's still on sale) the SD750, because I recently found it has a 3 inch LCD, and I don't really use the viewfinder in SD1000 (a personal choice).Bottom line: for vacations, every day use, social snapshots, pets, the occasional "artistic" inspiration, fantastic response and pro-quality images at a very affordable price, you can't go wrong with this camera.

$review_text.: I received this in the mail yesterday and am typing this review on it.  Overall it's a great little addition to your Nexus 7-great for productivity. The case is sturdy and the stand is an added bonus. The keyboard is removable-held by Velcro very firmly-so you can use it independent of the case. Of course it adds bulk to your tablet, the thickness of a small hardcover book. For some people the keys might be too small, but since I've been doing most of my writing on an Asus eee PC,I like the size. Speaking of keyboard, some buttons like the apostrophe are in a different place and the Caps Lock tends to stick if every so often, but I chalk that up to being brand new.  My only issue thus far is that there were no instructions inside of the box, which means spending a little extra time in setting it up. Be very careful to select English as the language default or you will end up typing your essays in Serbo-Croatian. Overall, it's worth the purchase.

$review_text.: This review is not about how the product actually performs as a wireless network because the setup and limited configuration abilities have prevented me from using it so far. I will update this review later this week with information about the wireless network abilities of the device. The problem is that I need to basically take down my entire home network in order to temporarily substitute this device so that I can test it.The first major problem that I encountered, that might not be a problem for the average user, is that this device does not have the ability to extend an existing wireless network. It must be connected directly to the modem in order to connect to the Internet. This was a problem for me because I currently have my main wireless router in the center of my home and a second wireless router at one end that extends this network. The plan was to integrate this router into my network as a wireless network extender at the other end of the house. This is simply not possible with this router.The second plan was to take it across the street to my neighbor. He has a pretty average network with a DSL modem and one wireless router. The plan was to test his current wireless router, then replace it with this one and test again. I wanted to see if this one had extended range because he currently has an issue with wireless range at one end of his home. Well, we never were able to set it up because since he has DSL that requires the router to enter bridge mode and I could not find this option anywhere. The worst part is that according to the wizard everything was fine and the Internet light on the front of the router turned green. This is supposed to indicate that everything is good and we are connected to the Internet. When we tried to use our devices (iPhone and PC) neither of them had an Internet connection. They had a good connection to the wireless router but it was not providing access to the Internet. We finally gave up.At this point I have to throw in a comparison here. My current network has anApple AirPort Extreme Base Station (Simultaneous Dual-Band) (MC340LL/A)as the device connected to my modem and located at the center of my home, anApple AirPort Extreme Base Station MB053LL/A [OLD VERSION] at one end of the house, and aSecurifi Almond - World's 1st Touch Screen Wireless N Router + Range Extender + WiFi Bridgeat the other end of the house. The setup on all three of these devices puts this D-Link to shame. The Almond has a color touchscreen so all of the setup is right on the device. It is dead easy to extend an existing network. The AirPort Extremes are setup via an iOS app or Mac Utility and they are extremely easy to setup in both basic and advanced settings.D-Link has a lot that they can learn from both Apple and Securifi. The method they are using for setup is so antiquated that it is more of a hinderance than a help.

$review_text.: Ricoh digital point and shoot cameras aren't your traditional point and shoot cameras.  Take the GR III, it's not the smallest or doesit have the longest zoom lens or is it the cheapest.  Actually, it's pretty pricey. And it's not for everyone.  And if I hadn't gotten it for free, I wouldn't have bought it. But now that I have had some time to use it, I really like it.As I said above, this isn't the smallest camera. It's considerably bigger than the newer Canon SD series. However, it will comfortably fit in a shirt pocket. It is also quite a bit heavier. The body appears to be of metal with a rubber covered grip.  The grip is nice sized and very comfortable. There is a nice 3" LCD on the back for composing and viewing images.  As has become the norm on P&S; cameras, there isn't an optical viewfinder. On the top, there is the typical power button, shutter release, and mode dial. A nice little feature is that the mode dial locks so that it can't change settings accidently. Also on top is a hot shoe for using an external flash. You almost never see this on a camera this small. The camera also has a small built in flash.On the subject of a zoom lens, there isn't one.  The GRIII comes with a fixed 28mm (35 equivalent), fast f1.9 lens. Why no zoom lens? My guess is that Ricoh went for quality here (and they achieved it). This wide angle lens is great for landscapes, shooting around the house, street photography, and macro shots. And with the fast f1.9 aperture, you can easily control the depth of field to blur the background if desired.The camera has many shooting features. Some, like Snap Focus, the leveling aid, and High contrast B&W; mode are not found on any other P&S; cameras. I recommend you download the manual (available on Ricoh's website) and read up on these if you're thinking of getting this camera.For me, the most important aspect of a P&S; is image quality. Due to the small sensor size, you get more noise and less detail than digital SLRs. In P&S; cameras, there are two basic sizes. The smallest (the one in most P&S; cameras) and a slightly larger one that is found in the bigger sized point and shoot cameras. The larger one is found in the bigger Canon G11, G12, and Nikon s7000 cameras. As I write this, there are only 3 really pocketable cameras that use the bigger sensor... the Canon S90, its replacement the S95, and this camera. In this case size does matter. The larger sensor gives you a lot less noise and better detail. Couple this with the Ricoh's lens and very good image processing engine, and you end up with images that are better than most. I've been happy with 13 x 19 inch prints and probably could go bigger. Is it as good as a digital SLR? No, but it close and nowhere near as big and heavy.In conclusion, this camera is not for everyone.  The casual shooter taking holiday pictures would be better served by a smaller, cheaper point and shoot. But if you normally use a wide angle lens, want a lot of shooting features, and the highest image quality you can get in a pocketable camera, give this a look.

$REVIEW.: I installed this on a new Windows 8.1 based PC.Initially, I had an odd issue of my PC not displaying anything on a monitor hooked up to DVI port

 Then I connect another monitor to a VGA port and suddenly the display comes back to both monitors

 Same thing happened again when upgrading video driver versions


 Windows 8.1 tries to switch video driver versions then I lose my display
 I connect something to VGA port and I get my display back

 I also noticed, when BIOS boots, it did not display manufacturer's logo


 I've called ASUS tech support but the agent I spoke with kept beating around the bush and did not assist me

 According to him, it is working, so I had nothing to worry about.It took me 3 days of research and logical deduction to figure this out


 Apparently, this video card shipped with a firmware made for traditional BIOS

 So when connected to UEFI based machines (which Windows 8 requires), security verification fails, then it goes into this odd behavior
 There are two ways to resolve this.1)  Upgrade the firmware on this video card to UEFI ready version2)  Turn off UEFI in BIOS and go back to traditional modeI took the latter route as it was easier

 Now everything works as it should

 Performance is perfectly acceptable for my use


 Having an ability to do dual display is great
 I may hook up a third in near future.Conclusion is, this video card, as shipped, is not truly Windows 8 compliant

 At least mine was not


 If anyone is having odd issues, my suggestion is to verify the BIOS version, then try disabling UEFI bios if possible.

$review_summary.: Works well after odd issues were sorted out

$REVIEW.: I thought to myself that people exaggerate and it just couldn't be That good! Especially for its size and weight but this thing is incredible for sure!!! My girlfriend was in the other room when I brought it home and set it up...Then I turned it on and adjusted bass/treble and turned it up to 20, (it goes up to 40 but 20 was PLENTY!) She walked in the room where I was at with her mouth hanging open and said "OMG I thought it was HUGE by the sound of it, but it's just a normal size boombox!" Believe the hype people cause this thing can get down and dirty right now!!!
$SUMMARY.: Even after reading all the rave reviews didn't prepare me.

$review_text.: This device really helps me keep my phone and Kindle charged. Occasionally I use it for the MP3 player as well. The only thing that isn't perfect is that the swivel mechanism loosens pretty quickly, so it slips out of position fairly easily when plugging into the outlets. I especially bought this model because unlike others, it doesn't block the second wall outlet. You don't gain much with those others if you block both wall outlets, then get 3 outlets on the device. In this case. you end up with 4 outlets, which is nice, though I don't use the outlets often.
$SUMMARY.: Very helpful

$review_text.: I purchased 3 pairs of these 8" speakers, 2 pairs of 6.5 and 1 pair of 4" water proof. All of these speakers are for my basement remodel. I purchased them in March and just got to installing them now (September). I opened the first box of 8" speakers and one of the speakers has a hole. I contacted the manufacture and requested warranty service this is the response from support@pyleaudio.com:"This is considered cosmetic wear, it will not affect the performance of the speaker. We would suggest either a small patch or a durable tape to cover the hole. We would only replace it providing the speaker was blown or unable to produce sound."So I hooked the speaker up and the speaker makes a hideous rattle sound on every bass note. I contacted support again and told them of the situation and have received no response, obviously they have chosen not to stand behind their product. In the mean time I choose to set that speaker aside and use a speaker from one of the other boxes. While the replacement speaker is intact the sound is distorted even at low levels. I have a custom built recording studio as part of my basement remodel and these speakers where to be used as monitors so they did not have to be of outstanding, but I expected to at least be able to hear the music with some semblance of clarity.Bottom line, these speakers are of very poor quality and the manufacturer will not honor their own warranty.
$SUMMARY.: Very poor quality! Do not buy these speakers!

$review_text.: I needed a 20 foot cable and I found this on Amazon at a very reasonable price.  It wowed me with the nylon cover.  The cover makes it easier to move in and out of areas with other cables.  I'm impressed.

$review_text.: The picture is perfect, the interface is smooth, 3D is impressive, and it has plenty of options and ports.  I was worried about getting a plamsa, but now that I have it I know I made the right decision.Do yourself a favor though, look up the CNET calibration settings, they can make a big difference.  I ended up bumping up the contrast a bit more from their settings since I have a lot of light in the room.
$SUMMARY.: Amazing, couldn't be happier

$REVIEW.: I plugged this thing in and was afraid maybe it would take awhile for my computer to find and use it or something wouldn't work, but I was wrong. My computer instantly recognized it when it didn't pick up WiFi. This thing works great, their is no lag or slowing down of the connection at all. I would definitely recommend this product.

It took me over an hour to reformat the drive due to lack of software in the box. if any came with it. USB cord is really short.. I guess  I got what I paid for.. will spend the extra dollar next time and get the better product.

$review_text.: I've used OS X since its advent and it was nice to have an OS that seemed to get things right.  Over the years Apple has made a lot of good changes to the OS, but the last two updates only seem to make things worse / frustrating.  I won't get into specific nitpicking over the OS here, but just wanted to mention that as good as this laptop is it's sad that the OS is holding it back at times.The laptop itself is awesome.  Just the right size and weight.  Not too thin and not too thick.  The screen is great... but FYI the default resolution in OS X for Retina displays is much lower than the native res.  The native resolution on these laptops is 2560x1600 but OS X wants to run it as &#34;Best for Retina&#34; resolution which is a High DPI pixel doubled 1280x800 resolution.  Luckily there are utilities you can get that will let you push the resolution up to native or at least higher than the 1680x1050 maximum OS X lets you set it to natively.  I run it at 2048x1280 when I want to maximum screen space... which is about as comfortable of a resolution you can make it on such a tiny screen.  You can run it at 2560x1600, but be aware that the rendered text is so tiny you have to get super close just to read it.There is something to be said for the quality and image sharpness in the High DPI modes over native resolution modes... but it comes down to what is more important to you.  When coding on it I appreciate as much screen space as I can get when doing UI layout... but appreciate being able to read the text more at the lower resolutions.  I suggest installing one of the few utilities that let you switch between 2 resolutions quickly and keep a lower and higher resolution always at the ready for whichever best suits your need at that moment.Also performance-wise I have no complaints.
$review_summary.: Great laptop... less great OS
