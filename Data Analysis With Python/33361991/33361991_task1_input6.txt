$REVIEW.: This ram works great! Fitted right in, and it runs super nice! They are very durable and look really slick! I bought them for my new gaming rig because of my AMD-FX4170 Q4 processor

Running the fastest ram that my processor can handle makes things so much nicer! I would highly recommend this ram! It's fast and reliable! :D

$REVIEW.: Last time I checked, new iPods are going for upwards of $200.  In fact, the cheapest iPod Touch on Apple's site is listed at $229.  That's a pretty good chunk of change.  They are amazing devices - compact, condensed entertainment centers small enough to slip easily into - or out of - a pocket.  I resisted giving into the iPod's allure for years before I finally caved in and bought one, seduced by it's shiny metal casing, bright display and capability of holding my entire music collection.  But, holding it in my hands, it felt small, almost TOO small, and slippery.  I was sure that one day I would drop mine.  Sure enough, one of the most common things that breaks on iPods is the screen.  Almost every one of my friends who has had one has dropped it, and had to pay to have the screen replaced.  iPod repair shops are popping up all over, so it's pretty easy to find someone to do it, but it's gonna cost you upwards of $50 - $65.  Possibly more.  I decided to invest in a good case to protect my iPod, and one of the best is the OtterBox line, so for my first iPod, I went to WalMart and paid (if I recall correctly) around $25 for a new OtterBox case.And THAT was on clearance.Oh sure, it was a very good case, fully enclosing my iPod with it's hybrid plastic-and-rubber uber-protective goodness.  Even had a thin plastic screen protector built in.  My iPod was safe.Fast-forward to now.  After nearly two years of good and faithful service, my old iPod Touch 2g had to go.  I bought a newer Touch 4g and needed a new case to protect my new pride and joy, but I had learned a few things since I bought that OtterBox case - you can get the same level of protection for less.  MUCH less!I found this hybrid case here on Amazon.  For less than $5, I decided to take a chance, and I am very happy that I did!  The new case arrived on time, in a simple plastic bag - no fancy packaging, but that's ok with me.  There were no instructions, but it's not too hard to figure out how it goes on the iPod.  I peeled off the rubber outer layer, separated the tabs along the sides of the clamshell-type case that hold it together and opened it up.  Just like the more expensive, branded, official OtterBox case.  It even has the screen protector and the little window on the back for the Apple logo to show through.  The plastic and rubber seem to be similar quality and thickness as the OtterBox, and I suspect will offer a similar degree of protection.  All the buttons work perfectly well, just as good as they do with the case off.  The case adds a little thickness to the back, which should help to protect the camera lens, and also gives the iPod slightly more heft, and the rubber makes it more &#34;grippy,&#34; making it easier to hold onto your iPod (and less likely you'll drop it in the first place).  The near complete coverage of this case should help protect the iPod from moisture, but I still wouldn't suggest taking it for a swim.Negatives?  Well, I found no inherent flaws with the case, but you have to bear in mind that this case does fully enclose your iPod, leaving only a couple of covered access ports at the bottom where the headphones and charge/sync cable plug into.  Because of the design of the case, not all sync cables will fit through the case, so you may have to get a sync cable with a smaller profile or you'll end op taking your iPod out of its case every time it needs a charge, and that's not as simple as just snapping the case off.  And you can pretty much forget about using docking stations while the case is on.  This is not a design flaw of the case, however.  It is necessary, given the added thickness the case adds, which is necessary to provide the level of protection the case promises.Overall, a very good case.  As good as the name-brand ones at literally 1/10th the price!  Very cheap and worthwhile protection for your iPod!

$REVIEW.: I bought these headphones to replace another pair that I've had for a few years.  I have to say that comfort wise my previous JVC's were more comfortable. It seems that the sony's have relatively small pads for the ears that sit on your ears as opposed to over the ears.soundwise, I would say that they are somewhat comprable.I do like that they come in red as opposed to all my black headphones.

$REVIEW.: This Bluetooth mouse is probably the best one on the market right now in this price range. I have been using this mouse with a Dell laptop running Windows 7 for a few weeks now. The tracking is accurate and responsive, and works on a wide range of surfaces. The buttons and scroll wheel click solidly without a problem. The blue Windows 8 button is a nice touch. Swiping up and down on it will cycle back/forth through whatever option you set it to, and pressing the button will open the Start menu. The mouse is also comfortable to hold, with rubber grooves on the side for your hand. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Bluetooth mouse.

$review_text.: UPDATE NOV. 19, 2013:  Wow, was totally taken by surprise today: I pulled the cord from the headphone and *bam* the whole housing just snapped apart into 2-3 pieces. What a disappointment. If it weren't for this, I would have left this review at 4 stars because everything else about this headphone from the sound to noise cancelling features works great.  But broken headphones are obviously not wearable. For now I'm returning to a pair of Sony MDRZX-300 for travel purposes until I found another set of noise cancelling cans.----------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:I picked up a pair of these at a local discount electronics store for ~$40 incl. taxes.  These are not perfect headphones, but at this pricepoint think they are excellent value for money. I travel often for business and the noise cancelling does wonders to block out outside noise. It will not block out ALL noise, mind you, but I'd say 80% of outside noise cannot be heard (I prefer it this way as I do want to hear the airline staff make announcements over the PA in the plane). For comparison, I listen to Sennheiser HD555 at home -- and while the soundstage is not as natural as those, it's really excellent and MUCH better than what you will get with other cans at this price.  I'm very pleased with the sound: mids are clear, highs are crisp without being fatiguing and bass is more than adequate without being boomy (I do not like thudding bass - I want presence, but I don't want to be deafened by boomy blasting of my ear drums).  Overall, the sound signature is clear and spatial enough for my enjoyment on the many flights I take.Comfort-wise, these are very comfortable, even when I have my glasses on.  To be clear, these are supra-aural headphones, and they are NOT designed to cover your entire ear, but instead sit on top of them. The earpads do a great job at creating a tight seal, which I personally think is why they are so good at noise cancelling -- not because of the NC circuitry inside (though it seems to help), but the earpads themselves create a tight seal. I can use these for a few hours at a stretch with no issue. Very comfortable.It should also be noted, these are closed-back headphones, so your music will not escape and bother those around you.  This is something consumers overlook easily, but shouldn't, especially if you plan to use your headphones on public transit or in a shared office environment.Construction-wise, yes, as other reviewers have stated, the plastic piece that holds the cans to the headband is probably not going to hold up for the long haul, so I invested $20 in a headphone case from Timbuk2 -- and recommend that if you plan to travel often with these to do the same. SeeTimbuk2 Gear Headphone CaseThe self-winding cable mechanism seems solid to me, but I do recommend you hold the cable slightly as it retracts to keep it neat and prevent tangleups. I personally really like this feature.At this price, you are not going to get a headphone that includes all three of the following:* noise cancellation* good sound with wide frequency respsone* solid constructionAt this price, JVC had to cut corners somewhere and in my opinion did it with the construction using the plastic pieces that connect the cans to the headband.Depending on how you look at it, it was a design oversight or a conscious decision to lower the cost of manufacturing.The plastic for me has held up well with throwing these headphones into my laptop bag multiple times.  But again, I recommend investing in a headphone case for travel (I'd do this regardless of the brand of headphone purchased).
$review_summary.: Fantastic sound for price, but yes, they are cheaply constructed and will not last more than a few months.

$REVIEW.: The backpack works great, the iPhone app upgrade makes wonders to record and at least have a Preview before the shot.  When used with the iPhone it works flawless, but for some reason (even with last updates) when used with the remote control it crashes and freeze the GoPro (Hero 2).  Now with a Hero 3 I see no future upgrade releases to fish this.  So if you are OK with using always the phone as remote this is great, if not, consider the possibility that some times you won't have a great shot, instead a frozen camera (which is kind of tricky to get it out that freeze)

$REVIEW.: This is my first external battery pack for mobile devices and I'm very pleased with it so far.I have an original iPad, iPhone 5, and a Google Nexus 7 I intend to use this with.The device came almost fully charged...3 of the 4 LEDs were lit and the 4th flashing, it did not take long to complete the charge with my wall charger and the provided USB cable, maybe 2 hours tops.  It does take a LONG time to fully charge this battery packAfter it was fully charged, I used it to charge my Nexus 7, which was at 3%.  I wanted to see how it would charge while I used my Nexus...it did NOT...I actually slipped down to 2% while surfing the web and playing around with some apps for a few minutes.  I then closed all my apps but the Kindle app and was able to read(with brightness down) and charge at the same time.  Seems like heavy use of the tablet will eat up all your charge power and drain the battery more, but with just the Kindle app running I was able to charge while reading.It took over 10 hours to fully charge my Nexus 7, altho I was using it for 45 minutes or so during that time which will make it take longer to charge...After the Nexus charged, the Anker was down to 1 full LED and 1 flashing LED...so the tablet, as expected, did a good job taking all my juice, but I still had enough to fully charge my iPhone.  The iPhone charged overnight so I'm not sure how long it took.  NOTE:  The iPhone, unlike the tablet, still charged even when I was using it extensively.It only comes with 1 micro USB cable, and does NOT come with a wall charger, you will need to provide your own charger and cables for anything other than micro USB.I have not tested charging 2 devices at once, but will try to do so and follow up in my review.Comes with a handy carrying pouch.Its HEAVY, very dense.The included cable is not very long, maybe 2 feet.

$REVIEW.: I ordered 2 of these. They arrived in record time and in excellent condition ... Except one had a broken monitor base, that is why the 4 STARS instead of 5. This was not a major problem since I was going to mount one on a wall. I did not contact the supplier. Both machines booted up and ran exactly as they should. One small problem for me was I was going to use a Video card with the unit to stream a remote camera. Because of the desktop format the card wouldn't fit. My fault, I should have payed closer attention to the specs. I used a PCI extender w/cable and layed the card down in the case ... problem solved. Both units are online 24/7 to monitor (Video & audio) an elderly parent at home for safety and security. After weeks of use both units have worked without a glitch. The seller did a good job and I would buy from them again. Dollar for dollar can't beat it, They are refurbished but looked very good.

$REVIEW.: I bought this setup December, 2009, for one of my daughters to use with her TV and iPod. Both of us are more then satisfied with them.Her living room is about 10x12 and when watching movies the sound is actually quite good. You don't really feel the bass punch you in the chest for things like explosions and car crashes, but no one can realistically expect anything like that to come from a sub-$50 set of speakers. Her music from the iPod sounds clear and powerful, surprisingly so when you realize how small the satellites and subwoofer really are. The sound lacks a bit of lower midrange, but certainly nothing too discernible.All-in-all the CA-3550 speakers just can't be beat, not at this price. Highly recommended.

It does fit my visor perfectly and is totally unobtrusive which I liked.  After getting the replacement and using it, I will try to update this review.UPDATE.  I returned the NEO for a replacement as I liked how it was suppose to work.  I received the replacement NEO and it works perfectly .  I have turned off magic words and use the buttons to receive and hangup a call.  The battery lasts a few weeks with the way I use it.

$REVIEW.: I have no doubt that the DiNovo Mini is brilliant with a PC.  As soon as it arrived at my office, I had it up and running in XP without any more effort than plugging in the Bluetooth receiver.  Mouse control, character entry, menu use, et cetera were all great.Unfortunately, I bought this for my PS3.I primarily wanted the DiNovo Mini for PS3 browser use.  Browsing with a virtual keyboard is intensely annoying, so a keyboard is the only option for extended use.  As a character entry and mouse control device, the Mini works great with the PS3.  There are button mappings for the cross and circle buttons, allowing for basic selection and cancellation controls.Where the Mini fails, however, is that it does not seem to have anything mapped to the triangle, square, and Start controls.  Triangle is used to access menus all over the PS3 interface, including the PS3 browser menu.  Want to access your bookmarks with the Mini?  What you'll need to do is grab a PS3 controller to do it.  Want to type in an URL?  Pick up a PS3 controller, press Start, and then pick up the Mini and do your typing.Outside of the browser, the Mini also fails as a Blu-Ray playback controller.  To access menus during playback, one must use the square button.  Again, not on the Mini so grab a controller to pull up that menu.  Want to skip to the next chapter?  The controls on the Mini do forward and reverse seek only when used with a PS3.  Grab a controller and use L1/R2.There are so many occasions when you're reaching for a controller that it makes the Mini near useless.  For $150, I expected a lot more from a device that has a PS3 mode.  I would have been better off buying a cheap little controller mounted keypad.I think the keyboard itself is fantastic.  Great form factor, loved the lighting schemes, and it controls a PC like a champ.  But if your intended use is as an input for a PS3, do not buy it unless you're okay juggling both a controller and the Mini.

$review_text.: What can I say - this is the second Garmin I have had.  The first one I had for five years and the screen finally gave away to my touch. So I bought this one after much research. The sound quality is great and I really enjoy the side bar. The speed limit is sometimes not correct. I think this is due to the fact when there is a speed revision and I haven't received the update yet. This has happened in VA. We just had a speed increase about two months ago and the Garmin is reading five under. But I feel this will change when I receive the updates. I also like the other features is shows on the sidebars and looking for Entertainment, Gas Stations, etc. has been very exact. You should invest in this product if you need a GPS. You will NOT be dissatisfied.

 Wireless is good

 Update procedure is buggy and it seems new firmware did not fully kick in for several days, despite what diagnostics said

 Now it is working similarly to when I first got the radio (which is still buggy, but at least it plays music)

 Raising to a cautious 3 stars.***End Update***Running the latest firmware as shown above
 Wireless is now BROKEN beyond belief
 Will only work properly with ethernet

 This is kind of a big deal
 Wireless issues include:- Impossible to join network most of the time (even though it worked fine in the past).- Loses connections too easily, even strong signals.- Music stops mere seconds after starting, then FREEZES.- Menu options disappear from time to time, making it hard to choose stuff


 Duh.- Forgets wireless settings and even its own NAME
 Re-typing such text with the wheel is slow torture on this device.- Absolutely unreliable in general, so don't risk using it as an alarm clock.- Rebooting/resetting/reinstalling firmware improves nothing.As an IT pro, I troubleshoot network devices all the time


 The last thing I need is to come home to this crap
 Such a shame, because the product worked quite well until the last couple of firmware updates

 A few tolerable bugs existed before, but nothing like this


 I don't understand how others using the same firmware are suddenly having all their prayers answered
 My experience is quite the opposite.Other general complaints:- "Diagnostics" do not actually diagnose anything

 Just tells you current settings.- Startup/shutdown chime is completely inappropriate in a product aimed for the bedside radio market


 Loud/obnoxious


 Bad design decision.- Device sometimes gets confused about whether things are connected via line-out, etc.- Look and feel of the text wheel needs work

 Poor visual feedback when spinning/pressing to enter text


 Always seems like I'm spinning the wheel in the wrong direction, for example.- No weather app?  Actually no new apps at all to my knowledge since the debut of the device

 Sad.- No battery or remote yet

 VERY expensive pricetag for accessories that don't exist.I cannot recommend this product at this time

 Seriously looking at a Sony Dash or just re-purposing an old laptop.

$review_text.: It's an Intel NIC can you even ask for more

I wanted to use this NIC on a Windows Server 2008 x64 file server the drivers on the Intel web site specify x64 as being supported, however I could never get the NIC to appear under Server 2008.I am still using it but on another server that runs on x86.

$REVIEW.: This USPEED docking station is easy to install and use. No drivers needed, just plug it in to eSATA or USB 3.0/2.0 port, connect power and it is done.  Device seems solid and it is easy to load 2.5 or 3.5 inch SATA drives into the device. Has power switch and drive light.Works fast on both eSATA or USB 3.0. Transfer speeds with a large folder of mixed files was in the range of 60MB to 110MB per second.  The manual (2 pages ) is available for download from the site WWW.USPEED.CO.  Customer service from the USA office, LAPMATE is fast via e-mail.Great for formatting and erasing drives, exchanging data and cloning drives and the price is right!Jim D

$REVIEW.: It has a very inconsistent performance. When it works, it works well. Many a times it does not recognize the drive, or it stops reading the drive and I have to unplug the drive and reconnect it.It is especially inconsistent in reading the mobile hard drives that also need power from USB port.

$REVIEW.: I typically buy external enclosures for old hard drives. I recently bought a new desktop and decided to upgrade older enclosures in order to take advantage of the computer's 3 USB 3.0 ports. Since I'm a poor grad student, and had already shelled out plenty of cash for the computer, I was looking for an inexpensive enclosure with decent reviews. Despite being skeptical of a &#34;tool free&#34; enclosure that also claimed to be portable. At $10 with a 4-Star rating, this seemed like a good bet, and I was curious enough to give the whole &#34;tool free&#34; thing a try, and bought 2. They arrived late, due to inclement weather, and in the most beat-up package I've ever seen. Somehow, they still worked, though.FINAL VERDICT: The transfer speed doesn't come close to the one advertised (which is typical of aftermarket enclosures). I wouldn't recommend it for portability, as the connections come loose, and it should definitely be kept in a carrying case due to the aluminum construction. That said, it's inexpensive, and has gotten the job done for about 2 months. It's definitely faster than any USB 2.0 enclosure I've ever had. Read below for more detail.Pros:-Price They're half the price of most other USB 3.0 enclosures out there-Totally &#34;Plug & Play&#34;-Works with Windows 8/8.1 (If you're unfortunate enough to have it)-Cable: The connector on the case is pretty loose, but the cables themselves are pretty sturdy. I had better luck connecting them to my WD Passport than I did with the factory cable. The speed isn't great, though.Cons: I know using caps is annoying, but I felt it necessary, because some of these issues could be serious if not considered.-INTERNAL CONNECTION/PORTABILITY:  Due to it's &#34;tool free,&#34; nature, the hard drive frequently disconnects from the internal SATA bridge when moved, so it really isn't great in terms of portability. I don't carry them around much, and they have still become disconnected several times. I actually thought they had stopped working after 3 days, but they had really just come loose, even though they had been in cases, and hardly moved. If they were carried in a backpack, I'd be willing to bet that they would need to be opened and reconnected to the drive every time you reached a new destination-EXTERNAL CONNECTION: No matter what cable I've tried, the external connection seems to be loose and week, which definitely decreases transfer speeds, and increases the likelihood of accidental disconnection if the drive is bumped while connected, which is not good for the hard drive.CONSTRUCTION: The top is aluminum, which can cause the case to fail or even kill the drive if you don't make sure to discharge any static electricity before you touch it. I've been shocked twice, after which the enclosure stopped working for a couple of days and then randomly started working again. KEEP IT IN A CARRYING CASE! The plastic on the bottom is also weak, and it can be difficult to open. Initially I was afraid of breaking it.-Speed: Doesn't live up to the 5Gbps as advertised. The best I've gotten is about 3 when connected to a good cable
$Helpful?.: [0, 2] $SUMMARY.: Gets the job done, SATA bridge dislodges often.

$review_text.: The iReceiver is a very compact wifi streamer. You will amazed how small it is and how it has a wifi chip and a server running on it. First connect to a microUSB power adapter 5 V 0.5A. I had plenty of wall chargers lying around. Connect it and configure the device. First change the admin password to something complex (letters/characters). Then connect to AirMobi_xxxx.  Change the SSID name as well as encryption. It is default to none. make it WPA2 Personal and give a complex passphrase (letter/characters/symbols). Save all.After that Just connect the unit to power and speaker through 3.5 mm audio cable. Now install the iReceiver app from android. QR code is provided with the manual. Once the app is launched, it searches the mp3 in your android (I tried with a Samsung Galaxy S4). The app is very primitive and I hope it is updated. It shows all of the songs as a flat structure. Default it lays to phone speaker. Change to  Wireless mode. and voila. The songs start playing on the remote wireless connected speaker. I find the best use in van as you can connect the unit and people from back can control through the back and kep using the phone or tablet. No messy wires!I was provided this product to review in exchange of a fair and honest review.

Saved myself over a thousand dollars and this unit actually does more than the factory one :) Love the new Garmin as it does about everything you can think of


The only con I have about this unit and maybe the same as the other Garmins is that when it auto zooms after starting to accelerate the screen momentarily goes blank for a split second..just me but a little annyoing

$review_text.: I love this product. It's tiny, quiet, nice looking, and easy to install and use. The cost for 320 gigs of storage space is awesome. It came with preinstalled software on it for backuping and other purposes, but I uninstalled the software. I use the drive for storing video files that I edit in Final Cut Pro. It's been doing me just fine so far.As with any good review of a computer harddrive, I really should include a comment as to how long the product has served me and remained functional. Well, I got this product several months ago, started using it then, and it is still going strong. Unfortunately I cannot tell you how long it took to break (wear out) since it is still working like new. 5 stars!

$review_text.: I bought mine very very cheap somewhere else, figured if nothing else it would be a good mp3 player. The latest versions of java will not work on it and it cannot be updated. BUT there is a work-around available at the velocity micro cruz support website. Just click the "why does my browser crash" question and it explains how to disable java. Most websites will detect that java is disabled and serve up a trimmed down version. I own a website and our mobile version of our site does not use java.edit added. Amazon MP3 store locked mine up so totally I couldn't even turn it off (Twitter might have been running at the same time). So I did find the re-set button - tiny little hole on the top - poke something in it. I was looking for the battery thinking I'd remove it to re-set. Can't find any way to get to the battery and there are no screws on the case to open it.

$REVIEW.: I've had this LCD TV in my house for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the quality of the picture, size and design.  Best way to break this down into a short review would be to list the pros and cons:PROS: nice design; wonderful picture for HD signal and DVDs; sturdy stand; plenty of inputsCONS: remote control is terrible, shocks me that Panasonic would make such a nice television and then engineer a remote that is just awful; no PC inputBeing new to the new flat screen TVs I am a little ignorant of why/how analog signals fit this widescreen TV, but they do and the picture doesn't seem stretched at all.  All in all I am very happy with this television and don't miss my bulky cathode ray tube.  This TV is perfect for a bedroom, office or anywhere a smaller TV can be used.  The only major downside is the atrocious remote control that comes with it, but that's not enough to take this down another star.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

$review_text.: I bought this because it looked like the least expensive way to acquire foam for my camera backpack. (I have a special, compartmentalized backpack for my camera and research tools.  It's not a Pelican product.)The foam had no odor when I opened the packaging. That's a plus for me, because I hate plastic-y smells. Also, the foam cuts easily and is perfect for padding your camera, lenses, light meter, or other tools you're carrying.It's just firm enough.  It'll cushion my camera and other equipment if the backpack is jostled or even dropped, and the foam springs back to its original shape, immediately.I'm probably ordering a second foam set because this set wasn't quite enough for all the spaces in my backpack, but that's because I carry a lot of small devices for my field work.If you're looking for an affordable way to buy high-quality foam for padding delicate equipment in a backpack or luggage, this is an excellent choice.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect for padding camera backpacks

$review_text.: The ear speakers come with a collection of dome and double dome eartips.  While none of these geometrically perfect tips are a substitute for a professionally made earmold, the double dome design fits and holds better than the single dome does.  I plan to eventually get left and right custom earmolds for a better fit and seal.My hunch is that the bass response will improve with custom earmolds but with the stock tips I found it was not as strong as less expensive earbuds.  The overall sound quality, however was much better with a more linear response.  I found the best support for the ear speakers was to have the cable exit pointing up then wrap it behind my ear for better support.  These are heavy and the extra weight needs to be supported somehow.Overall they are the best pair of earbuds I own.  Stay away from the $13 china specials - they are very nonlinear in response.

$review_text.: Whilst I may have accidentally drunk ordered this wonderful piece of machinery, actually make that drunk ordered 3 so I'd have a complete set for eyefinity, it turned out to be absolutely amazing. The only gripe that I have is  that it is an amazing fingerprint for magnets compared to the Matte finished monitors I had prior. After realizing this is the only flaw, being that there are no dead pixels, there is great colour management built in, and that they fit nicely with a fairly small bezel I had decided to keep this drunk purchase. Only other con is that these are not VESA compatible so you can't order alternative mounts or stands. Not that the original ones are particularly bad, but it's a nightmare to make them all even and lined up nicely.

$review_text.: I record and release music on my own, and this preamp is crucial to my work.  Is it as good as a Daking or a Grace?  Of course not!  But it's also not $700; it's $30.If you're recording in your own studio or at home, then you're not recording in an ideal environment--and that's OK.  But in such a non-ideal environment, a premium mic and premium preamp is a waste of money, because you won't get any real improvement in sonic quality.This is where the ART comes in.  Here's how you should use it:1. Run your mic or instrument into the ART.2. Run the ART into your audio interface.3. CRUCIAL!  Set your interface at neutral gain---the point where the interface adds no gain and subtracts no gain.  Refer to your interface's manual.4. Arm your recording track in your DAW.5. Adjust the gain on the interface until you're getting a good signal in your DAW.  ALWAYS keep your interface at neutral gain!!!There you go.  With this protocol, you'll get no hum, no noise.  Your signal will be warm and clean.  Bear in mind, if you engage the Boost switch on the ART, you'll start getting noise, so be very careful.Studio setups aren't easy.  Even the priciest gear will give you an atrocious result if you're not good at what you're doing.

There is something inherently wrong with the design of the DAC in this unit. I can't listen to the sound from this item without damaging my hearing, or using such a low volume level, that its just not worth using the item.You're better off buying an apple 30 pin line out cable and skipping the idea of an ipod DAC.

$REVIEW.: I'd give this four stars only because one con that I have discovered was the earplug rubber covering that goes around the ear buds.  They have the tendency to become easily knocked off.  I lose one every other month.The great part about this is, that i use it for the gym, and outdoor running.  It can withstand excessive sweating, and still function properly.  Although the ear loop molding will lose is shape and form after awhile and still have to be adjusted during my run.I don't like how the plug is a  straight line/bar.  I think it could improve by having an &#34; L &#34; type connection.

$review_text.: I've got 4 iPhones and several iPods in the family. Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power.  Ever since I got the iTorch, that problem no longer exists. The iTorch is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a "worry-free" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the iTorch, both those problems is solved. The flashlight comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use.The one drawback to the iTorch is that everyone wants to use it.

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately two strikes.1). This card reader was "rejected" by Apple's iPad software for using too much power when I plugged it into the apple digital camera connection kit USB connection. (I fault Apple for this ridiculous limitation.) There are reviews on Amazon for this reader that say it works in the iPad, but unfortunately, it didn't work in MY iPad.However2). The unit was defective, as far as I can tell. Four pins bent as I gently pressed an 8GB compact flash card into the compact flash slot. I've used this  compact flash card in about a dozen readers and two cameras over a two year period.  I know how to insert a compact flash card, and I've never bent a pin in a compact flash reader.

$REVIEW.: The number one plus for me; these speakers have been sitting on my deck, rain, shine, snow for 3 years and still working great.-Great sound-Decent looks.  Simple style so it is easy to match with many landscape.-Reasonable price.  Outdoor speakers are generally expensive-Easy installation-Yoke is adjustable to direct the speakers at some anglesTip:  I think it will be a good idea to weatherproof the contacts of the speaker wires to the speaker connections with something like a silicon sealant. The connections got a little corroded due to the elements and I have to cut the tip of the wires to expose the new copper and reconnect.
$review_summary.: Great and dependable speakers.

$REVIEW.: Well, it worked right out of the box, as advertised. Hence the 3 stars.Why is the player going back? It has a laughable screen resolution letting the movie appear very pixelated. Not easy enough on the eyes to sit through a whole 1.5 hour flick. The on-screen "remote" is a joke, almost illegible. The buttons are a pain to operate, it needs quite some pressure to make them behave. For a 7" screen player I expected it to be less bulky (20cm x 16cm x 4cm, 682g (1.5 pound)) and the whole unit has a cheap plasticky feel to it, I do fear the kids will break it.
$SUMMARY.: Didn't like it.

$REVIEW.: The Canon D20 is a fun, rugged camera. Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that there are many cameras and makers that deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and find out what else is available for your specific need.The Canon D20 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and a x5 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CMOS-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 3200. That rating is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need that only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 1.9 frames per second- for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 228 grams.Canon D20 comes with GPS, it is waterproof to 33 feet of depth, freezeproof, and shockproof.Overall, a fun camera for the outdoors. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search. That will also tell you more about what you want.
$review_summary.: Fun, Rugged camera

$review_text.: First off it isn't as long a hood as it looks in the ad photo if I had to guess id say 1 1/2- 1 3/4 in.  Second if you don't push the hood on all the way securely it can leave small gaps where light can show through. The one thing that I really didn't like is the construction of the hood it seems like a cheaper plastic which is disappointing Polaroid usually puts out top quality products never the less if your a very active photographer moving a round a lot this is probably not the lens hood for you a small bump or jar against the hood is all it takes for it to pop off. It is a decent product for a photographer that would be using a tripod out in the open in a calm area.

$review_text.: I pre-ordered this for the Nov. 5, 2008 release date, and anxiously awaited its arrival.  I wanted it for its compactness and portability, and I am certainly not disappointed on either of those considerations.  This netbook is awesome for taking on an airplane or to the coffee shop.  The battery lasts about 4 hours, which is more than enough for my typical usage.  The keyboard is at 85% size, which I am able to adjust to without too much trouble.  I like that the mouse buttons are in the normal locations.  The biggest complaint about the keyboard is the apostrophe key being out of place.  Even after almost a year of constant usage, I still have to hunt for that key, and I am a better-than-average typist.  Every now and then it runs slowly because of memory size.  Those are my two complaints, BOTH of which I believe are resolved in the new Dell Mini 10.  A 92% keyboard with all the keys in the right place, and a 120 or 160 gig harddrive.  I wish I had waited, but at the same time I am very happy with this and use it almost exclusively.  I use it for word processing, email and internet, powerpoint presentations, photo editing, etc.  I am overall very happy with it, but think I would be happier still with the mini 10.

$REVIEW.: I have so many of those HUGE plugs at my computer
Between the Printer, Scanner, Hard Drives, and Cordless Phone among other things..

I would always have to unplug something to use something else! I had THREE of the regular 6-Outlet Strips but if I would plug in 2 of these enormous plugs, I wouldn't be able to access the other 4 outlets
What a waste of an entire strip!The swivels allow me to alternate them in such a way that I can plug in 2 BIG plugs and 2 SMALL plugs side-by-side!BIG, small, BIG, small..


and I don't lose a single outlet! If you play around with it, I'm sure you'll be able to position all your plugs in such a way that all the outlets get utilized! It's compact and I don't have that cobweb mess anymore under my desk when I had to use a million strips for my bulky plugs!

$review_text.: I would say everything positive everyone says is true about this back pack.Unfortunately, it scratched my laptop. There is a little mesh bag next to where the laptop goes with a metal zipper. The bag moved around in the car and scratched my laptop (aluminum laptop).I would put the laptop in a sleeve before putting it in the bag. But then why buy a bag designed for a laptop when you still have to take more steps to make sure it's protecting it.I've had this for more than a year (daily use) and it has no wear on it, It's really is well made. I don't intend to replace it now, but if something happened to it I would get a different bag (will try to get the same brand, just one with a different layout if possible, if not, I have to look again at different brands).

$REVIEW.: YEs, there are two mounts, this is the newer one

And it is a GoPro not some knockoff using their name

I tried locking it to the table and, well, no way
Too porous
It sticks to my laptop and the microwave, so now I can do screen captures and watch my food cook
As for the car (the purpose of it) it sticks to the outside just fine
Some plastics inside work but for the most part a crinkle finish will mean a short stick-time with this unit

 Even making it wet did not make it stick

However they do say use a flat surface without curves or even stickers

It is not for use on surfboards or other high activity motion.I give it four stars because as this is the new model it is very compact, and therefore using the screw tp out the camera into place is a tight fit
I can't manage that with gloves, it is fingers only and then I can only reach 270 degrees of the knob as the camera is in the way


I'd have appreciated a longer mounting screw.Even if the unit cannot stick to the surface, it is weighted enough so that the camera can sit upright and the suction cup mount can be a stand like a tripod


So it will serve several purposes

 I like the extra accessories so I can have a tilt army or not


I worried that sionce this one was $10 less than the other it was the older one, and it turned out to be the new one
Yay.

$review_text.: Creative has produced an inexpensive set of 2 speakers with subwoofer to use with your computer.  Of course, when it comes to audio, the more you pay for speakers the higher the quality.  But how many of us want to pay $1000 for top-end speakers for our computers.  If you want something that is much, much better than any built in speakers, has a volume control, and produces reasonable sound, these speakers deliver. For background music, podcasts, or streaming media, the Creative Inspire system delivers.  One important thing to note is to think about the wire placement.  The subwoofer plugs into the audio out on your computer, and the 2 desktop speakers, then plug into the subwoofer.  So placement will be important.  The wires are a decent length, 8 feet, but not super long.

$REVIEW.: First, for it's price this is a pretty decent tablet. However, price is not all that matters with these things and it really depends on what you use it for and overall quality.I don't regret the purchase, but people who are used to consumer ready products and don't like to hack, figure things out, etc should stick with Galaxy or iPad.Advantages:- Great price- Solid qualityDisadvantage:- Lack of accessories. Even basic ones such as USB OTG or HDMI connector.- Touchscreen sometimes has trouble with pattern unlock (this may be more my product or my fingers though)- Lacks back camera (I didn't think this would be a problem, but it's something I would like to see). I knew this buying it though and it's negated with the price.General:This is very well built. I'm pleased with the way it feels and it works as I expected (if you have an android phone, it's basically a big giant phone). I had no problems installing Android Applications. Any disadvantages with the software are inherent with the software and not with the tablet.The manufacturer's website is very sparse with information. If you want any significant information you have to search for it and find what others have to say about it.Performance:I use it mostly for PDF reading. It's pretty slow for large files on any number of reading devices. However, it displays small files very well. I use it for double column journal articles and it's big enough (for me) to read it in "fit screen mode." This is true of both Adobe Reader, Aldiko, and one other reader I forgot the name of and have since uninstalled.I installed an unofficial version of VLC player (noneon version) and it works great. No complaints there.Software:It's pretty bare... but that's how I like it. Unlike my Samsung Epic 4G, it's not filled with bloatware and I can install many of them.This is a big plus for me and I've installed all the applications I normally like without any bugs.Applications (known) that I use that work great: Google Voice, Skype, Kindle Reader, Aldiko, Facebook, Firefox, eBay, VLC, Tivo, Wikipedia.The Adobe Reader does strange things when you change stretch/zoom in view settings. For me, if I change it while reading a PDF it escapes out and goes back to the main adobe file selection screen. This may be software though.Networking:It doesn't accept ad hoc connection (unless you root it). I found out this is common to most mobile devices not just Le Pan. The device doesn't seem to have a problem finding my network at home but it does seem to have a hard time finding new networks when I go to Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, etc (or other restaurant with free Wifi). It's not a huge problem, but it takes a while to find new networks.Bluetooth is slow... It's slower transferring files than my Samsung Epic 4G and a Treo. However, I don't do much with Bluetooth anyway and the mouse I installed works fine and was easy to install.Accessories:Horrible support. This is a relatively new product and it's not from one of the big manufacturers, but it misses some of the basic accessories that they should have made pre-launch. I can say this because I'm an electrical engineer and I've checked their the circuit diagram they submitted to FCC,... there should be no reason they shouldn't have had their HDMI adapter ready at launch.Does not have a 30-pin connector to USB connector. I would have liked to see them come outAlso, regarding accessories, they are difficult to find. You have to send an e-mail to customer support and pay $10 shipping to receive a cable.Their products aren't compatible with any other tablet device. Some iPod chargers work if you shave a piece of plastic off though.Summary:Overall, if you can do without the HDMI or connecting to external USB devices this is an excellent product. The company promises to bring these out, but many new companies break promises. With the Le Pan TC970, they said it would be upgradeable to Honeycomb and now they say it will not be available.

$review_text.: So this was my replacement card after I purchased a GeForce GTX 550 Ti and had major heat issues with it.I couldn't afford to bump up to a higher card as I was tight on money as it is, so this card not only managed to replace my original card but it gave me a noticeable (albeit subtle) improvement in performance over the GTX 550 Ti and without any of the heat issues. Being an EVGA is what really sweetens the deal here however. The build of the card is incredibly solid and makes you feel like you just purchased a premium piece of hardware. The little &#34;Powered by EVGA&#34; sticker just reassures you that.So if anyone's looking for a mid-ranged graphics card for a very good price made by a very solid manufacturer, this is a great choice.A list of some games I play without any problems:DishonoredCivilization VSkyrimDark SoulsAssassins CreedGuild Wars 2Unreal Tournament 3Crysis 2The Witcher 2PlanetSide 2

$review_text.: I bought this for a stock HP desktop that I bought refurbished that has on-board (built in) graphics, which was the main negative about it that I wanted to change.  It also has a quad core CPU and 8GB of RAM...cheap RAM, but 8GB nonetheless. The power supply is only 350 watts. Keep in mind that overall it is a pretty wimpy system, particularly compared to a gaming system I recently built myself, but I mainly bought it for my kids to use for homework and to play some of their games off of.It had one open PCI-E slot, into which I dropped this card.  The card requires no power hook-up, but instead draws its power from the motherboard.  My computer recognized it right away (Vista 64-bit Home Edition) and switched over automatically from its on-board graphics to this card. (I had to restart it once for it to find it) If this does not happen for your particular machine, the instructions tell you how to re-configure the BIOS to rectify the situation.Right now I only have it hooked up to the VGA port due to the lack of a cable.  It also has a DVI port, which I will soon use, and an HDMI port.  It comes with software for drivers (it installs two if you so desire, one for graphics and one for 3-D gaming) and also a VGA to DVI converter. It also comes with low-profile mounting brackets if required.  The instructions are very straight-forward if you need them, plus they supply the web address for a support website and a number to call 24/7 should you need assistance (I've tried neither).Now that the card has been installed on my refurbished desktop, all activities on my screen are noticeably faster.  So, for the money and for what I needed, I'm very pleased.  This is one of the few relatively low-cost cards I found that had 1GB of memory and also had an HDMI port to boot.  At present my monitor only has a DVI and a VGA port for hookup, but I like having the HDMI option in case I upgrade the monitor later.  In summary, I've found this card to be a good value for what you get and I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I bought several of these, to connect to the back of the amplifier cabinet, and the PC in a cabinet that I connect to my HDTV. The main purpose was to provide more air cooling given these generate a lot of heat and the cutout at the back of the cabinets is not big enough to allow the heat to escape fast enough. Simply connected the fan to the USB port of my PC and amp respectively, and suddenly they have gone from being almost too hot to touch, to now barely warm. Excellent device and a lifesaver for my expensive equipment.

$REVIEW.: So it is not as thin as the MS Surface membrane keyboard, but the keyboard itself has a sold feel and is responsive. I found that you do have to be careful about hitting the shift key though still easier than trying to type on the screen. The unit lacks a bottom lock, so if you are used to a laptop and flip the iPad farther than 90 degrees the top will have a tendency to continue backwards.  Also the unit does not snap or lock to the base near the keyboard. All in all it is a good unit, just a little wobbly.

$REVIEW.: This PSU is awesome. Powers my overclocked FX 8350(5.2Ghz) and Radeon HD 7950(1350Mhz) with ease. This product is quiet and performs extremely well. I've always been a fan of modular PSU's and the same holds true for this product. the box came with a storage pouch for all extra cables you don't use. The only con I have with this PSU is that when you shutdown, this power supply says running for probably a minute or so after all other components have stopped running. It't not a bid deal, I just find it strange.Overall, I would recommend this product for anyone who needs a good quality, reliable RED led power supply.

$REVIEW.: The tripod arrived from the factory with the pan-head locked into place, due to an over-tightened bolt.  It took 3 hours to get it repaired, and it still did not function correctly afterwards.  The up/down motion is very fluid, but the panning motion is not a true fluid head (I could use my body to create a smoother pan).  It completely ruined an entire weekend of videography, and I am sending it back.  The price was too good to be true.Update:  Get the AVTP version instead.  It is 5x the quality, for only a few dollars more!  I love it.

$REVIEW.: This box has been great.  It provides much better clarity (HD) than our blu-ray disc player that it replaced (for NetFlix access).  I think it will also be better maintained (with access and software updates) than the blu-ray player.  Very simple and intuitive remote as well (how did we end up with the monstrosities that the standard tv/dvd/blu-ray player has !?!).  I would like one of these for each of my tvs (including the 'smart' ones).

$REVIEW.: Holy smokes I am happy with this set! My first computer speakers were the Boston Acoustics BA635's.  I had them for many years and was very pleased with those. I had to sacrifice them so my parents could have decent sound for their LCD tv. I then purchased a used set of Dell Zylux A525's. The Dells were not too shabby. The Bostons were better. I had those for about 3 years and decided it was time for an upgrade.I love doing any kind of research on the internet so I was happy to do some shopping research. I searched fanaticly for about a week and had a spending limit of $250. I do buy used but I prefer new, naturally. The Logitech Speaker System Z623 seemed an obvious choice because it had great ratings and a modest price but I kept reading reviews comparing it to the Z-2300 saying that the Z623 was good, but nowhere near as good as the Z-2300. So I researched the Z-2300. I read reviews on tech sites and tech forums calling the Z-2300's the &#34;last of the titans&#34; and such. These days manufacturers have been skimping on quality and performance because of the economy, I know this, so I decided to buy these speakers.I have a pretty nice home theater setup with a Def Tech SC-4000 sub which shakes the foundation. The sub in this set is almost as good! It's not earth shaking but it is wall shaking and it hits those low lows with ease. It weighs about 35 lbs and is full of power! Now let's be honest about the L/R speakers. They are ok, but really, have you ever heard little speakers that had full range? Ok maybe you have. I have some Bowers & Wilkins M1's and those sound fantastic but they also cost $250 per speaker. That's $90 more than I paid for this entire set! The good news is that if you ever wanted to replace these speakers with some M1's, you could. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the range of the L/R speakers when they are absolutely fine and do the job right. With a little tuning of your computer's sound and your playback software, you can achieve pleasing sounds.I really like the controller because you can power the system on/off, control the volume and the volume of the sub separately.I was really fortunate to find this on Amazon for a reasonable price, in mint condition from an excellent seller. I highly recommend this 2.1 set. It probably is indeed the last of the titans.

$review_text.: For its cost, the manufacturer should better secure the bolt caps that easily fall off. An otherwise insignificant problem for a well functioning tripod (after 10 months of use), the price of this carbon-light equipment is largely justified by pride of ownership rather than extra functionality or weight saving. Unless you have an emotional relationship with your photographic equipment or you really need to save a few ounces (mountain climbing for example), the cost of this tripod does not justify its superiority to comparable products.

$review_text.: I purchased two of these for my husband's laptop and my PC. I love the convenience of not having unsightly, cumbersome wires of the conventional mouse.  The size is comfortable for both our hands.  Although, I've used it briefly while trying out my husband's new laptop, I haven't opened mine and am basing this review on my husband's experience of 6 weeks.  He likes to surf the net in the comfort of the bedroom and oft times, the bed, and finds that the mouse easily glides over practically all types of surfaces. The mouse is still going strong after daily use without having to change the batteries. This is an excellent size for any computer or laptop user. The wireless receiver stores handily underneath the mouse and reminds me that I need to turn the power switch off after use.  We're very happy with these purchases and feel it's an excellent mouse at a great price.The only con for me is that the scroll wheel is free-rolling and I prefer the clickable ones where I can control the amount of scrolling with each click. That is not a problem, though, as it is a matter of preference.  This is highly recommended in my book.

$REVIEW.: Pros: Clear Screen, No dead pixels on my two units, Good Color, Weird front of screen is actually part of a well-designed and very solid integrated base which I like now that I've used it, I use it in PC mode, although I have made specific adjusts to it.  The screen turns itself off automatically to conserve power if no signal is received- a good feature.Cons:  DO NOT PAY $400 or $500!!!!  Its great, but not that great.  Instead, save your pennies for a big 1080p.  I will note that one monitor must have slightly different color adjustments to match color tones and hues, therefore uniformity of production quality may be an issue.  Still, both monitors are great.

$REVIEW.: first of all, the range on this thing is pretty amazing. i use it hooked up to my 50 inch tv for video mostly. i can be sitting at our island in the kitchen 30 feet away and use it to browse pictures with family and friends. i primarily just sit on my couch that's like 6 ft away, but still i was impressed at it's range.the weight and size are perfect. it's small enough to tuck it away almost anywhere, yet big enough to be able to type and scroll around. i debated getting one of those joystick mouses that are very small but if you're going to use it to type emails or even type in web addresses i think this keyboard is for you. love it.i did previously have a logitech wireless mouse and keyboard (separate components). the range wasn't great on that one and it did die eventually (hence this purchase). it took about 3 years to die, but regardless i was a little wary to buy a logitech.i've only had it for about a week, but i'm absolutely loving it so far.

$review_text.: I've never owned a Roku.  Do have an Apple TV as well as a chromecast.  I do see the hype about Roku though!  Tons of channels, really lots of options and almost impossible to sample it all!  The price point is right for sure!  For $15 over a chromecast, you get a handy remote that really makes the whole experience that much better.  It streams very well.  The dual band aspect to the wifi really shines!  I've had this for 3 weeks now and I've only buffered a Netflix video once!  The only minor downside (my 4 star rating vs 5) is the interface is a bit slow.  Button presses on the remote take a second to register, and some apps (namely Netflix) take 2+ minutes to load up!  I've read the hardware capability is about on par with the Roku 1, not the newer 3 that apparently flies.  Altogether though, this is a purchase I'm thrilled with.  Hides behind my wall mounted TV perfectly, and once you get going, streams content extremely well!  I recommend!

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a new radio to put into my truck and I couldn't decide which one was the "Right" one. Over whelmed with choices i went to my friend and he bought this model (for a lot more from retail). I decided to go with this one and installed it personally within a couple of hours. It looks great, sounds great, and feels great (not to get too creepy or anything). I like the scan feature which lets the LED Display change colors, you can also keep it to one single color. I also like the pandora feature, and USB and AUX inputs. The design is sleek. Lights up bright in the night as-well. I'm not sure about how it would sound with amps or extra speaks as i do not have any installed yet, but with stock speakers and windows down cruising down the high way it sounds perfect. If i could make one suggestions is to install in the day, i installed this in the night because i could not wait and so i lost a screw for the truck while putting it back and i killed my battery having the door light on. My fault.

That was completely unnecessary. At my height (5'11) this stand is more than high enough to read comfortably while standing up. Also, the extra extension takes a bit of effort to add/remove (requires screwing/unscrewing the thickest tube at the base) since it has no telescoping abilities.Other thoughts: it'd be neat if I could easily hot swap my Kindle Paperwhite with my Nexus 10, but the different sizes of these devices make this a bit of a challenge (only 4 small elastic cords to hold device corners provided with this product). At the moment I'm just using the Kindle app. On the other hand, Amazon does sell 1mm round elastic cords... heh. Added to cart.

$review_text.: I have an Ipod Classic 6th Generation 80 Gb.Conecting it to the ipod and pressing the button, it immediatly begins to search an earphone (In discovery mode). After connected, the sound is crispy, clear and the controls (Play, pause, foward, back) are excelent.Excelent option if you don't like to deal with cables and a limited range of motion.The sight range is awersome, i tested it and it's connected with an excelent sound quality on a 20 mts. range.The only bad thing is it drains a bit faster the ipod battery, it only last on my ipod maximum 8 continous hours. When using it with a cord earphone, last more than 16 hours.If you have an ipod touch (From the 2nd generation) or an iphone, is useless buying this.

$REVIEW.: The Zoo-Tunes Portable Mini Character Speaker is cute and gets noticed by folks - my tweens and teens and their friends, all liked it.PRO: When hooked up to our smartphones it gives them a nice "boombox" effect and when you unplug it you hear a considerable difference in the playback from the phone speaker system on its own.CON: However, when used with our laptops, most of which fall into a moderate price range, there is no noticeable difference in the sound.  You can hear the sound playing through the speaker when you listen to it up-close but it doesn't add to or amplify the sound system in these laptops and there is no noticeable difference in the playback when you unplug the speaker. If you had a truly awful sound system, it might make a difference but not in the ones we have and we didn't buy laptops with tremendous sound systems to start with.POSSIBLE CON: The phone does not come with the needed USB cord so we used it with the 3 triple A batteries instead and they worked well.  This is not a huge issue for us as the speaker is for occassional use, not regular play, but the price of the cord and the need to secure one separately, should enter into your consideration if you are going to use this speaker daily.

$REVIEW.: Well in short, I think this is a great tablet.  If you've used netbooks in the past, then you already know not to expect them to perform like laptops, however, after a few modifications, my s10-3t is running great.  You definitely need to upgrade to a version of windows beyond starter such as home premium or pro.  I used ultimate since I had an extra key.  The touch mechanisms in Windows 7 home  and up are way better than the jerky slow lenovo stuff.  Then you need to uninstall most of the junkware that comes with the lenovo like onetouch and stuff.  make sure to keep the touch drivers though.  I forgot what it's called but there's an icon in the system tray that'll tell you what that program is not to uninstall. Next you need to follow some of the tips presented here for optimizing windows 7 for a netbook.  This is only for later editions and not the starter edition that comes with the netbook.[...].After I did all this ,my touch experience is much more like my Nexus one phone, very responsive and acts how I imagined.  I think it was just a bad idea to use windows 7 starter on this netbook as Lenovo had to implement a lot of their own touch software(Which is slow and jerky) since Starter edition doesn't come with the real microsoft designed windows multitouch stuff.  So upgrade, you'll be much happier.  Windows 7 is surprisingly well enabled for multitouch.If you are a firefox user, I also suggest this[...]I needed a stylus so I ordered an HTC stylus which is a lot like the DAGI capacitive touch styli.  They are much firmer and have a much finer point on them then those pogo styli and others. HTC st c400Once you get rid of most(but not all) of the lenovo stuff and upgrade windows and follow some of the tuning tips in this review, I think you'll be pretty happy with your purchase.  Now I sit and read on the couch all the time and watch internet tv. A touch screen makes a huge difference in comfort when sitting around in awkward positions or reading in darkness when you can't see your regular keyboard.  The onscreen keyboard in upgraded versions of windows 7 is multitouch enabled and is super responsive on this thing.Oh, and the auto rotation works much better in upgraded versions of windows 7.  it's accurate and quick like a phone.And if you can afford it, go ahead and get another 1gb of memory.A little background: I use this for business and I travel a great deal.  I've had other netbooks like the acer 532h (which was also great for the price but no touchscreen)

$review_text.: They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive

I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help
Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760
I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work
The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it

The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal

I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints
I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great
This one must have been defective.

$review_text.: I've owned this QNAP product for a year now


 I'm using it with 2x 2TB WD RED's as single disks
 Everything you read about QNAP's quality and hardware is true


 When comparing QNAP (side by side) to it's competitors (like models) QNAP units typically have more powerful processors and more installed memory
 Do QNAP devices often cost a little more.

 Yes.You do however get what you pay for
 Some of this is in quality, but the majority is in performance and features

 Clock speed and memory is everything in a NAS

 Managing large amounts of data can be time consuming
 Doing it on a underpowered NAS is downright painful


 The other thing QNAP often has over the competition are features


 SATA hotswap capability, USB 3.0 and eSATA
 You don't always find these on competitor's units at the same price point.Software is the second most important component
 QNAP loses a few stars here

 Development is not bleeding edge
 Releases take longer and the wait between releases has been long from time to time


 Overall I am very pleased with the power and performance of my NAS
 Having owned several consumer grade NAS products, The QNAP's performance is much better and worth the additional cost IMO.If the operating system was updated more frequently and updated with the latest versions of packages available, it would be a 4-5 star product


 From a hardware and feature standpoint, it's extremely hard to beat.Update **This product performs very well with QTS 4.0.2 which was released late July

 Reliability and stability remain high.Update2*** This past year I have had the opportunity to work with both QNAP and Synology devices side by side

 The user experience is almost identical except for the following


 The QNAP boxes are generally more powerful

 Faster set up and shorter RAID creation times.

$review_text.: This case and keyboard both are great quality. the only problem is that after propping the ipad up it stands too close to the keyboard. also as the other reviewers mentioned the right shift key is smaller than the normal size so it a little difficult for those people who are touch typing. the biggest gripe that i have with this keyboard is that the arrow keys cannot be used in the web browser to scrool up and down. I got it in a lightning deal so overall for the price that i paid i think it is a really great deal.

$REVIEW.: This was purchased for a young child to do school work.  As a 4th grader, some work needs to be typed and assignments are online based.  This can be inconvenient when you have 1 pc and 3 people trying to use it.  A reasonably priced notebook (around $250) that was portable seemed like a great option.  This Dell Inspiron Mini Netbook is a good choice for our young son but I would not recommend it for heavy use.The small size of this Netbook makes it super portable which is nice.  I was a little concerned over the keyboard due to the smaller size but it proved easy to use, even for adults.  The touchpad was fine.  The speakers are pretty good and the battery life is okay (5-7 hours).  The screen is 10.1" and did not feel as small as I thought it would.  Viewing online videos (Hulu) can be difficult and the resolution could be better.  Also, the Netbook heats up enough to make it uncomfortable to touch parts of the keybord after viewing for a while.  It comes with Windows 7 Starter pre-installed which provides the basics only.  There is no Media Center or dvd playback. My biggest gripe is that this netbook can be sloooow.I would not be happy if this Netbook was for my personal use but it meets the requirements for a child in elementary school and the price was right.  If you are looking for a cheap Netbook for light use, this one is a good choice.

The computer has a core2 Quad intel processor and 4g ram, so it should have worked just fine, but apparently our old 512mb video card was the culprit.

$review_text.: Excellent performance, however, it is not at all on par with my true solid state drives in my MacBook laptops


 I am currently using this hybrid drive as a second storage drive for my iMac

 It's still an excellent drive for the price with oustanding performance-- just not in the same league as a true solid state drive

 Over time, it will [supposively] adapt to your computing habits by storing the most frequently accessed data in the small solid state component


 For most casual users, I can see this being a viable and economical alternative to a full-fledged solid state drive

 But, if you are a power user, as you already know, boot speeds probably won't be impacted dramatically
 I still rate the drive a solid &#34;B+&#34; - it has been running strong for months with heavy usage


 I am very impressed with Seagate's products overall.

Otherwise you are going to have slow, spotty, unreliable at best. Bad ping (3000ms+ is not uncommon), flat out dropping ssh sessions etc (hope you use screen).

$review_text.: The Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse is an aesthetically pleasing mouse optimized for Windows 8, and is advertised as working with most tablets and laptops.  I was quickly able to pair the mouse with my Windows 7 laptop and download the software from the Microsoft Device Center, which allowed me to customize the settings and do things like assign mouse buttons to do different things in different programs. The whole setup process was quick and intuitive.I tried to mouse on several surfaces, including a wood table and a granite kitchen counter.  The mouse, which is powered by a AA battery, worked flawlessly on either surface. I did not try it on a carpet, but Microsoft says it will work on that surface as well.  The mouse only has two buttons, on the underside of the device, for power and to open the battery door.My only complaint is the size of the mouse. Microsoft advertises the fact that the Wedge Touch has a "compact design for ultimate portability." This mouse is a bit on the small side for my hands. When using it, I find that I "grip" the mouse using my thumb and ring finger, and that my index and middle finger do all of the clicking. Using the mouse for hours may be stressful on my fingers because the smaller size forces me to cup my hand more tightly around the device.Bottom line, I like the Wedge Touch Mouse. It looks different than a standard mouse and I appreciate the fact that Microsoft is trying to produce a compact mouse that travels easily, If you have large hands, however, you may find it uncomfortable or difficult to use.

Skipping caused drawn lines to appear left/right//top/bottom of actual stylus center point. I read a reviewer who mentioned putting thermal paste, and I might have to do that. Screen scratch!!! Thank goodness I put on screen protectors on BOTH my tablets... I noticed the Jot Pro left a scratch (on the screen protector) on my Nexus 7. Kind of disappointed... but what's done is done and I have 2 more screen protectors to redo this with... Although, not too much of an obstruction as the glass screen is unharmed.

It also makes traveling easy as it is small so it fits in almost anything from a briefcase, suitcase or even a large purse. It also has a built in stand which makes it easier to use since you no longer need to hold your playbook the entire time.

The Vapor-X cooling system is fantastic, this thing stays &#60;60 C under 100% load 24/7 mining crypto currencies.Thankful I was able to get one from Amazon at MSRP since all the other vendors **COUGH NEWEGG COUGH** are jacking their prices up by twice the cost.Easily overclockable, very stable, quiet fans, low temps.

$review_text.: Just installed 2 Yamaha in-wall 960 speakers and realized that my outdated Infinity center channel was no longer a good match.  The Yamahas have dual 6.5s so I needed to step up from the 4-inch drivers on the Infinity and started searching.  I found that most LCRs in the sub-$300 range had anything from 3.5-inch to 5.25-inch woofers;  I had recently added a BIC sub to my system so I checked their website and saw the FH6 that sports dual 6.5s as well as the horn tweeter, which would be a nice match with my Yammys.  Unfortunately, I didn't want to spend the $329 price tag so I checked Amazon and found a listing for $107.  Are you kidding me?!?  Took me all of 2 seconds to order one.If you are looking for some sleek, updated look and an elaborate company logo, do not purchase this speaker.  BUT if you are wanting to get a huge bang for your buck with a powerful center channel, I don't think you can do any better than the FH6.  It can handle a range down to 40Hz (most other centers I saw were in the 50-65 range), sports 175 watts, and the performance of the horn tweeter vs. the dome is evident on the dialogue signals of 5.1 dvds.  It's not a bass reflex design but rather a suspension (meaning there are no ports on the enclosure) so that gives you nice flexibility when positioning the speaker - you can hang it if you want and not worry about compromising any rear ports.  Just to break this speaker in, I set my receiver to all-channel stereo and let me tell you, this speaker is very capable of serving as a left or right channel as well.  Played some live Allman Brothers and some live Dave Matthews and it produced a nice crisp, warm stage which I'm sure will only get better as they loosen up;  the highs are clean but not overly bright, and the woofers play low enough bass frequencies to blend in very nicely with the sub without having to set the crossover too high.  The FH6 is virtually the same speaker as  BIC's top-of-the-line Acoustec Series minus the lacquer finish.Great buy, whether you get one for a center or three for a matched front line on your home theater.  BIC doesn't advertise or have a catchy slogan, but they do build very solid and powerful speakers that will not break your wallet...

$review_text.: This is a great option when looking into long stop neutral density filter. The variable neutral density filters are great but expensive. A 77mm variable ND filter of decent quality would be something like Tiffen, which is about $150. The other fixed ND filter options are the B&W 3.0 filter which gives you 10 stops and goes for $100ish and ofcourse the Lee Big Stopper which goes for around $200-250 for the kit, but also provides up to 10 stops of light restriction. This Hoya, offer 9 stops which is great and for $70 is a great option. I recently used it at Niagara Falls and was more than happy with the results. Professional grade construction. My only issue, which knocks off 1 star from my rating would be cleaning the damn thing. At Niagara I got some small water droplets on the filter, which did not affect the images at all, but when I got home and attempted to clean it, I noticed that no matter what I tried, that I could not get it looking like it did fresh out the package. I have read reviews on it and apparently this problem is something that a lot of people complain about. The pictures still come out great despite note being 100% clean, but like most of us photographers that like to keep things 100% clean, it sort of annoying. Overall a great item and I would highly recommend it if you want a high stop light reducing ND filter for the price.
$SUMMARY.: A great option!!

$review_text.: I read the multiple negative reviews. The product is thin, flexible, light weight. However, it is advertised as a &#34;Travel Cover.&#34;I have a heavier cover for daily use. It is thicker, has the magnet, and provides a lot of protection with the added benefit of allowing me to support the tablet in many positions.What this item does is allow for screen protection with minimum weight and effect on the tablet. It is thin, lightweight, and protects the screen. When I travel it allows me to slip the table in my pocket without any added bulk. With the other protector, it is much thicker and does provide a larger &#34;footprint&#34; during use.For my  Samsung S3 I have two covers. One that is for daily use. Plus, a very thin,, minimum protection for putting in a suit pocket.So, for a tablet I have a high protection cover and this one for travel.It is not the cover I would get for all uses. However, for what I needed, it is fine.So, if looking for something to protect the screen, minimal weight and added bulk. this is it.If you want something to allow you to prop up the tablet for reading and more screen protection, try the-Blason The New Nexus 7 2 FHD (2nd Generation) Auto Wake / Sleep [Slim Book] Stand Case CoverMy significant negative is why they couldn't have put a simple magnet for auto wake/sleep.

$REVIEW.: V2 of the eye-fi should be really great, if they allow you to add hotspots on the fly.I bought this for my wife because she loves to take pictures and put them on flickr, mostly snapshots of friends, family, and the cool things we see in our city. When she gets home and puts the camera (Casio Exilim Z80) on play, all the photos upload to her page and she begins to caption them on-line.If I need to add another wifi hotspot, though, I can only do it through a computer and only with the card in it's USB adapter. That is, I cannot do it remotely.All in all, a great idea, with current work-arounds, but still needs some more remote wifi features to make it a must-have.EDIT 2013: There is now an iPhone app that is really great with this thing, plus they have continually updated the card for free, so their post-purchase support is nothing short of amazing for a modern product.

I contacted amazon right away and they sent out a replacement TV close to immediately and sent UPS to pick the 1st damaged one up free of charge!  Needless to say when the second TV came (only 2 days later) I was very nervous.  WOW - what a nice TV for the price!  It has a great pictue and was very easy to set up.  So far I am loving it!  The only flaw I could find was the base that you put the TV on - when the TV is attached to the base with the little &#34;pole&#34; it is wobbly but seems to be fine.  I have no regrets about this purchase.

$review_text.: For the relatively small price tag, this flash drive is more than adequate for storing files/photos/music/videos. Transferring just over 6GB of data took required less than 15 minutes and the transfer speeds fluctuated between 10MBs and 30MBs, which is respectable.I appreciate the cover which helps to minimize any dust or particulates from accumulating on the adapter, but I'm worried that it might loosen over time or with extended capping/uncapping. Only time will tell on that front, however, and I'll update this review if there are any changes adverse or otherwise.

It only took me a minute to carefully grind off around 1/8&#34; high completely around the plastic and 1/16&#34; deep.  Obviously, be careful not to touch the metal connector.  It's an easy job.

$review_text.: Plays music very nicely and installation easy enough that anyone should be able to set it up. I'd recommend it to anyone that doesn't care if they could be heard from down the block, but just want to listen to their music or talk radio at a comfortable volume. They're loud enough to do that.One thing I didn't like was the clips on the wires that attach to the speakers and tweeters. The male connection has a dimple and female connection has a hole so the dimple rests on. When connecting them they are very easy to deal with but if for any reason you have to disconnect them, they will put up a mean fight on you that I guarantee you'll be left sweating and annoyed. The problem lies with that small dimple and hole. Once they're connected it is difficult to pull them apart. I had to carefully slip a box cutter blade to make room to then slip in a tiny flat head screwdriver to pry open those darn clips so they can be disconnected. Then I had to close back the clips with a pair of needle nose pliers. I did minor damage but once the dimple goes back in its hole it will stay on securely. I'm sure there are easier ways to deal with this but when I was working on them I had no access or time for internet searches so I did what I could. Other then this the speakers sound and look great.

$REVIEW.: Compared to the market it is not such a bad product, I guess


But these styli have NO precision

I want to use my iPad Mini to take notes, but this stylus is not precise enough to write small letters legibly
I don't think other styli do much better

The ones that do have some MAJOR drawbacks as well.I don't see a reason to use this over my fingers in any instance (which are also kind of imprecise and awkward to write with).At least this product looks nice, though? But it is something to carry around.The thing that lets you stick it into the headphone port is gimmicky and not too useful in practice

What if I want to listen to music on the go? The cap (or the whole pen when it is stored) just dangles around when you are actually using the iPad


I'd rather the cap just really secure onto the back of the pen as an extension so it is more comfortable to use while writing.I expect a bit more from Spigen products, to be honest.

$review_text.: I'm a wedding photographer, so I need a card case that can hold plenty of cards, and is something I can strap to my body to minimize the possibility of loss.  There is absolutely NO excuse for not having your cards on you at all times as a wedding shooter.  I've heard horror stories of card cases falling out of luggage, being stolen with gear bags, etc.  That's why you strap them on you.  You can replace gear. You can't replace once in a lifetime images.This case is easy to use and makes card management a breeze.  I put fresh cards facing up, and used cards I flip around so I can tell at a glance how many cards I've burned through and which ones I have left.  The little strap that comes with it can be hooked to a belt loop.  (The plastic fastener on the strap isn't the best, I suggest upgrading it by switching to a carabiner.)My partner swore by using the CF card holders in his lens bag until he tried my pixel pocket out, and then he wouldn't return it to me!  So now we have two.  The other thing I love is the business card holder.  Shooting events, I don't really have time to return to my camera bag to give a card out if someone asks for one.  It's nice to just have a few on me at all times.I do have two issues with it that keep me from giving it 5 stars.  The velcro is LOUD, especially if you are trying to discretely switch cards in a church during a ceremony.  I have to remember to take an extra card out ahead of time and keep it loose in my pocket, which I don't like doing.  I would LOVE an option with a silent fastener.Secondly, when fully loaded to capacity with CF cards and a small pinch of, say, five business cards - it barely closes.  I wish it was just a little bit roomier, because I almost always have it filled to capacity. It will close, but it's a tight fit.Less important, but I wish there were more colors available.  We'd probably buy an assortment of these in different colors to manage cards.  We own a LOT of cards, so we can do 2 or 3 days of back-to-back weddings and not have to dump cards.  It would be great to load up 3 pixel pockets in different colors and just be able to quickly grab and go and know which is which.

$review_text.: One of the things I really like about this product is that it has a slot for a wired ethernet cord
 My wifi is a bit unreliable, and there is nothing worse than listening to music that cuts out 20 times per minute
The wired ethernet jack solves this problem for me.

$REVIEW.: My daughter saw a video of these speakers and quickly became obsessed with getting a pair. The first set arrived with a crack in one of the speakers, causing all the water to leak out. Returned those and promptly received a new pair in good working order. The sound quality is what you would expect from a pair of gimmick speakers: poor. However, they do look cool, if the lights are off, and my daughter is pretty pleased with them. Not for audiophiles, which may be obvious, but they are good, cheap fun, particularly for kids. My daughter has had hers for three months now, since Christmas, and so far they are still going.

$REVIEW.: The product description states it's compatible with a wireless G router. Well, it didn't work for me. I have been working in I.T> for over 10 years so I am qualified to set up a router. In fact, anyone should be able to set up this router based on how it's supposed to work. You are supposed to be able to insert the install CD, plug in the Extender and follow the prompts of the installer. Not only wouldn't the extender install, it caused my PCs to keep dropping the connections. I spent WAY to much time on this. After a couple hours I decided to pack it in and send it back. Amazon was great in the return process. No hassle. Quick refund. The return process was the best part of the experience. In my humble opinion, I don't think that this product is compatible with a "G" router.

$REVIEW.: Initially, I was going to save $10 & buy the Anker Ultra Slim Mini Bluetooth Keyboard for $19.99 instead of this AmazonBasics bluetooth keyboard


 However, I changed my mind when I saw in the product description (towards the bottom) of the Anker, the warning "Limited compatibility with iOS 7 affecting the Cap Locks indicator light and the Search and Photo View Mode hot keys."  I didn't want to risk any other issues with getting an Anker and so bought the AmazonBasics.VERY HAPPY with the AmazonBasics keyboard
 It's very light and thin


 I followed the easy directions to connect to my iPad Mini and it detected/connected in less than 10 seconds

 I did some brisk typing and there wasn't any noticeable lag
 Others have said they had to reboot their iPads on iOS 7 before it would detect/connect to the keyboard, but I didn't need to do that.The only thing stopping this product from getting a 5 STARS rating are: (1) wish it were a little more sturdy (use thicker plastic maybe?) - I'm afraid without a sturdy case, it may be damaged/cracked in a backpack, and (2) the free "travel stand" included looks better than it actually works in reality - the angle is horrible - the iPad that you put in it is at such a vertical angle that it's hard to read/view.Without any changes in build quality and improvements to the stand, this keyboard would be a 5-stars rating if it were $25 instead of $29.99.

$REVIEW.: We had this for about 6 months when it stopped turning on. Called customer service and they told me to send it in for repair. I had to pay the shipping charge. The repair was made, a bad main board, and when I got it back it had been poorly packed and there was now a large crack in the front of the unit. Customer service wanted me to send it back again (I would have to pay postage again). I refused and escalated it through 3 levels of customer service. Samsung finally agreed to send me a replacement unit but I would have to send in my old unit first. I agreed. Several days later I got an email that the model was no longer available and I would receive a pro-rated discount. I told them that would not cut it. They finally agreed to a full refund. I sent it in last week and am still waiting to see final resolution. I am now 8 weeks since I sent the unit in the first time.I will not buy from Samsung again and would recommend you stay away also. One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever suffered through.

$review_text.: I bought this specifically for a photo trip I had planned in Arizona.  This worked out great for tagging my photos inAperture 3and the integration was easy, since no software install was really needed for working with this on a mac.  My mode of operating was to put it in the constantly recording mode (I downloaded the PDF manual from the website as that was newer than what was included on the cd with the packaging), then whenever I finished shooting photos, I turned it off again (though sometimes I forgot).  At the end of the day I would connect the logger to my laptop and see it as a drive with a folder full of log files in there.  I copied these off to my computer and then deleted them from the logger (to make sure there was enough space).  In Aperture after importing my photos into a project I then added my GPS logs to the project.  Using the Places tool in Aperture I could then line up a photo I knew with a GPS track, Aperture then prompts me as to whether I want all of the pictures automatically tagged based on the timestamps (adjusting for the difference between the photo I picked and the track time for the location I picked).  Now I can browse my pictures on a map and see where it was we were hiking.The battery life was great and the logging seemed to work well based on the tracks that I saw.  I used the strap that came with the logger to strap it to my camera bag or to my belt loop when not carrying my bag around with me.  A couple of improvements would help this product:1) Add an LCD for some information display2) Display the battery life percentage on the display3) Display the time that the GPS unit thinks it is, making it easier to check the time on the camera to make sure things are synced upI'm glad I bought the device, even though I was uncertain based on the reviews I saw and I was taking it on a trip without having time to test it and get used to it.  This will be one of the items I make part of my standard travel kit.

$review_text.: First I popped the drive in a spare SATA port, went into Windows 7 disk management and activated the disk
 Then went to crucials site and followed instructions for updating the firmware


Then proceeded to install the OS.Disconnected all my hard drives except for the ssd.(VERY IMPORTANT OR WINDOWS MIGHT NOT SEE THE DRIVE WHEN YOU GO TO REINSTALL THE OS)  Installed win7 x64

 Once my pc was back together again, it benched a 7.4 WEI
 The ssd benched a 7.7


 For some reason my gpu was the weakest link


 I am running triple monitors though.I notice a huge difference in the responsiveness of operating windows
 Have not used many programs yet, but I can tell you that opening (most) programs and (ANY) windows application is instant

 Open my computer, control panel, computer management, AMD CCC, etc, and it all opens intantly!  No more waiting around!  Saw huge improvement in itunes opening

 It used to take a good 5-10 seconds for itunes to show up after clicking on it

 64 gigs is not a lot of space


 Even after almost a year of using this drive, I managed to keep my drive about 40% free
 There are times when a program will spit data to the drive and all the sudden I'll see the drive at 95% full!  Use the free program winDirStat
THIS PROGRAM IS GREAT!!!!  It sorts your drive contents by size

 This way you can locate where big chunks of data are on your SSD and relocate them.

$review_text.: I have used this Blu Ray player for more than a week and it plays the following without any issues directly from Blue Ray disc as well as DVD, CD and USB:DivxHD (Divx HD 720p and 1080p profile that create files with Divx extension) NOTE: DivxHD Plus profile creating mkv files seems not workingAVI ( I haven't tried all codecs but whatever I tried worked without any issues)MKVAVCHDI was successfully able to play couple of 720p 4.35 GB mkv files with that's encoded with H264 & DTS audio with subtitle without any issues. Subtitle worked perfectly fine.Files with DTS audio plays flawless directly on TV speakers without requiring any additional DTS receiver.Very responsive remote control.Played lots of MKV files of size 8GB and greater with h264 and DTS audio from an external USB drive and they all played very well. Subtitles were supported and no jitter in playback.MKV playback is awesome and Up-conversion works great.I can clearly see the difference between regular playback and upconversion (the files I have used were IMAX HD documentaries and Disney Pixar movies i.e. quality of the original file was good to start with).I tried Verbatim LTH some very cheap media from Meritline and Optical Quantam BD-R burned using IMGBURN in my LG  WH10LS30 Blue Ray burner and everything worked flawless.I tried about 20 of dirt cheap DVD media Dynex, Teon, Playo etc. which had avi files with variety of codecs recorded about 5-6 years ago and they all played without any issues.Blu Ray disc loads really fast the picture quality is crystal clear. Also quality of You tube and picasa is great.Overall, it's great inexpensive player that played many media from various sources. It played various file formats not even supported by Philips 5982 Divx player but I still can't retire my WD Live as its picky about codecs i.e. not all mkv files plays flawless and MOV doesn't work at this point.UPDATE: I was successfully able to play Blu-Ray video files (m2ts) directly from hard drive via. USB connection. Menu is not supported but the files played successfully.

There's no on/off switch. That is annoying after a while. I guess that would have raised the price a little, but I would have gladly paid a bit more for the convenience of a switch.

$REVIEW.: It is cheaper than the ipad yes. There are however many draw backs to saving the money.1 if you are a mac family do not expect an easy transition into this tablets world.  The device does not sync to your Mac computers very well.  When you do get it to recognize the tablet managing it does not work very well.2  The Ads...this tablet has adds with every app or operation you try to use.  Very annoying.3  The expandable memory is very misleading.  You can add a micro chip to expand to 32 however this extra memory does not apply to APPS.If you can figure it out you can add Movies and Music to the extra memory but if you have kids that love playing with the apps then you arestuck with an 8 tablet.  You can fit about 6 games on it maybe.  You cannot remove the many " google" apps that as kids you will never use.We bought it for our kids and so far are super disappointed.We were lied to about being able to use our AMAZON PRIME membership with this device(you can only read books.  The device does not support AMAZONs streaming.It has a nice screen and when you can watch movies its a pretty picture.  So there I said something nice.I do not have a kindle fire but from my friends reviews they do not have the issues we have had with this tablet.You do get what you pay for.Update: After trying to make this work with the help of a Samsung rep we gave up.  The tablet is poorly designed.  We have returned them and gone with another tablet.We were very disappointed in everything about these tablets.  We are now stuck with the microSD cards and cases.

$REVIEW.: I regret having purchased this item for the following reasons:1. You must use a USB port in order for the mouse's receiver to work.2. The mouse must be facing the USB port and receiver.3. You must constantly press the reset buttons on both the mouse and the receiver.4. The mouse cannot be more than 10 inches away from the receiver for the mouse to work.5. The battery lasts all of two days before it needs to be replaced.I am right-handed but my USB ports are all on the left-hand side of my computer. Therefore, I had to use my left-hand to use this mouse! I couldn't do very much school work - which is primarily what I use the mouse for, nor could I play time management games.After using this mouse, I immediately ordered a $60 Logitech mouse that works without a pad and I have had nothing even similar to the problems that I had with this microsoft product.In short: BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!Save yourself some money and even worse disappointment.

$review_text.: It's always a bit unnerving buying something sight unseen that has less than a 5 stars review. No problems with this unit though.First, identify what it is. Or rather, what it isn't. If you just got that grant for the PBS documentary, or your kid got accepted to Film School and you are looking for the congrats gift you should look elsewhere.But if you are looking for an inexpensive, extremely easy to use unit for vids you'd normally miss, THIS is the piece.I bought two, sight and trying unseen. One for my in laws and one for my wife. BOTH of them say they love it. (Do you know how hard it is to please that group?!?)Personally, I prefer more photography oriented stuff. I shoot Leica, Nikon, Hassy for stills. But this camera IS great and I like using it. Three or four buttons to shoot and record and playback, period. No scores of user screen menus to wade and get lost through. It fits in ones hand really well. And it is a great size. Big enough that you don't feel like it will break if you squeeze it, but small enough to be carried places.And of course, that is the key.  An Instamatic takes much better pictures over a Leica M8, IF the Leica is home and the Kodak is in your hand.  This is a camera you or your giftee will use and carry.On the techie side, comes complete with batteries and card. Open the clam shell (ugh!) and it is ready to shoot. Has a neat pop up USB connector so it plugs right into your computer (no cable to carry.) Lens cap is rubber (good). I'd say the only design flaw is the weird cover over the USB connector. What is that about?  Even so, this is a 100 out of 100 in my book. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this as a gift for anyone.Go ahead, spring for it.revised in June 09.  Not only did I spring for it the first time, my wife lost hers on vacation and I bought the exact same one for her again.  It still lives up to what I said in my review.

$REVIEW.: I bought these because somebodies at the company spent a lot of time, research and development creating this product if they were willing to charge that much for them originally. These are very well made, light but substantial. They fit nicely in your ear; look fine( c'mon they're just earbuds!). The sound you hear whether turned up or down is crystal clear. What you hear is what it would sound like if it was played live( thumpy if recorded that way, trebly if meant to sound that way). The music seems projected beyond you. I have had about 70 hours logged on them and, all I can say, is they are simply amazing. Take the risk and spend $40 on these. I rate them audiophile quality.

The speaker hangs off the back of the monitor screen and plugs into the laptop via the USB port and the sound is 150% better than before.I would recommend this speaker to friends and/or family and I am planning to buy it for another laptop I have in the very near future. Overall, this is a good product, it is easy to set up and has good quality sound that is easy to hear.===>Amazon PRIME shipped the item quickly, I purcahsed it yesterday and it arrived today!!

$REVIEW.: This product has been in my computer for 2 years and is still working!  Great reliability and has never failed.  the only problem I have is that there is visible glue on the assembly, but it does not interfere with operation.  I guess no one is going to be looking in the machine so no problem there!

$REVIEW.: I received these yesterday and can't say enough good things about them.  From reading other reviews, I was worried about two things:1. They would look too big or too industrial / military.  They do not, they are the perfect size and look great.2. They would be too heavy.  Not sure why people thought this, they feel light on your head and do not look big at all.The sounds quality is great as other posts have pointed out.  I have listened to Beats by Dre, and these are better for half the price.  Just buy them already.

$REVIEW.: I have a 15 inch Macook Pro with Retina Display with dual boot between Mac OS and Windows 8. This drive works great with both OS.One caveat, for some reason, the Windows 8 did NOT recognize this drive until I installed some OS updates for Windows 8. So you may want to update your Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and install all the important OS updates prior to plugging this drive.I was, however, perfectly able to install Windows 8 via Apple Bootcamp, which runs on the Mac OS.Although this drive comes with a separate power cord, it is optional. I plug this drive into my USB 3.0 hub (which itself has a separate power source), and there is no additional connection necessary to power this blue ray writer/burner.I have yet to try a blu ray disc, but all my DVD and DVD-RW discs work perfectly for reading/writing both on Mac and Windows.Pros:1)The silver color matches my MacBook Pro perfectly.2)Fast performance. Both Mac OS and Windows 8.1 recognizes this drive almost instantly and the I/O seems to be very fast as well.3)Small form factor.4)Sturdy (at least from the exterior).5)Works with both Mac OS and Windows 8.6)Plugging into A/C power is optional if plugged into USB 3.0 compatible hub.Cons:1)The cords are very short (about 12 inches). You may want to consider purchasing an extra long USB cable.

Being a cord cuter I have been without cable from some time now, only paying for an internet connection has saved me a boat load money.

Tried on two motherboards, but the system crashes the time it loads the driver, unlike 3 other different SATA-3 boards I have used, that work fine.Bought it to see if I could daisy chain four drives in one SATA-3 connector (using a ProBox HD docking station that only works well under USB 3.0), but as other have said, this is a piece of junk, and not surprisingly has no support.Please note that I am a professional computer technician, with over 30 years of experience. I'm used to managing complex RAID systems at work, and this board is the worst controller I have seen in over a decade. Would return it if I could, but unfortunately the money I'll pay to ship it isn't worth it.

$REVIEW.: So far it's a fail, and I haven't even started using it, here is the reason...I ordered this alarm system on Friday, I paid for the overnight saturday delivery option through Amazon and the system shipped and was delivered as promised and as paid for. I started to unbox the system and got stuck on step 1... remove the base unit from the box and remove the battery activation strip. The base unit I received had no battery activation strip. I plugged it in and the batteries were dead. These are rechargeable batteries but they thing even after left plugged in won't work and hold a charge.So at this point I have a bunch of pieces of plastic around the house and nothing to do with them.I tried to contact simplisafe via the customer service number and conveniently their offices are closed on Saturdays.Initial impressions, this is a bad system based on the fact I can't use it, at all. Now, if they "fix" my issues then perhaps things will turn around, but I expect reimbursement for my Saturday delivery and new batteries to be shipped to me before that happens.---UPDATE 12/2/13---I purchased new batteries at my local store and got the alarm working. Simplisafe believes that based upon that the power adapter is bad and not the batteries they shipped. They are overnighting me a new power adapter and have given me a free month of monitoring for the trouble. I'll do a full review update once the new adapter arrives.--UPDATE 12/30/13---I forgot to come back and update my review, my apologies! The new adapter arrived a few days after simplisafe shipped it (shipped it on a weekend so as expected took a few extra days). The new adapter fixed my issues and I have not had a single issue since. The sensors are mounted on my doors, I even was able to mount one to my garage door so when it opens it triggers the chime inside.Simplisafe stepped up and fixed my issue, diagnosed what I thought was dead batteries correctly as a dead power supply. They gave me credit for a month of service for the inconvenience and really have been a great company to have protecting my house. No complaints at all and I am working on getting more adapters from them to totally replace my old ADT system. Thanks Simplisafe for the great service and fixing a broken power adapter.

$REVIEW.: There are those who need the very best, high-end, high fidelity ear candy. I am not one of those, and these are not one of them.I am frankly too old in the ear to gain the benefits of the best, and even if I weren't, the idea of spending over 100 dollars on a pair of what will inevitably be a pair of disposable headphones insults my sensibilities.I have better long-term junk I'd rather waste a Franklin on.These guys are for train commuting, 45 minutes twice a day, five days a week. The headphones strap on, get wrapped around the ipod, and get lightly misused. I know they're going to bust - it takes about 6-9 months. In fact, these are the third pair of this model I've purchased, and they're in reserve for that day when the left earphone on my current set starts to crackle and die. Then, I'll buy a fourth pair to hold in reserve in expectation of this pair's death. .The way I figure it, that'll give me about two and a half years use for 36 bucks. With Dre &#34;Beats&#34; running $150, this tin-eared codger can make do with 11 years of these things for the same cash. Past that, I doubt I'd get them past the hearing aids. Or the mortuary.The old gray horse aint what he used to be; but he's still taking his music on the go, and even at a buck a month, the sound quality is better than those Walkman players my generation started out with. So, OK.

$review_text.: So, it seems like the iPad stylus getting all the attention and adoration is thePogo Sketch Stylus. Having just spent a week using it, I can honestly say it's a piece of crap. The tip is overly soft and flops back and forth while you write. It also requires that you press entirely too hard before the iPad senses it. I now take all my meeting notes on my iPad, and the Pogo Sketch was too thin which, combined with the amount of pressure required, makes longer note-taking sessions actually a bit painful.So, at my co-worker's suggestion, I ordered the BoxWave stylus. It's a thousand times better. The tip is more firm and rounded, so it doesn't move while using it. It feels more like a real pen, instead of a bad paintbrush. I suppose it costs a few bucks more, but it's worth it. Going from the Pogo Sketch to the BoxWave was like going from a Toyota Yaris to an Audi R8.Actually, that's insulting to the Toyota...

$REVIEW.: I actually bought 4 of these thinking i'd shoehorn all 4 into a small custom rectangular box to go behind the back seat of my Chevy crew cab. After a bit more research i opted to only put in two instead of all four. They Thump amazingly well considering the 11in tall x 48in long x 6in deep inclosure. These two are being driven by a 400 watt Jensen 2 channel amp. Kinda flat at Very low hz but for better lower response U need a 12in anyway. Too high up the range & they tend to get muddy.  But for me this is exactly what i needed to get that extra bass kick ater replacing all 4 factory speakers & loosing the factory low volume bass.  Well worth the money!

$review_text.: I have a custom-graphic version of this mouse (available here and at Logitech's Web site).I've used a touch mouse (Manhattan) for a couple of weeks, but it was so frustrating that I bought the M325.- The touch mouse has much lower profile (good); the M325 looks a VW Beetle in comparison. At the highest point, the M325 measures about 1.5 inch.- The M325 does not go to sleep quickly (as the touch mouse does); no need to waste time trying to wake up a mouse every few minutes...- The scroll wheel is very lightweight, but it's better than I thought; it allows fast scrolling of a long Web page (good).I recommend one of the custom-graphic mice vs. yet another one in a "drab" color (unless there is a fear that attractive mouse could be stolen).

$REVIEW.: I wanted this audio player to listen to library audio books. For that it worked for about a week and then it was dead. It would not power on even after charging. Other reviewers have said the same so I should have listened. Also the maximum volume was barely high enough when piping the sound into my car radio, but ok for ear bud use. Luckily my Pocket PC, a Dell Axim, worked to play the DRM files, plus its touch screen makes navigation easy. I still would like a small player like the Zen, since the Axim is a bit bulky.

$review_text.: I upgraded to the 16 GB iPod Touch from my old 2 GB first generation iPod nano about a week ago and I couldn't be more satisfied.  This is truly a state-of-the-art media player, Internet device, and, with the $10 purchase of the iPhone 2.0 software, mobile computing platform.  This device is so much more than just an iPod.  If you can't afford to pay AT&T;'s insane monthly iPhone rates ($70 without text messages last I checked), this is as good as it gets.Before I get too in depth, I just want to strongly recommend that you forgo the cheaper 8 GB model and go for the 16 GB.  I was seriously considering the 8 GB model because, hey, I was only upgrading because my iTunes library was just over 2 GB.  I am very glad that I went for the 16 GB now, however.  If you would like to put podcasts, video files, and iPhone 2.0 applications on your iPod, they are going to take up more space than you would think.  I currently have over 9 GB of stuff on my iPod even though my music library is only about 600 songs (about 2.25 GB).I know that it's a little pricey to go for the 16 GB, but I actually bought mine used on eBay for less than the price of a new 8 GB (with a hard shell case, screen protector, and the original box to boot).  Plus, you'll be much less inclined to want to upgrade in the future as long as you have plenty of space on your current device.  I would even say go for the 32 GB if your budget can handle it.The iPod Touch is not only a great device for music, but an even better device for video.  The 3.5 inch widescreen display is very sharp and not as small as it sounds.  It's great for watching video podcasts and even full length TV shows and movies.The internet experience on the iPod Touch is just phenomenal.  You're not just getting the "mobile internet", you're getting full web pages exactly the way you're used to seeing them on your computer at home (minus flash and the big screen of course).  The multi-touch navigation of web pages is very slick and easy to get the hang of.  This is a mobile browser that you'll actually use.Also, if you are planning on purchasing your iPod Touch new, please make sure that you get the iPhone 2.0 software from Apple so that you can get access to the "App Store".  I was lucky enough to already have it installed on mine when I bought it, but the upgrade costs $10 if you buy your iPod new.Even though some of the apps cost $5 or $10, the majority are free.  Some cool apps that you can download on to your iPod for free include AOL Instant Messenger, eBay, New York Times headlines, Wordpress, and Facebook.  There's also an app called movies that will list all movie showtimes at the theaters in your area, as well as a super cool baseball app that gives the baseball geek access to the past century of statistics or trivia wherever he may be.  The list goes on and on for the cool stuff that you can install.Now, while the iPod Touch is the closest thing out there to the iPhone experience, it still has its disadvantages compared to Apple's smartphone.  For example, while you can access the Internet, read and send e-mail, etc on your iPod Touch, it is only possible when you are near WiFi.  On the iPhone, if you are on-the-go and not near a wireless internet connection, you can do all of this over the celluar network which is available almost everywhere you are.  The opportunity to use WiFi, on the other hand, doesn't present itself as often as you may think.  If you're traveling and want to check your e-mail, it means stopping at a Starbucks or a Borders, and you won't get alerted right when your e-mails arrive like an iPhone user would.All those are things to consider if you are thinking of the iPod Touch as your way of getting around AT&T;'s rate plans.  While the iPod Touch is the best iPod available, you won't have all the conveniences of an iPhone user.Another minor annoyance is that there is no volume button on the outside of the iPod, and when the iPod goes to sleep, you have to "slide to unlock" in order to use the touch volume controls.All in all, though, I am very happy with my iPod Touch.  It's the best portable media player out there and it does so much more than just that.  Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Yes - I should have read the reviews before buying these. The fit is extremely loose, to the point that you will need to do something to ensure the cables remain plugged. I have used duct tape whenever I could, but perhaps adding some crazy glue to the outer portion of the plug, then waiting for it to dry, then plugging it - could also work because it seems that these cables were just cut a millimeter short - and thats why they are so cheap.
$SUMMARY.: very loose fitting!!

$REVIEW.: Didn't buy this at Amazon, but ended up returning 3 bad copies in a row before giving up.  The first had severe softness at 75mm.  The 2nd had severe BF at 28mm.  The 3rd had slight BF at 28mm and softness at 75mm.While testing I saw flashes of super sharpness (75mm on 2nd lens and 50mm on 3rd lens).  If Tamron could figure out what's wrong w/ their design so it can be more consistently manufactured, they'd have a real winner.I did wish the range were 24-70 instead of 28-75 though...the Sigma 24-70 uses a ridiculous 82mm filter (they should stop at 77mm or the filter prices get ridiculous).

$REVIEW.: What a great product, finally I have coverage over the rest of the house with 100% signal.  I using a WRT54G Linksys Wireless Router in the den as my base unit.  The signal just was reaching the other end of the house even with the high gain Antenna's I added.  I read the other reviews and skip the CD setup in the box.  First I signed into and disabled the Security on the 54G.  Then I plugged in the expander, held down the button till the lights went blue and then signed into the expander 192.168.1.240 and setup the security to match the base unit and saved it.  Then I went back to 54G and turn on secruity again and everything worked like a champ!  Not sure why Linksys didn't write it up that simple, guess it may vary based on your configuration.  Now my wife and I can go anywhere in the house and the patio with a strong signal.

$REVIEW.: I recently upgraded my DSL to 8Mb.  Pricing for the new speed includes a separate charge for the DSL modem.  I had a Embarq 660r router configured to run in bridged mode so all I need is a bridged ADSL2+ modem.The only configuration I did was changing the modems IP from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1 which is the same as the 660r.  (This allows me to access it on the wan port of my TomatoUSB based router)I then plugged it into my router and phone line.  It then connected to Centurylink at 8Mb with no further configuration needed.If it stands up to the test of time, I couldn't have made a better choice.For all the geeks out there that are unfamiliar with access to a bridged modem on the wan port there is a DD-WRT Wiki that tells you how.  In TomatoUSB, my commands to allow access to 192.168.2.1 are:INIT Script:sleep 10ifconfig vlan2:0 192.168.2.2Firewall Script:iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o vlan2 -d 192.168.1.1 -j MASQUERADE

$REVIEW.: Mine failed within 3 weeks--the software just hung.  The manual is useless and the web faqs almost as much.  No e-mail support, just web-based.  After getting an RMA number, I mailed the unit back.  Now (3 weeks later) they are asking for a $25 "diagnostic fee" before they'll look at the unit, along with a note not to reply to the e-mail.  Instead they give you a hyperlink back to their Customer Support web page, where you need to fill out an e-mail form and plug your RMA number in.  (I'm assuming that the request for a "diagnostic fee" is a mistake.  If not, I'll be talking to the District Attorney's Consumer Fraud division).The amount of hassle I've gone through over this *far* outweighs the benefits it has over the iPod (which, when it works, really are there).  This may be a technically superior product, but Apple Support is easy.  Creative's is as shabby as I've ever been subject to.Never again.

$REVIEW.: I don't know in what dimension Motorola thinks you will get 23 miles with these radios, but for local and close communications, they work great.I just test drove ours at a recent trip to Disney World and on a Caribbean cruise.  Because I live overseas, using our cell phones is ridiculously expensive so the radios make much better economic sense.  They worked around the islands and they worked great at Disney whenever we got separated in a store or sight seeing.  They were also handy in places like malls, Walmart, etc.  Hey, you don't need any plan to use them.  Just push and talk.The feature that really sold me was the USB port charging capability.  Not having to lug around a cradle charger or swap out batteries was a real bonus.  There were a few occasions where the radios came on when jostled around in our back-packs, but on a full charge you will get several hours of use.  Since our jaunts were no more than six hours at a go between breaks, we never had any problems with drained batteries.  We're really happy with them and hope to use them for some years to come.

I also thought it might help me stabilize shots since my camera is so small and light.  It does do a great job holding the mic, but the plastic it's made from almost wants to float up to the ceiling.  Not that it isn't strong enough, but I can hold the whole rig with my pinky and not have it get tired.  The adjustable mounting configuration on the bottom is great.  Definitely worth the money for what it is.

$REVIEW.: I bought this system yesterday.  It has great, even sound and multiple sound fields for different situations (movies, games, sports, etc).  I like that the speakers are small (the center channel speaker) disappears in front of my television.  Also, there are 3 HDMI inputs for everything I need (Blu-Ray player, Computer, etc) and one output for the television.  There are also inputs for analog and digital audio sources.  One drawback is that the 'wireless' rear speakers are only wireless when coupled with the optional AIR EZW-T100 Wireless transmitter and the Wireless amplifier for the speakers (WAHT-SA10).  This wasn't a problem until I found that the amplifier doesn't seem to be available anywhere.  Even the SonyStyle store shows 'out of stock'.  Aside from that, this is a great-looking and sounding system for a reasonable price.  As long as you don't demand wireless rear speakers in the immediate future, I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: I bought this after breaking my Canon G9 and this Nikon has all the same characteristics as the Canon it replaces-good pictures under favorable conditions and acceptable to good pictures under unfavorable conditions


This is acceptable to me because I can put it in my coat pocket and have it with me - just like what I liked about my old Canon
I was a Canon guy when I was familiar with their interface and now I'm a Nikon guy after learning their system


 I don't think the debate between the two is any more then that
Size,shape,function and build quality are very close between the two.The $500 cost of the G12 and P7000 is too high for these cameras compared to $700 for a Nikon D3100 or comparable DSLR so I purchased the Nikon because it was $100 less then the Canon thru Walmart.Face facts,this is not as fast as a camera that costs twice as much and is triple the size

I used to carry a Nikon F2 35mm and five lenses back in the 70's and gave up photography because of how intrusive that was

 Although,if you want to have more to play with I would get a DSLR and that would be good too.The limitations are:Low light performance, which is to be expected with this image sensor technologyso low light focusing can be a problem but can be worked around some by using the low light / low noise setting.Aperture range is limited to f2.8 to f8 with widest setting and f5.6 to f8 at max telephoto setting


 This is a obvious limitation that you will need to live with.The lens cover and lens assembly as a whole feels vulnerable and kinda cheap.I purchased a extra two years warranty from Walmart for $35

I would like to have a D3100 or d5100 DSLR and have inspected them at the store and those cameras also looked and felt plastic-y- so how much do you need to spend to get a higher quality piece of equipment?The high points:Overall beautiful pictures and OK video.Function controls feel solid and there are plenty of manual controls to put you in control of the process.Two control wheels to use - one for shutter speed and the other for aperture changes.7x zoom which is better then the Canon.Viewfinder shows less then finished photo but the image can be cropped later if you like


Why people complain about the viewfinder is beyond me as I find it very workable and would never have bought this camera or any camera that didn't have one.I hope I have been of some help.

This does the job by connecting wirelessly through bluetooth with the PC and it also has a port to use an AUX cable with non bluetooth devices.Pros:-Great sound quality-Versatile connectivity-Light weight-Comes with a case and all needed cables-True to battery duration (10-12 hours)-Great price!Cons:-On and off switch works weirdly, you have to press it for 4 secs to turn off and 5 secs if you want to turn it on and pair it via bluetooth so turning it off is kind of hard, you have to be very exact!-Volume buttons don't work when connected via AUX port, you will have to adjust the volume on the device it's connected to.-It leaks a lot of sound so it will definitely disturb others around you (this can be a deal breaker to those who use these sort of headphones in public, not my case though, however do consider that sound leak proof headphones will be very expensive).Highly recommended product for it's quality, versatility and price!

$REVIEW.: I just received my Roku 3 streaming player today. Since I had a couple older Roku's it was simple for me to hook up...but simple anyway. Superb instructions included! The one thing I REALLY love the most is the little headphone input on the remote control (which by the way you do not have to even point at the Roku box...can be used from anywhere in the room) because now all I have to do is put the included headphones on ~ yes they even include a nice purple pair with 3 different size ear pieces ~ and not disturb anyone else in the area. Plus the remote is so easy to use and full of features. The size of the Roku box is so small, leaving me more room on my cluttered desktop, but it's dynamite and looks so classy!I do not have any regrets about purchasing another one of these Roku players ... this one by far surpasses all the rest in my opinion. Offering the 1080p instead of just 720p makes a huge difference in the picture quality if your TV is broadcasting in 1080p as well.Because it only has a 3 month factory warranty I did buy an extended one from Square Trade and now I have 3 full years of coverage for really cheap!You will most certainly be pleased with your purchase! I am!!!! A++++++++++ all the way!!!!

$REVIEW.: When I received it, I was extremely happy with the art work.  As I proceeded to put this against the laptops I had it does not fit any wide screens that is larger than 14 1/2".  It should not state "Fits 13" wide to 16.5" wide screen size laptop".  If you measure your laptop screen diagonal ten it might fit because it is approximately 18" that way. The height is 11", width is  it is 14 1/2", diagonal is 18". I tried to put it on my older laptop but it was out of alignment a little bit so I tried to peel it off - mistake!  It peeled the black paint off. Also,they stated that it included 2 wrist pad with each laptop skin sticker. They are not actually wrist pads but two stickers only that I assume is suppose to go on the wrist pads.I'll wait to rate the seller to see what their resolution is because when I contacted them, they told me to buy a bigger one for my 15" Dell.

$review_text.: This modem is very well constructed, it doesnt feel cheap although is very light, I wanted this because my cable and internet company where I live sells Huawei routers that are significantly inferior to a TP LINK and for double the price, so I wanted something that was quality made, not too expensive but at the same time efficient in giving me a constant wifi signal in my two story house. I wanted a router that had a adsl connection for my telephone line, so the TP link w8960N was the best choice for all of the above factors. It has been functioning for 1 month and I havent had any problems with the signals anymore, so I can definetly recommend this product to you all
$review_summary.: At last I can have a constant internet signal!

$review_text.: I've only had this for about one week, but works exactly as I need so far for my current setup.  I bought the 5 port Kinivo 501BN to connect multiple devices to one of the HDMI ports on my Harman Kardon receiver.  My Christmas purchase of a Sony PS4 was what made me finally bite the bullet and buy this thing so as to preserve my last available HDMI port on my receiver.  I currently have a PS3, PS4, Vizio Co-Star, and Apple TV hooked up to it and the 5th port is currently open.  I have not yet had to use either the switch button on the Kinivo or the remote since the auto switching works perfectly to switch to the last device I turn on.  I do turn off each component after use so I'm not sure if it would behave properly if I did not do that.  But the way I use it, it is perfect.  The unit feels high quality and only time will tell if it lasts long, but I have no reason yet to think otherwise.  Highly recommend.

$REVIEW.: Beautifully made, the Pangea Audio is definitely an upgrade in quality over the standard power wire for my subwoofer.  Did it improve the sound?  I ordered slightly too short (1m) and thus had to move the subwoofer closer to the power point.  Can't do a comparison then.  But I'd buy it for the built quality alone.

$REVIEW.: Quite good sound from these little speakers! I could do without all the cables (3) and the necessity of plugging it into a USB port. It's also a little difficult to fit it all back into the nice zippered case it comes with, so I use that for my tinny sounding passive speakers. I'm sure it will be worth the trouble to attach some velcro or poster putty to keep it all in place while using it to view videos on the computer. While one cannot have everything, I like these very much.

$REVIEW.: I took baby steps, first I got the iPod Shuffle, Nano 1st generation, Nano 3rd generation and now I have the ultimateApple iPod Touch 16 GB (2nd Generation)! Wow what a difference. The screen is unbelievably crystal clear and bright. The volume buttons located in the side of the unit is one great improvement from using the clicking wheel to adjust the volume. The built-in speaker is great since now you can listen to music, watch videos and play games without using earplugs. You have to remember though since this is so slim that the speaker has to be tiny and because of that it does not produce the best audio quality, but that is what you earplugs are for. The speaker comes in handy when wanting to preview a song, video or if you want to share something that has sound with your friends. Has a long battery life, it can last for more than a week just using a few hours a day. The tilt and turn feature that follows your movements is incredible. I am not going to go on and on about this review since so many have already mentioned the great features the iPod Touch has and I agree with all of them. Thanks to the great reviews and comments that were made, I am trilled I purchased this and now I sit here wondering what am I going to do with all my older models. :-)

$review_text.: ...from a Canon PowerShot.This is the first DSLR I've bought, and considering the lens the camera came with, I could not be happier. As an amateur just beginning to get into photography for eventual professional use, this camera boasts everything I've ever wanted but never found in cheaper digital cameras targeted at the average consumer. Primarily: incredibly fast snapping speed (especially compared against those cheaper digital cameras I was talking about... which take forever for every picture :/), and an incredibly intuitive interface for configuring everything.I remember I had a real headache just trying to just change ISO settings on an old Canon PowerShot. I don't think I was even able to change shutter speed, much less manually focus the camera - but of course, all of these things that I've wanted to experiment with for years are now finally a snap with this camera. Consequently, every picture I take with this camera is eons ahead of anything any auto-focus camera I've used has ever been able to offer.On a related note, the fact that you also get a heads up within the viewfinder about shutter speed, etc. - is awesome!But if that's all I was looking for, I would've opted for a cheaper D3100. What really differentiated the D5100 was the additional abilitiy to capture full 1080p video. While I'm not aiming to create a film with this camera, I'd recently begun hunting for a cheap digital camcorder to use for motion capture for animation references. The fact that the D5100 was a step-up from the D3100 at the same cost of any decent camcorder sold me on the spot.On a sidenote: I am thoroughly satisfied with the lens the camera comes with, but I'm already beginning to see what other sorts of lenses I want to explore and use. I'm glad the price-point didn't hit the one-thousand-wall because now I have more money to put into lenses later down the line.Since I lack the experience to proffer a more technical review of the camera, let me make my concluding remarks: I am completely satisfied with my purchase and entry into the world of DSLRs. I don't see myself ever turning back, and I can foresee myself using this camera alone for at least several years. While the key distinguishing feature for the D5100 vs. the 3100 was the video capture (the MP increase isn't necessary for my needs), I doubt that's the case for everyone. If you're looking to purchase your first DSLR, not looking for video capture, and the increased megapixel count isn't necessary, I recommend you check out other reviews that make more point-by-point comparisons between the D5100 and D3100 to see if you might be able to save some money. Save it so you can put it into buying lenses, of course.
$SUMMARY.: Wow! What a step up...

$review_text.: With the price of &#34;cloud&#34; storage, for people with a lot of data it can actually be cheaper to just purchase an external hard disk and backup their files locally. Obviously this can be a problem if you have a fire in your house, so I would recommend that you try to store at least one of your recent backups offsite somewhere, perhaps with family, perhaps a safety deposit box.This hard drive provides a good cheap way to perform a backup. For most, 3tb should be more than enough, and can probably be used for multiple backups.I don't trust external drives for more than backups, but this should provide a great solution for those of you looking to backup your files and documents. I found the drive performed decent during my backup process.

As others have mentioned the cover has cut-outs for the camera and openings for all of the other connections and buttons and never gets in the way.  What I liked more about the cover is the included pen holder located in the rear of the cover and hand strap located inside the cover not exposed until you open the cover to use.  This cover came with something new for me that I haven't seen on any covers I've owned before, A place to hold credit/business cards and two opening for SD cards.  The SD card slot doesn't seem like it was cut out right and i'm trying to slowly work a sd card  into the slot so I don't rip the material or the threads.  This is the reason for the four star review for me, other than that it would easily get five stars.

$REVIEW.: This is the third card reader I have purchased.  I have several digital cameras, that use different memory cards, (Nikon, Sony, Canon, HP and Pentax), and it has worked flawlessly with my Macs which range from a G4 to a MacBookPro/Intel and also with an older IMac as well as a friend's Sony PC.With any type of inexpensive device that is critical for data transfer, (and this is, in my opinion, inexpensive) I buy two so I will have one as a backup if one fails when I am travelling, or in the middle of the night when there are no stores open.  I have been using the first unit almost daily for 8 months and have yet to encounter any problem.  On a crowded desk, it has a small footprint, is easy to access and insert and remove the cards.  If there is a better one on the market, I have yet to find it.With any device it is important to keep it clean, avoid dropping or stacking things on top of it.  I have examined one that the son of a neighbor complained about not working, however, there was lint and what looked like confetti INSIDE the card ports.  Once the debris was removed, the unit worked.  Also, the USB plug must be kept clean, when not attached to a USB hub or the computer, slip a little plastic bag over the plug and secure it or put the entire unit in a plastic bag.

$REVIEW.: Though I can't vouch for longevity (yet), in every other way I really love this drive.  The cables that come with it are shielded, it copied all the data I had for it very quickly for a drive of its size, and it offered me no difficulties even though I used it with both a Mac and a  Win7 machine.  This is my new 'bug out' drive, and it's better in every way than the one it replaces, which is no slouch; it's served me well these six years.  I especially like the fact that it carries an extra cable right in the drive, so that it can just be grabbed and put in a pocket in a second or so.This drive comes fat-formatted so it won't take large files over 5GB, but it works with Win7 and MacOS Mavericks & Lion right out of the box, which is why I didn't change the format at all.  I'm sure it works with Mountain Lion, Snow Leopard, Win8 and XP too, but I didn't try any of those, so I can't verify the fact from my own experience.The price seems excellent for what you get.  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Be sure to check the various sizes, as the larger drives sometimes are only a few dollars more (sometimes the smaller drive costs more too be careful).  In recommend getting the biggest drive you can afford as sometime you may/will need it.If you're a Mac user setting up or erasing this flash/thumb drive up with your computer is super easy follow these steps.1. Plug in the the drive2. Open up disk utility found in your applications folder inside the utilities folder3. Next select the newly plugged in a thumb drive and on the right-hand side you should see partition click on that.4. Then inside that screen on the partition layout drop-down choose how many partitions you'd like to set up. I generally go with one partition and just use folders to organize my files.5. Then on the right-hand side you can name the partitions and select the format.  If you are transferring video files I highly recommend you choose Mac OS Extended as it can handle files over 4 GB. Sometimes it's good to make two partitions and one using "MS-DOS fat" if you might be transferring files to and from a Windows machine. The reason is Windows machines and Macs can read and write to the "MS-DOS fat" format but your files will need to be under 4 GB each as that's the maximum file size it can handle.6. Then click apply and your Mac will create all the partitions you wanted and you're good to go.Thanks for reading it is helpful please click the button thanks.

As others have written, the "clear" plastic face isn't clear at all, more like foggy or smudged or dusty, and it doesn't clean up, even with water. The slot for a key -- another good idea -- is almost useless. It's not wide enough to securely hold a Schlage housekey (a common brand with a wide head) or most car keys. If you shove the key in as far as it will go and the head is still sticking out, you can bet the key pop out and disappear into the wildneress while you jog or bicycle. The band isn't particularly comfortable, either. Perhaps the most disappointing product I've ever gotten through Amazon.

$REVIEW.: I've had my iPod for about 6 six months and it's revolutionized how I listen to music. Now all the CD music I love and haven't listened to for years is easily accessible in ways I never imagined. I have a PC running XP and I've never had problems with it connecting to the iPod. Transferring CDs to the iPod music system is fast and easy since it transfers at about 10 times the listening speed. I've even started buying  music off the web because the software makes it so easy and affordable at 99 cents a song. Buying just the songs I want to hear is wonderful.Not often mentioned is the (free) iTunes software that runs on your PC. It's really where all the power is for the user. It allows me to organize my songs in any way that suits my tastes in folders that are then transferred to the iPod. And then there's the Smart Folders where I can set up a folder to suit me. For example, I have one for all the songs that I have rated in iTunes as 4 or 5 stars and I have them set to play the ones first that I haven't listed to for the longest. Or the folder that has all the songs that I've labeled as "new artist" so I can become familiar with their songs even though I can't remember their names.Some things to know before you buy this rather expensive device:1. Have a reliable backup to your audio files on your PC. The iPod is designed to be downloaded to.  So if your computer crashes you'll loose all your music and investment. It's not possible to easily get the songs back from the iPod. There are 3rd party applications that can do this but I haven't tried them. I keep all my files backed up on an external hard drive with a backup software called Backup4All.  That added about another $100 to the cost (drive + software) but now I have much more peace of mind and protection for my investment in music files. And since I now backup all my data to the external drive I feel it's well worth the investment.2. Get a case. The iPod case is easily scratched.3. Know that you can get rapid and competent support from the iPod and iTunes discussion groups that are available on the apple web site. Answers to most questions usually come back in minutes.  If you haven't been in an online discussion like this, just know that the people are friendly and are willing to address any question no matter how big or small. They will not make you feel like you asked a stupid question.4. Don't drop your iPod. It's a precision instrument. I dropped mine on a concrete sidewalk while it was in its case. Terrified, I watched in what seemed like slow montion as it hit the ground, the iPod slide out of the case, and slid along the ground. Miraculously it kept working and I have not had any problems that I can attribute to the drop. I got lucky.5. My iPod exhibited annoying behaviors in the first couple of months (before and after the drop) such as the controls locking up or not turning off. Then it would clear up as mysteriously as it started. For months now it's worked flawlessly. One theory that I got off the discussion group is that the iPod may be affected by cold weather.6. Judging from the discussions some people are disappointed with the battery life. Apple advertises 8 hours but it seems shorter. The more iPiod features you turn on the faster the battery drains. And the meter is a little funky. It goes down fast at the start making it look like the battery is draining very fast, but than it slows down. It's not a particular problem for me because I just pay attention and keep it charged. I have never drained the battery.7. Replacing the battery is expensive. It's a sealed-in battery so it really should be replaced by someone who knows what they're doing. Apple charges $100 for a replacement but I believe there are services that cost around $50. I'm hoping to get two years from my battery and by then there will be something smaller and better to tempt me. In the mean time, I purchased a $50 extended warranty for the peace of mind.8. Amazon is a great source for free, legal downloads of music. If you like to experiment with new and mostly unknown artists you can have a ball. Go to http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468646/ref%3Dm%5Fmh%5Fmn%5Fdd/103-1753606-8047008In summary, I would recommend an iPod if you love music and lots of it, if the overall cost is not a significant issue for you, and if you are used to and comfortable with new technology that will undoubtedly improve over the years. If you feel you can't wait then the iPod is for you.

$review_text.: Very disappointed to find it dead on arrival right out of the package. No power led, computer did not find it, etc. It's totally dead. I also don't understand why the power plug and cord are on the same side as the usb ports. So if I want to plug in usb devices, I have to have the cords wrap around the hub. Or to have the cords go back off my desk away from me, I have to plug in usb devices into the back (away from me) of the hub. Which means I have to turn it around to plug something in and then turn it back around to keep the cords from wrapping around the device. A very poor design.It's going back and being replaced with a different brand.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this one because I wanted to take good care of my Surface RT, and I also wanted to keep the screen free of fingerprints and glare. I thought the price I paid ($8.95) was a great deal. I got the item, and had made it up to getting ready to peel the shield back off, after I had wiped down the screen and used the dust tape, and then I noticed the holes in the shield did not match up with the RT, and the size of the shield is just slightly too small.Seeing that Amazon didn't allow for me to request a replacement, I was disappointed and did not find a return/refund to be worth it to me, especially since I was told to drop off the package at UPS, and wait for my $8.95 refund, then would have to spend more money to get the CORRECT item. The title stating &#34;Full Lifetime Replacement Warranty&#34; clearly doesn't apply to if you get the WRONG SHIELD.I doubt I will be ordering from Tech Armor again, but I will try to make do with the shield I have...

$REVIEW.: Great product! I have to agree with one post, this thing beeps for ALL weather related information sent out by the National Weather Service. I was on my feet at 3:30am this morning for a severe weather thunderstorm that was three counties to the North of us. My wife is mad, thankfully she fell right back to sleep! The radio was purchased due to the openess of the area we live in, and a F0 tornado that happened 15 miles to our North a year ago. Our area is mostly cornfields and high winds/tornado's are a real threat, so to keep the family safe and aware, I made my purchase without any hesitation. I don't think you'll go wrong, just make sure radio is set properly (mute or on). With mute, you may never know of a real threat coming through your area.

$REVIEW.: I researched for 6 months before buying this camera and then the upgrade 17-85 IS lens, and thought I had found my perfect camera and lens with live view and all.I noticed right out of the box that all my images were soft but I figured it will take time to get it dialed in.  Four months later and a thousand pictures and settings and I wish I had bought the Nikon D40 for 1/2 the cost or D60.  My $1200 system with the upgrade lens takes pictures that time after time are not as in focus as D40 with Kit lens that has no image stabilization.  The only shots that even come close are done with live view and manual focusing and then edited heavily..... Update to above review... I returned my camera to Canon for repair.  I just got it back and they made adjustments in the camera's electronics and I do notice an improvement.  I will not get rid of the camera after all.  To bad quality control could not get it right the first time. I had no trouble with Canon and the warrantee.

$review_text.: The Kensington Comerercio Soft Folio case looks attractive with its faux leather finish, and soft interior which includes spaces for business cards, and bits of paper.  It installs pretty easily, and it holds the iPad Air (5) very securely because of a tabbed mounting system.In use, the cover folds back and it will slide into a slot on the back for a makeshift stand.  A lot of products do this, and it seems to be a standard feature in this type case.  The case has some magnets that allow the cover (in theory) to be lockedHowever, the design of this case feels rushed.  The iPad Air is thin enough so the volume & on/off controls end up being too recessed to be reached through the cutouts in the cover.  More baffling is an elastic strap (presumably for a pen) stitched into the edge where the cover closes.  Unless you pull the strap out of the way each time you close it, it interferes with closing the case.  Perhaps that will be addressed in an update?The quality of construction is about average, and the fit is only average.Overall, this case will protect your iPad Air, it looks attractive in a business setting, and the cut-outs for the camera and light sensor are in all the right places.

$REVIEW.: Edit 2/2/10: After several months of use, I am revising my review to give this radio 4 stars.  I still think it is the best out there today, but am subtracting a star to account for some poor design flaws on it with the way they integrate with the Bluetooth and Sirius units.The Pioneer AVH-P3100DVD is a touch-screen Double DIN aftermarket car stereo.  It has a 5.8" full color widescreen face, front auxiliary port for connecting an IPod or other device, a front USB port for connecting a USB flash drive, and it can play DVD-R/RW, CD-R/RW, DivX, MP3, WMA and AAC files. ThePioneer AVH-P4100DVD 7-Inch In-Dash Double-DIN DVD Multimedia AV Receiver with  Widescreen Displayis the same exact radio, except it adds a bigger screen (7") by removing the physical buttons to the side, and it adds a subwoofer preamp output.INSTALLATION AND DVD BYPASS: Double DIN means that it is roughly twice the size of a conventional car stereo, so before ordering, you need to make sure it will fit in your car.  The best way to do this is to go to Crutchfield's web site and determine if it will work on your vehicle. The unit itself comes with the receiver, mounting screws, manual, a stylus pen, front mounting cover, and a power cable.  I found it fairly easy to install.  The power cable it comes with just has bare wires coming out of it.  In addition to the radio, you will want to buy a mounting harness and mounting bracket for your vehicle.  The harness looks just like the one that comes with the stereo, but it is designed to clip into the factory harness that's in your vehicle, to make it easy to remove the stereo.  If you don't have one, you'll have to connect all of the wires by hand, and disconnect each one to remove.  The mounting bracket is designed to make sure you radio fits correctly in your specific vehicle.  I purchased both the harness and bracket from Crutchfield.  My only problem with installation, is that it comes with a long green wire that is supposed to be connected to your emergency brake wire.  This is necessary, because the unit has a safety feature that requires the emergency brake to be applied in order to play DVDs.  My emergency brake wire was extremely hard to get to, and once I was able to finally remove the center console and find it, it was buried and almost impossible to access.  I don't suggest doing this, but if you have the same problem and want to get around this issue, or if you want to be able to watch DVDs without having to engage the brake, then you need to connect this wire to an auto relay switch.  Go to Radio Shack and buy a momentary push button switch, part number 275-1548.  Cut the green wire coming out of the radio harness from the receiver, close to the end of it, maybe 5 inches away from that red clip.  Strip the wire, and run it through one of the holes on the relay switch.  You can solder it or just wrap it with electrical tape.  Buy a standard 16 gauge wire from Radio Shack and connect it to the other hole on the switch, then connect the other end of it to a grounded connection on your vehicle.  I just wrapped mine around one of the mounting screws for the radio.  I stuffed this wire out of site under the dash and pull it out when I need it.  Alternatively, you can just cut the green wire directly in half, and use the half you cut instead of having to buy more wire at Radio Shack, but I wanted an extra long wire in case I ever want to move it.  Now, when you play a DVD, the warning screen will come on.  Just press the button on the switch and it will go away, since it tricks the receiver into thinking you have engaged the parking brake. Be sure to check with your local laws, as having the DVD player on while driving or bypassing this may be illegal in your area.  It may also void insurance claims.  I definitely do not recommend ever watching a DVD while driving.FORM FACTOR: The radio itself is beautiful. It fit flush with my dash and looks gorgeous.  There are only a few buttons on the left hand side, and I didn't even realize they were buttons until I looked at them closely.  They control volume, forward/backward, source, mute, and power. I like having these physical buttons, especially for volume and mute.  If I get a phone call or need to hear something, I want to be able to instantly mute the radio without having to fool around with a touchscreen.  It's very nice to have a radio that doesn't have 15 buttons all over it and looks cluttered.  Customization is easy with the radio.  You can select from several different colors, which will change the LED colors on these physical buttons and on the touchscreen menu buttons, so that it matches your car's LED colors.  You can also choose from seven factory background screens, three of which are animated videos.  The animation on the videos is very subtle and doesn't distract you. Plus, when you change the LED color, it actually changes the color of the background videos to match it, which is really cool.  If you don't like these, you can use your own image from a CDR or USB drive. The screen contains a dimmer option, so when you turn on your lights, it automatically dims.  This is pretty nice, but can also be annoying.  I like to use my lights during the day, and while the screen is still readable, it can be hard to see. Fortunately, you can completely adjust the dimmer options through the settings.TOUCHSCREEN: The touchscreen is very easy to navigate and done very well.  The menu system is very intuitive and set up a lot like a computer.  There is a back button and an escape button to get you through the menus.  Seeking through a song can be done in three ways.  You can hold down the physical forward/backward buttons on the unit, you can do the same with the touchscreen forward/backward buttons, or you can use your finger to slide a progress bar back and forth, the same as you would do with a video file on your computer or with an IPod.  This is great because a 30 minute song can start, and I can just press the end of the progress bar with my finger and it will immediately skip to the end of the song (or whatever position I press on the bar).  From what I can tell, it will scroll exactly like a computer and stop at the exact position you touch.  A lot of touchscreens would have "segments" or 5-10 seconds, and stop on whichever segment you came close to.  But with the AVH-P3100, it is segmented into 2 second increments, so you can have much more accurate scrolling.  This is the only instance where I can see the stylus being of any use, but I have fairly large fingers and don't have any problem with the scroll bar.  My main gripe with the touchscreen navigation, is with the up/down scrolling. This is used when navigating radio/satellite stations, song tracks on a CD, or file folders on a USB/IPod.  There is no page up/down feature, so if five folders are displayed and you press the down arrow on the scroll bar, or if you press anywhere below the current position on the scroll bar, it will move the list down by one, instead of down by five.  This is a major oversight in my opinion, and will affect the way you setup your folders.  I have one folder on my USB with 80 subfolders.  That means if I want to scroll through every folder in the list, I have to press the down button 75 times.  Now you can put your finger on it and simply drag the arrow down to move quickly, but it goes kind of fast, and paging through the list would be so much more convenient.  Also, since it only displays five lines at a time, it means you have to scroll one time to view all six of your radio presets.USB: USB is the main reason I purchased this radio, and works well, with a few faults. First, it takes about 10 seconds when I start the car or select the USB source, for it to "read format."  This is possibly because I am using a 8Gb drive with over 1000 songs on it, so it's acceptable to me.  My main problem with the USB feature, is the way it organizes the folders.  They do not appear alphabetically.  I am not sure what method it uses, but like a lot of MP3 audio devices, it just seems to throw them up in the folder list in whatever order it wants.  It will use the same order every time, but you can't trick it by copying a folder you want to appear at the top first, or adding "01, 02, 03, etc" in front of your folders/file names."  There is probably a workaround for this, but I have no idea what it is.  I think it would make more sense if it just listed the folders alphabetically.  It does read ID3 information very well, however it cuts off anything after a certain character limit.  It would be nice if it scrolled sideways through long song titles/artists to show you the full ID3 information, but for about 95% of people's music, this won't be a problem, and for the other 5% you should have enough of the title to figure out what it is.  However if you don't have ID3 tags on your music, it can be a problem.  For example, if you have a folder with 10 songs in it labeled "DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince - Greatest Hits - Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble," and there are no ID3 tags, it is only going to display the first part of the filename until it reaches the character limit.  So your list on the screen will have 10 songs on it that all say something like "DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fr."  Additionally, the USB drive is going to stick out 3" or so from the unit, so unless you remove it every time, you have to be aware of it and careful not to break it off. It doesn't bother me at all though. (Edit - I recently purchasedelago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)for it, which only sticks out about 3mm from the unit and is awesome.  Get this and aKingston 8 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SDC4/8GBand you won't even notice the USB).  The only other problem I've noticed with the USB playback, is that the progress bar is off.  The bar shows time elapsed and time remaining at the same time.  Time remaining is incorrect about 80% of the time.  A song will start up and it will show that it has 6:22 remaining, when it is only a 4:00 song.  Some songs are accurate, but the majority is off anywhere from :30 to 3:00 (Edit - A commenter informed me that this is likely caused by MP3s encoded in Variable Bit Rate (VBR) format.  This is a very plausible explanation and the most likely reason.IPOD: IPod usability is handled exceptionally well.  You can just plug in your iPod using the factory USB into the USB input on the radio.  You don't even need to use the aux input if you want to save that for something else.  I assume you could also plug the iPod in using just the aux input and free up your USB, but I'm not positive.  Unlike USB, the radio accesses iPod songs immediately.  IPod menus look the same as the front of your regular IPod and navigation is easy.  You can either use your iPod to navigate, or it will lock your iPod and you can use the front of the radio.  If you do the latter, your screen mimics an iPod screen and controls.  Unfortunately you can't use the screen to seek like you can with USB, and have to hold down a FORWARD/REVERSE button and it will skip through the song in 16 second increments.  This is a bit slow and it never speeds up, so be warned before trying to get to the end of Freebird.  This is my only problem with it, but I'm not sure if they could have come up with a way around it due to the iPod's design (although this feature may work if you use an iPod touch with it).  It will also display a picture of the album.  The song name is displayed beside the album picture for some reason even though there is plenty of space below the picture.  This means you can only view about 9 characters of the artist name or song title.  Audio quality with the iPod sounded amazing, even better than the USB.  I don't know if that's due to the internal equalizer in the iPod or not, but I can hear a noticeable difference when using an iPod. Navigation of your iPod through the radio, including accessing your play lists and searching for songs/artists, is very quick and intuitive.DVD PLAYBACK:  DVD playback is superb. The video quality is on par with any portable DVD player you would buy.  You cannot tilt the screen, so application is limited, but if you're parked somewhere you can easily enjoy a movie from any seat in the car.  If it's daylight and sunny, you won't be able to see much however. The DVD onscreen menus are nice, and the scroll bar works well for skipping quickly through a movie, even better than a traditional DVD player. There's a HIDE button for quickly removing all onscreen displays, so you don't have to wait several seconds for the menus to time out.SOUND: Sound quality is excellent.  DVDs sound great.  It has three loudness modes which really bring out the sound.  I am using factory speakers with no amplifier, and the built-in Pioneer amplifier makes a huge difference.  It has several pre-set equalizer settings for different types of music.Overall, even if you don't get it at Amazon's current price (40% off SRP), I think this receiver is worth the money.  It really is a beautiful and functional unit, and I always like showing it off to my passengers.  It is too bad there doesn't seem to be a way to update the firmware, because it would be a perfect unit if Pioneer just made a few small changes to the menus.  The unit also does not come with built in Bluetooth, HD Radio, Satellite, or steering wheel controls, but you can add all of these from the products below. I realize Pioneer makes more money by adding these separately, and also keeps costs down on the unit from not including them unless someone wants them, but it would be nice to have built in HD Radio and Bluetooth at least. Stay away from the remote though, it's worthless.Pioneer CD-IU50V USB iPod Cable for Pioneer AVH-P3100DVD- You don't need this, you can use the factory USB cable that came with your iPod. You don't even need to use the auxiliary input.Pioneer GEX-P10HD HD Radio Tuner for Pioneer HD Radio-Ready Head UnitsPioneer GEX-P920XM XM Satellite Tuner- See my comments on the Sirius tuner below.Pioneer CD-SB10 - Sirius Bus Interface for use with Pioneer SAT Radio Ready Headunits and AV ReceiversandSIRIUS SCC1 SIRIUS Connect Universal Tuner(you need BOTH of these to get Sirius radio) - I will write a separate more detailed review on these on their respective pages, but bottom line, is that I am very dissatisfied with the satellite radio tuner. The signal comes in great, and installation was fairly simple.  The tuner works fine as far as I can tell.  My issue is with the incredibly poor way the P3100 interfaces with it. Channel display is awful.  Instead of displaying Station Number, Station Name, Current Artist, and Current Song or Track, like EVERY other satellite radio, the P3100 only gives you 1 single line of usable information for the satellite radio. You have to press an "info" button on the screen and it will then cycle through each piece of information.  Since it has a useless "composer," that means 5 lines of information.  You can never view the artist and song on the same line on your radio.  For example, it will show "Bruce Springsteen."  Hit "INFO" and it will then display "Born to Run."  Hit INFO again and it will then display the station name "E Street Radio." Hit it again and it will display the channel number "S010."  Hit it again and it will display "NO COMPOSER."  Finally hitting it one more time will go back to the artist name.  I don't have to tell you how annoying this is.  The frustrating thing is it has the data fields and lines available to display all of that info at once, it just doesn't and uses that for empty space.  Incredibly poor design.  But I can live with it in order not to have an external radio taking up space and my cigarette adapter.  I assume the XM tuner has the same issues.  There are other issues with the design (like not even displaying station names in your programmed memory list), but if you just listen to a few channels it will do.Pioneer CD BTB200 - Cellular phone Bluetooth adapter- This is designed almost as badly as the Sirius adapter, but the hands free works great and it beats having to hold a phone.  I use my actual phone to dial out instead of the radio, since it is much faster than trying to bring up a phone number through the radio's built-in directory.  Also, unless you have rigged up a handbrake bypass as I described above, you can only receive calls and can't use it to dial out unless the car is in park.Pioneer ND-BC2 Universal Rear View Camera

$review_text.: I've been using Pinnacle for over a decade, upgrading regularly. But I'm done with it now.I downloaded the patch to upgrade Release 17.4 to Release 17.5. It came with a free plug-in for SonicFire. The patch installed, but the plug-in for SonicFire would not.When I tried to get support from Pinnacle for the failed installation, they invited me to purchase a support ticket. Hello? That's a hidden-fee or installation charge. You have to pay them to fix their mistakes.Three times I got the same canned message that &#34;if there's a product defect, there will be no charge&#34; -- followed by instructions for purchasing a support ticket.I could not get through to a human being. I could not get a human being to acknowledge that they sent out a defective patch/plug-in installation.As far as I'm concerned, their customer support is worse than incompetent -- it's deliberately rude.Based on this experience, I can only assume that Corel/Pinnacle doesn't understand public relations very well. It looks to me that they see their customers as nothing more than cash cows to be milked.I did finally solve my problem. I uninstalled it and switched to Adobe Premiere Pro. The learning curve is a little steep, but I trust Adobe a lot more than Corel/Pinnacle.

Both times on Amazon.The first one had weird clicking noises every time I backed up my mac with time machine. I mean, the noises were really disturbing. The design is very attractive but it's functionality is horrible. What good is a hard drive if you can't trust it with your data?. I thought, maybe I got a bad lemon.So I bought another one, which had the same horrible noises plus it actually corrupted my time machine backups. I couldn't copy my files back to my mac because of some finder -36 error.Stay away from this drive. Don't let it's cheap price fool you. Get an iomega drive. I have 2 of them and so far, thanks God, no problems.Thanks for reading my review.

$REVIEW.: My older TV doesn't will not output Dolby digital sound and my older receiver does not have HDMI connections, making it impossible to enjoy the 1080p picture and Dolby 5.1 sound that the Roku 3 offers.  This ViewHD Converter lets me enjoy both using component connections and an optical cable.... and it does it perfectly well.  Buy it quickly if you can find one for sale and  are relatively happy with your 5 to 10 year old TV and sound system,... because these ViewHD Converters are rarely available in the US.March 2014 update: An alternative is this ViewHD Premium HDMI to HDMI + Audio (sPDIF + RAC L/R) Audio Extractor | Converter, but it still requires an HDMI input on your TV, but the sound can be through either a stereo or optical cable for Dolby 5.1 sound. I have both ViewHD products and they work great with the Roku 3.

I had to install the software several times because for some reason the computer would not take it


Later I found that you have to disable your firewall to allow Eye-Fi access to your modem not your computer


What bugged me the most is that you have to login to their website and type your IP address AND password for your internet modem

I am always very cautious about internet security and these issues did not reassured me at all.I installed the software just to be able to see how it worked and it runs almost at the same speed it would as if I just inserted the card on the computer.The difference is that I had to disclose IP address and password and disable my firewall every time I use Eye Fi
To me, it is not worth it to sacrifice security for "convenience"Unistalling it is a pain because the uninstall function does not run as smoothly as it should so I had to basically erase ALL the files manually.If you are not a "computer geek" I would not recommend this product.

$review_text.: I have had this BD player for a few months now and am quite satisfied with my purchase
That being said, I still don't feel like I have had enough time to figure everything out on the player
For instance, I haven't yet figured out why I can't pause my blu-rays for more than a few minutes without getting sent back to the main menu and having to go through all the previews again


One other thing I don't like and this may be specific to the discs themselves and not the blu-ray, is that it takes FOREVER to get through the previews to get to the main menu


There seems to be random movies that I can get straight to the menu but most will force me to watch every preview..
unless I skip through each individual preview


BLEH


Also switching from the blu-ray menu to the player menu where the apps are available tends to take a really long time


Lately I have had a few times where I am trying to get through Blockbuster onDemand menus and the player freezes and I have to restart, but I assume that is typical of technology
Overall this is a good unit.

$review_text.: This does the job.  I cannot tell the difference when a device is plugged in through this or directly to the tv.  It is easy to change devices.  I really like having the front input because my tv does not have that.  My only complaint, which is minor, is that this box is very light and can be easily tipped. If I put it on the bottom of my stack of boxes it would not be a problem, but because the footprint of this box is so small it would not be a good base for the other boxes.  Still, this is a solid product at a good price.
$SUMMARY.: good

$REVIEW.: These worked decently while skiing to keep the interior dry
 I say decently because it still had a tendency to fog up, but we had to keep opening the door due to issues with the GoPro itself and you can only expect it to absorb so much moisture

 A bigger problem was they are not particularly easy to fit in the case, we had to cut them in half and stuff them in different places

 Every time you open the door they'd want to fall out and at the end of the trip they were all falling apart.

$review_text.: I own 3 of the Meike battery grips and I've not had a single issue. I use them on my Canon T3, 60D and 6D. My original thinking was, even if they stopped working after a couple of years and I had to buy replacements I would still be ahead of the game but that has not been the case and I'm way ahead of the game. I just bought this particular grip with my 6D and it works like the others- perfectly. I've owned the T3 model for 2 years and the 60D for 1 year and I honestly could not be happier. The Canon OEM is $209. Save yourself $168 and use it for some more fun gear. I always preach that one should never go cheap on camera equipment but these are absolutely exceptions to that rule.In a nutshell- performs exactly as the OEM at a fraction of the price. Period.

$REVIEW.: I wsn't sure if this case would fit my Nikon D7000 with 50-300mm lens attached, but it does fit
Actually it is a perfect fit.Very happy with everything about this case

The suspension system is cool and does just what it says it will do


It is only a little bit annoying to pull you camera out of it if you have a lens hood on.A shorter lens doesn't fit quite as well, but with the suspension system it doesn't really matter because the camera still sits right at the top of the bag, not boucing around inside


It really is a good design.

$REVIEW.: This case rates a perfect 5 stars for meeting my criteria in a case for my new Kindle Classic (the tiny new $79 model).  See below for use with my Kindle Touch (that just arrived today).My 5 priorities for a Kindle Classic Case were:1. Economical - Paying $40 for a case makes perfect sense for my $600 iPad2, but is nuts for an $80 reader.2. Compact and Lightweight -  one of the core benefits of the new Kindle or Touch is the light weight and small size that lets me take it anywhere without hassles.  A bulky thick case defeats the purpose.3. Flexible binding -  I need to be able to bend the cover behind the kindle so I can read with one hand.4. Not cheap looking or feeling - Workmanship should be ok, and if it looks and feels like leather that's a bonus.5. Protects the screen from scratches and the Kindle from drops.The Acase rates a perfect 5 for 5.  I got it for about half what I thought I would have to spend.  It is as lightweight as it could be and still protects the Kindle.The binding folds easily backwards, and I can fold the soft magnetic clasp back too.  Workmanship is great, and it appears to be soft suede inside, and soft leather outside.  I believe it really is leather, it just doesn't smell as much like a new pair of shoes as some other case I have. It is close enough that I can't tell, and looks and feels classy.Finally, the magnetic clasp holds tight, and the clamps and elastic on the inside fit my Kindle 4 perfectly without interfering with any functions.  Perfect for me.NOTE on this ACASE and the KINDLE TOUCH: I just got in my Kindle Touch today (a gift for a friend).  The Touch fits in fine, but because it is slightly larger in all dimensions than the Classic, it is tight. There is not as much protection on the open edge or top.UPDATE, ACASE now has a new model just a bit larger for the Kindle Touch.  See the 3rd comment to this review.

$review_text.: I have been using this case for about 1 week now and am quite pleased. I wanted a "folio" style case that also had built-in capability to act as a stand with multiple viewing angles, and this has fit the bill nicely.  The iPad fits snugly into the case with two elastic bands folding over the internal corners.  Easy access to all controls and inputs.  A couple of notes:Viewing "stand":  The design has four pairs of horizontal ridges on the internal face of the left folio cover that is used to hold the ipod in the various viewing positions.  Nice design that works well as long as the iPad is on a solid surface or is supported equally on both sides (eg. it does not work well if you but the case on just one leg while sitting down as the edges of the case bend down and the iPad will not stay standing, but if in your lap with each side of the case on one of your legs, it is perfect).Material:  While well-designed, it is not the highest quality material.  No animal lost hide in the making of this case!  And while it looks good (I bought the black case), it certainly does not match the high style of the iPad.  That said, I knew for $25.95 that I wouldn't get an Apple-quality look or feel.  But I most definitely got the functionality I was looking for, and it is "good enough" in the looks category.At some point I may look for a leather case if it can match the Acase functionality, but overall this product is excellent and exactly what I wanted and expected...for the price.

$REVIEW.: In the ear as I have been finding out are not so great for your ears.Not that I based my stars on that fact above.The sound is nothing to complain about. The bass is good, when you get these to seal in your ear, which then causes a bit of stress until you adjust. They worked well for exercising but when you start to sweat you will have to push them back into your ears.I was standing up one day from my recliner and the cord must have caught my food or toe and as I stepped away the right headphone cord came apart where the cords come together. It was so easy in fact that it made me doubt the build quality instantly. Normally a cord of the small size like that can trip you up, but this just came apart like the magsafe adapter on Apple laptops.Now I find it is  used as a one ear piece whilst working so I can hear what I need on the computer and all of the human interaction required at work can take place as well.The sound is great, but the fit in the ears to make it seems a bit tight. They do give you addition ear sizes and a wax cleaner. I certainly won't ever buy in ear style phones ever again.Update: These were broken by having the cord come unattached from the in ear piece.All in ear headphones are quite bad for your ears, extremely so to the point I have stopped using any in ear phones after these broke. I was looking for a new pair. Not anymore.Though I personally do not enjoy these ear phones anymore, they did have a proper sound with decent bass notes.They do sound nice and have a case with ear piece options... but the damage they do to my ears is enough for me to never use in ear phones again.

$REVIEW.: I sooooo badly wanted to like this product.  Received it on June 30 after getting my pre-order.  Installed all my favorite Android apps and even a few new ones.  Was absolutely loving the product----with one exception.  The overheating is a very real issue.  I like the tablet so much (gorgeous display) that I have been putting up with the overheating reboots.  One of the apps I installed is System Tuner (from Google Play).  That app reports the CPU temps.  Mine would consistently be at 185 degrees plus, with the top temp seen (just before an overheat reboot) of 210.6 degrees F.  That's water boiling/egg cooking HOT!So I was putting up with the heat and re-boots because I liked the tablet so much.  However, this morning, it did another overheat reboot, only this time, it did not reboot.  It powered off and back on, and powered up only to the little pretty green Acer logo on bootup, but that's as far as it would go.  Let it sit for 1/2 hour like this, but nothing.  Turn off and back on multiple times but same hang at the Acer logo.  Tried a hard reset (the little reset button hole by the USB power port), but same result every time.So, back it went today.  Fortunately, it died within three weeks of delivery, so still within the Amazon return period.  If this product did not have the overheat issue and had not died, I would have enthusiastically given it a full five star review.  However, for a $449 product (yes, that's what I paid on pre-order), for this to overheat consistently and finally die within three weeks, I have to warn that this is a defective product by its very design.I would highly urge anyone who purchases this to install System Tuner available on Google Play and check the CPU temps carefully.  Your product will not last long when it overheats to the point of reboot consistently.  It will fail shortly just as mine has.Thanks all, sorry Amazon and Acer.  Fix the heat issue and you have a very, very nice product.  Until then, I will stay away.  I did not replace but went with refund, as others have been reporting the same heat issues with this unit and would fully expect the replacement to have the same issue and fail again.Update:  7/30/2012I've seen a couple reviews following mine on here that state the heat is not bad, even citing an outside case temp of 113 F, which I would agree with.  The case only gets rather warm, however...again, I would HIGHLY recommend installing the System Tuner from Google Play and checking your actual internal CPU temperature sensor readings that are built into the Tegra 3 CPU.  As agreed, my case got warm too...not hot, but the internal temps were the issue.  In either case if yours is getting hot or not, the app is free and it won't cost you anything but a little time to know for sure.  Good luck all...again, I agree, an excellent unit if not for the heat.  I've now ordered a new ASUS TF700T so will provide another update in a few weeks to let you know how that compares with the A700.Update 10/25/2012:I said I would post another update on the ASUS TF700T.  It has none of the overheat issues of the Acer A700.  The warmest I have ever seen the CPU temp with the same utility is 105 degrees F.  The display of the ASUS is better, and I now have the latest Android Jellybean OS.  I also bought the dock for the ASUS....very happy now!  Only two pros for the Acer A700 over the ASUS TF700T.  First, the Acer was $50 cheaper.  Second, the speakers on the TF700T are REALLY lame.  The Acer A700 sound was magnitudes better through the speakers.  Very glad that I returned the Acer and bought the ASUS.  I've had the ASUS now for almost three months.

$review_text.: First the fundamentals: this unit works--it stores and plays 400 DVDs with very good picture and sound quality; but there are so many little things that make it hard to use that the only reason to recommend this over another mega-changer is the price.The biggest problem is the amount of your time this unit wastes.As other reviewers have noted, with the cover art installed, it takes over 1.5 seconds to display the next item when scrolling up or down


 That really adds up in a 400-disc player


 You can cut down on this by alpha-sorting the folders and scrolling rapidly without having the unit display the titles as you go, but even with this it still can take over a minute to find the disc you want
 Definitely longer than when I had my DVDs on the shelf.It is also very annoying that the player locks-out the stop button during the FBI warning, so if you start playing a disc unintentionally, you have to wait until the warning is done before you can go back
 That can easily add a minute or two.Which leads to another big frustration: an extremely bad remote control
 There are lots of little buttons that are very difficult to tell apart
 Some of the buttons can kill a viewing experience if hit by accident (eg., if you hit disc skip you need to sit through the entire FBI warning for the DVD you are moving to, and then again through the one you are watching, and then you have to find your place again


 A potential 5-minute delay because your finger slipped in the dark).There is also a strange bug that causes the unit to sometimes start playing the current disc when you hit the power button


 (There is a feature to do this, but I have it turned off)

 To continue the ongoing theme of this review, when this happens, you need to sit through the entire FBI warning before you can go select the disc you want to view.Two features that I've seen mentioned about this unit (though not by Sony) are not present at all

 First, some places refer to this as a 400+1 disc changer
 There is no 401st slot; you need to remove a disc to put the 401st in

 Second, I saw one site say that this unit could play both sides of a DVD
 This is not true.I have ended up printing out a paper list of the installed DVDs and their slot numbers, and I navigate using the dial on the base unit


 I control the unit during play using a universal remote that doesn't include any changer functions.Not an ideal solution, but not bad for around $350 delivered.

$REVIEW.: I will try not to be a crank (my humor) but give this radio a good review for: 1.) best sound for music and voice for its size, 2.) variety of ways to power it, and even a hand crank to charge it up (takes 90 cranks to get it going for just a half hour,) two AA batteries or the NOT INCLUDED AC ADAPTER (don't forget to order it - its a rare type and 4.5v) and, 3.) fine tuning knob really helps bring in those hard to get stations


All in all I'm very pleased, it is my favorite portable radio
I wish it had plug-ins for an iPod or an iPhone, but it doesn't

Come on radio people - Please realize that lots of people have their music on mp3 players now, We need more mp3 plug-ins on our electronics we buy, especially portable products (HINT HINT.)If you just need a portable radio, this is a great one

$review_text.: I liked it EXCEPT that whenever I would try to use scroll bars, drag-drop, or resize, it generated an annoying pop-up error message
 I spent perhaps 1.5 hours on the phone with tech support, who ultimately could not get rid of it


 The first support person (in the Philippines) ended up "closing" the case (though the problem wasn't fixed) by telling me to scan for viruses
 Since the problem was related to a .dll and occurred only with the touchpad, I dutifully did the scan but expected no change

 No change is what I got.The second time I called tech support (someone else in the Philippines), he concluded that I was missing a Microsoft download, and I would have to work with Microsoft rather than Logitech to fix the problem


 Fat chance
 I did install the recommended download anyway, but it made no difference.So, it's going back

 Too bad, because I liked the design


 But this is a problem I can't circumvent or tolerate, and I'm tired of nonanswers from support
Plus, they say I have to work with Microsoft to fix it, so they wouldn't want to talk to me anyway.


$SUMMARY.: Never got rid of error message--called support twice

$review_text.: We have been using this for several months now and I have no complaints. For the cost and a brand name that I'm unfamiliar with it has been a good boom box so far.UPDATE: 1-30-2014 Well the tuning radio stations sucks. And the speakers just can't give you anything very loud. So, I'd have to say I wouldn't buy again. My earlier review was from me only using it once, my family was who was using it. I've used it many time now and don't like it.

$review_text.: I know there are tons of choices for tempered glass screen protectors, but I always for for Tech Armor.  Here's why:1. I've used them on several products such as an iPhone 5, 5S, and now my Galaxy Note 32. I know that when I have an issue, they go out of their way to make it right.3. Going with someone else is a crapshoot - if it works, you're good, however, several things can go wrong:- The shipper is in another country and it takes forever- The company doesn't package the screen protector well and it shatters- The product started off well, but then it has problems later onHere is my personal experience with the Galaxy Note 3 Tech Armor Ballistic screen protector.  I received the product in perfect condition and it was well packaged.  It fit well on my Note 3 but a few days later, one side of the protector started to lift from the screen.  I think this was due to the Spigen case I had on it and the pressure it was exerting on the sides of the screen protector.I contacted Tech Armor right away and within 24 hours, they shipped me a new screen protector.  Some companies ship their replacements in containers that are more prone to damage.  Not Tech Armor.  I got the new tempered glass screen protector in the same container as my first one a few days after my replacement request.I've installed the screen protector and it is exceptional.  Samsung couldn't have put better glass on this device.  I'm glad I didn't go with anyone else and I know exactly who I'll go with for a screen protector for a Galaxy Note 4.

$REVIEW.: I went to J&R; with the thought of buying this off-the-shelf
But their sound wall with headphones changed my mind


I heard this one and I was almost immediately disappointed

They have a very rounded, muffled tone that lacks punch and crispness


The ONLY good thing about them is the big ear comfort.But then I ended up buying Sennheiser HD 218 after listening to many

They aren't big, but provide equal comfort


The sound is much better for just 10 extra dollars.

$REVIEW.: I received just what was described. I haven't used all it's features yet so I cannot give the most thorough review. I had previously been using a very old television so this is leaps and bounds better. Even my very old dvd player works better attached to this tv. All the ports are on the back right (if looking at the screen) with a on/off button on bottom right. Instructions for set up are easy to follow and the remote is easy to use.

$REVIEW.: I replaced my Garmin Nuvi 650 that I had for over 2 years with Magellan 1440 last week and I'm happy with the performance so far.My Garmin served me well for over 2 years until it the touch screen stopped responding. I went to Costco to buy a replacement and saw this unit for $79.00 so decided to give it a try.First thing that I noticed are the differences between the Nuvi 650 and this new unit. Please remember that I'm comparing a new Magellan unit to a 2 1/2 year old Nuvi so there might be some improvement on the new Garmin units.1. Speaker: Garmin speaker is a lot better than this unit. I hear static on this unit when I adjust the volume to its highest. It's still understandable when you have the radio on but not as clear as my Garmin unit.2. LCD: I mount the units in the vent using a third party vent mount. My Garmin is a lot clearer even when the sun hits the screen. Magellan LCD are clear on non sunny day and is hard to see once the sun is on it's highest. Anyway, the instruction is clear enough that I don't need to look at the screen.3. Voice: I like the Garmin voice better as it is more human like. After a week of use, I'm now getting used to the Magellan voice and instruction so it not a big deal for me anymore. Garmin will say something like "On right" while Magellan says "Keep to the right"4. Direction: I like the way Magellan gives the direction ahead of time and tells me which side will be my next turn.  I also like the way Magellan gives you another reminder when you are approaching a turn or an exit and the bell it sounds when it is time to turn.  Garmin tells you the next move at around 1 mile and around .2 miles but I will have to listen to the street name given or check the GPS constantly to see if I'm on the right corner as it does not give you anymore signal when it is time to turn. Of course this is an older product.5. Re-Route: When you missed a turn Garmin will say "Re-calculating" while it calculate your next turn. This unit does not do that, it will simply recalculate and change its course. At first, I was confused as I was waiting for the GPS to acknowledge a missed turn but I'm used to it now. I feel that it is actually better as my passenger will not know that I missed a turn if they are not paying attention to the road. With Garmin once they hear the word re-calculating they know already that I missed a turn.6. Navigation: It seem to give me the same instruction as my Garmin. It now have the 125 freeway as I have the latest map so that is a plus. Also, Magellan shows you 4 route option (fastest, shortest, most use of freeways, least use of freeways). Garmin also have these but it only shows you the option you select in the settings menu.7. Junction View: I don't have this on my Garmin. I have not really looked at the junction view as the direction is already clear and tells me in advance which lane to stay. I guess when I go into an unfamiliar place, I may look into this screen.8. Address Input: Magellan input screen is a little slow to register. At first I always ended up selecting a different street as I type faster than the unit. You will hear the unit say the letter but it still does not register on the screen so you end up typing the next letter which the unit will recognize and give you a totally different address selection. And when the selection appears, it appears fast that when you are trying to type the whole street or city, you end up selecting from the selection so you have to hit the back button to redo your selection. I believe this is a bug because the voice confirms the letter you type while the text on the screen does not. Example is when you intend to type FOURTH the unit will say the word F.O.U.R while it does not register let say "U" so you end up with FOR on the screen and it will show street starting with FOR... i.e. (FORTY, etc..) and since the screen shows the selection too fast, and you are still typing the rest of the letter, you will end up selecting a different street. I have to slow down a little in entering addresses to make sure I get to the right address.9. Destination Reached: Magellan tells you that you have arrived then reads and displays the address that you have which I like. My old unit does not do this and I sometimes have to check my note or go back to previous screen to check the house number.10. Satellite signal: Satellite reception if fast. First boot took me around 20 seconds to acquire signal. It is usually the same when I have to turn off the unit and turn it on again on a different location. If you turn on the machine on the same location you turned it off, you usually get signal in a couple of seconds. My Garmin takes at least 3 minutes or at least a minute if turned on the same location.11. POI search: Fast when you use the category option as it first narrows down the select to location near you (around 5 mile radius). It then gives you option to expand the search if you want a longer radius. When you use the spell name, it takes at least a minute or 2 depending on what you are searching.12. Display arrangement: I like the garmin screen better, you can easily see your direction, speed, and ETA. You will have to toggle through the display selection on the lower left from Magellan if you want to see these option. Maybe I got use to seeing all those option from the last 2 1/2 years that I am using garmin that is why I continue to look at those data. If you only use Magellan or if this is your first GPS, you will not notice the difference.One thing I noticed is that when I first enter an address outside the city where I first used it, it does not show me the range of number that I want. It shows 3250-8000 when I need a 3007 number. When I use the POI (the address is for a business) it shows the 3007 address. After I select the POI and create the route to that address, I tried entering the address again manually and it was there and available. The range increase from 3250-8000 to 1-8000. When I looked over online I saw on one page (I don't have the link anymore) where it says that when you enter a new location and could not find the address, you can first create a route on that city by selecting the city center from POI then all the address range will be available. It looks to me that it is a bug and this is a workaround. So, far I was not able to replicate that problem. Also, I have upgraded my firmware and map after I experience that problem so the update may have fixed it.I will continue to put this unit to test and if it works as expected, I will add the traffic link cord to also get the traffic reports.Conclusion:  I cannot attest to the durability of the unit as of this time as I only have it for the week but for the price, I recommend this product. The directions are clear and it will take you to the address you tell it to go. The screen may be hard to see but the spoken direction is clear enough for me that I don't look at the screen anyway. Another thing is that I have put a protective screen on my Garmin. This may have also reduce the glare from the sun. I will try installing a protective screen on this unit and see if that will make the screen more viewable.

$review_text.: This drive is AWESOME and smokes away the products I have tried in the past.  My comparison is with the Crucial C300, the OCZ Vertex 2, and the OCZ Vertex 3.  My test bed was a macbook pro 17" with 8gb ram and a 2.3ghz quad core i7 processor.My search started for new drive when I realized that 256gb was not going to cut it for me for much longer....external drives are great but not something I want around me all of the time.  Yes I looked into removing my superdrive on my mac and adding a second hard drive...nope...still like to have that DVD Burner available once in a while.  :).  The mac was using the OCZ vertex 3 for the longest time in SATA 3 with a negotiated link speed of SATA 6Gb/s.  The write speed as reported by Blackmagic Disk Speed test was about 220 mb/s and the read speed about 280 mb/s,  Not horrible...I finally decided to take the plunge and buy a larger SSD drive and much to my surprise this Sandisk extreme 480gb was priced perfectly....I thought I had a lightning deal...  Amazon, Thank you!.Here goes:  I removed the Vertex 3 from my mac and put it in a external enclosure.  I then simply installed the Sandisk Extreme in the macbook pro...it fits perfectly and slides in with a bit of room to spare..which is exactly what you want.  Next step - connect the external enclosure and boot from the Vertex....  All fine...the mac detected the new hard drive and asked me to initialize it...which I did and created one partition.  I then used a free software Carbon Copy Cloner to image my old vertex to the new SanDisk - took a while but all of my system was now imaged to the SanDisk.TEST TIME:  Imaging done - I rebooted the macbook pro and disconnected my Vertex in the external enclosure.  All is well thus far..no complaints...things seem a little sluggish.  Did not realize that it is the first boot after imaging..things will be  a tiny bit sluggish for a few minutes.  :)  Gave the Macbook Pro her time to get adjusted to the new hardware...made sure all of my data had transferred and shut the machine down.  Rebooted after a few minutes and ran Blackmagic Speed Test again:The RESULT: 225+ mb/s write speeds and a ASTOUNDING off the chart 507+mb/s read speeds... I have uploaded an image.  This was run using a 5gb file as a stress test.I know there are tons of other tresting tools out there, but I like Blackmagic for its simplicity...Conclusion - This is a AWESOME drive and worth getting if you are considering upgrading your macbook pro and or any other system you may have.  5/5 STARS.ps...quick note for you MAC users: SanDisk does offer downloadable iso files that can be burned to CD so you can boot from the CD and update firmware on your drive....one of the few manufacturers that pays a bit more attention to the MAC community.
$SUMMARY.: This drive SMOKES the competition.....MAC test...

Clear audio, fast cd load, immpecable A2DP transmission with my Motorola Milestone/Droid and excellent handsfree function. The front Piano black polish look great!!!FM radio reception is OK, no problems with this. Installation was very quick because i replaced my old Sony MEX-R5 stereo car, and their interfaces connectors are exactly the same. MEX-R5 has more EQ options, has 7 bands EQ and this MEX-BT3800U only 3, but the sound is clear and great with Xplod EQ.

$review_text.: I bought this Western Digital My Passport 1 TB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive - WDBBEP0010BBK-NESN (Black) instead of the one that states it is specifically for Mac. The box said that to use THIS external hard drive with OS-X on a Mac it would have to be reformatted. It took me about a minute and a half to find my Macbook's Disk Utility and explore how to use it to reformat this external hard drive. About ten seconds later the reformat was complete. I then transferred a folder containing 58GB of music files--my entire iTunes Media folder containing my entire iTunes library of tunes--from my Macbook's hard drive to this external hard drive by simply clicking on the folder and dragging it over onto my hard drive. It COPIED over (not just TRANSFERRED over) at the rate of about 1.4GB per minute. I left the iTunes app itself in the Applications folder of my MacBook's hard drive. I then ran the iTunes app from there, directly accessing my tunes from the external hard drive. It runs at least as fast this was as it did when everything was on my MackBook's hard drive. I now have 58 more GB of free space on my Macbook's hard drive--just like that. I could not possibly be happier at this early stage of owning and using this external hard drive. I will amend this review after a few months and again after a year and more to comment on the reliability and durability of this external hard drive.EDITED: December 18, 2012:  I've now been using my WD Passport daily for 5.5 months without a hitch. I used to unmount it and disconnect it after each time I used it, but for a few months now I haven't touched it. I just leave it connected all the time. No problems.

The 7" screen is large enough (especially for you older folks who need reading glasses) so you don't have to squint to see the map.  The voice is loud and clear.  It works better than the one that came with my car.  Tested the Garmin units and did not like the small screens and poor voice quality.  The only complaint I have about the Roadmate 1700 is the short battery life (you can't take it hiking unless you can charge it up after about 15 minutes).

I own not one not two but three lacie little big disks a 2 bay 2.5 inch device.  with an insanely whiney fan.  that must be disconnected to be lived with. I also own a seagate 2.5 inch thunderbolt adapter that fits any smaller ssd 256gb or less but does not like 512gb ssds. I also own this pegasus j4. I read the other review that it does not boot but there was new firmware so I took a shot.  THIS DOES NOT BOOT!! REPEAT NO BOOTING!!!!  I never cease to be amazed how a company that makes great gear in this case promise makes great thunderbolt gear in the form of the pegasus r4 and r6.  Then they shoot their foot by issuing this unit.  LOOKS great fan is quiet .  Stacks perfectly with a mac mini .  Well  in the 2012 mac mini the stock hdd is a slow 5400rpm hdd. You are not allowed to swap it with an aftermarket ssd.  As that voids the warranty. So this item would be perfect if it boots.  IT DOES NOT BOOT. REPEAT IT DOES NOT BOOT.  What moron would make this product this way?  I could forgive them if the other promise pegasus gear did not boot , but all of it boots.  Every one they sell boots except this one.  I wish I could talk to the CEO and the head engineers and ask them WTF were they thinking making a non bootable product. At least make it clear that IT DOES NOT BOOT!!
$SUMMARY.: Does not boot making it a sad joke.

Maybe it is not supposed to work on it, but I could not get a reply from the manufacturer about it, so it get's 2 stars for not working properly AND the manufacturer not helping me figure out why.

$review_text.: I purchased two 64gb cards earlier this month.  One to use on a Samsung Galaxy S3 and the other on an ASUS Transformer T100.  While I have not used the one for the T100 yet, I'm a bit concerned about using it.For the past couple of days my Galaxy S3 started acting strange when listening to music, suddenly the music would stop playing and the music app would become unresponsive.  I thought a reboot would do the trick, but no, even then the phone was unresponsive, but if the SD card was out, the phone would be just fine.  Upon checking the Storage option under Settings, the SD card section would forever stay as &#34;Computing....&#34;Today, I took the card out, put it in my computer, verified the card is still in its exFAT formatting and tried to run CHKDSK.  Needless to say, CHKDSK failed with the message &#34;The disk check could not be performed because Windows can't access the disk&#34;.  Hmmmm...bad card already?  So I tried an SD card tested app on my phone, halfway through the read/write test (a 300MB test file), the app could no longer read the card with the message &#34;Card cannot be accessed, please mount card&#34;.Great, yet another bad microSD card.  First it was 2 SanDisk cards and now a Transcend.  What gives?  Are manufacturers that pressed for sales that they simply let QA slip?To top it off, I tried going to the Transcend website before writing this review (2/8/14 8:38pm ET) and the site is down.  Quality service Transcend, quality service.  I'm just going to contact Amazon and return the card.

$review_text.: These are small form speakers designed for a mixture of Film and music. They are the best looking and sounding speakers you will get in this price range. You get what you pay for and with these speakers, forty to fifty dollars is a very small price to pay for the sound you get. Just consider that these  speakers will not blow you away with clarity. They are for easy listening through medium loud sound. Not for gaming though.

$review_text.: I have a 24" iMac that came with 1Gig of memory. After using it for about 3 months I discover applications that crash for reasons unknown after an upgrade to the OSX Tiger upgrade. I concluded after looking into the problem that OSX has a problem with memory management. When all the memory gets used up by either leaky programs or a fault in the OS, applications get flaky. So I've increased my memory to 4Gig. Now the applications aren't crashing. So this was my fix for a bigger problem nobody seems to understand. The memory took 5 mins to install and worked perfectly. And it seemed incredibly well priced.

$review_text.: I love this camera. I would rather have the 10 MP version, but I got this as a gift. It's really slim, and the battery charges in less than an hour and stays full for weeks. I use my camera almost everyday. I like all the photo options, and they all work really well. The manual and software/cords are all great. The only thing I don't really like is the battery charger. I think if it had a retractable plug, instead of a detachable cord, it would be better. Everything else about this is great. The picture quality is also great.

$REVIEW.: It's hard to find detailed info about this laptop, even from Dell's website.  The specs certainly measure up to the competion at Amazon's fantastic price, and if you order it similarly equipped direct from Dell expect to pay about $150 more.  Other reviews of the computer have been helpful, but compare carefully to other small notebooks on the market before you buy. (I returned this one.)LIKES:Overall fit and finish: excellent, although a fingerprint magnetPrice: best 1.3ghz dual core notebook bargain at the moment (expect to pay about $100 more for comparable performance)Excellent screen, although only 11.6" compared to competition (see below)Windows 7DISLIKES:A 3 cell battery would have kept the sleek, slim &lt;1" profile, while the included 6 cell battery sticks out akwardly from the bottom of the case at the rear of the unit, doubling the thickness and making it difficult to slide the computer into a sleeve, computer bag, etc. (see photo.)No HDD indicator light!2 of 3 USB ports and the power port are on the right side of the case, right where I use my mouse!Card reader only accepts 3 types of cards.HDMI output only, no VGA.4Gb of memory is great, but it's configured suboptimally in single channel configuration instead of dual channel (a very minor impact on performance.)Weight of the notebook with included 6 cell battery is 3.40 lbs...still fairly light, but this is not clearly spelled out in the description.A 12.1" screen could have easily been installed in the same space.Touchpad buttons are difficult to activate with normal finger pressure.No "upgrade" access panels anywhere on the unit; would require signficant disassembly.Large and heavy power AC power adapter, 3 prong plug.I ultimately returned this laptop due to the akward battery issue (the 3 cell version does not have this issue, but I need the 6 cell.)  The depth of the computer at the battery is a full 2 inches, and it does not fit neatly in a travel bag in any way.  I purchased an ASUS UL30A-X5 which is a great value as well but $170 more.  It offers higher specs (13.3" LCD, full core2 duo, 500GB HDD, 4gb DDR3 memory) in a slightly larger footprint, but with it's smaller power supply weighs only 2oz more than the 11z.  The ASUS UL20A is also a good model.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased a Asus Eee Pad Transformer. I looked at the price of the keyboard and could not see the value in it. Any kind of case or cover renders the keyboard useless. I purchased this and it connects via an adapter just fine without removeing it from the case. I fits into the hard cover I purchased with the Eee Pad without a problem. I type lots of reports on this little keyboard and love it. The $150 dollars I saved will be used for other purposes. I am so glad that I did not purchase the attachable keyboard. I would have to remove the cover constantly where with this little item, I simply plug it in and type. Make sure you purchase the USB adapter for your Asus Eee Pad. It makes the Transformer a full blown blazing fast laptop in minature. And definately get this keyboard....

$review_text.: Pros:These headphones sound AMAZING, the bass is crazy and treble is crystal clear. The around the ear design blocks out sound really well. Everything is muffled when they're on, then you cant hear anything when you have music playing. I can sit in the same room with the TV going and not hear a thing when i listen to my music. I have done my homework sitting on the couch with my mom watch the TV and i can just sit there and do my homework and not be distracted(im 16 fyi). Its really amazing how well these things allow me to focus. They also look awesome! Walking around with these things around your head or neck makes anyone look good. I like how you can swivel each side as well as tilt it. Helps with wearing them comfortably.Cons:None of these are major flaws, just annoyances or shortcomingsThe headphones feel a little cheap. Its all plastic, swiveling them makes a squeaking sound and it can feel like you going to snap it when you tilt it a little too far. The volume control on the wire is a little hard to use. You cant feel for it and just change it. The wheel barely sticks out from its casing. Making it hard to change the volume with only holding it in one hand. I also don't understand the extension cable. If you take it off, the existing cable coming from the headphone is too short to do anything with unless you stick your ipod in your shirt pocket around your chest. I cant even sit at a table with my laptop without using the extension cable. its much too short.It would suck pretty bad to lose that extension because the headphones would become useless pretty quick. With the extension cable, there is a bit of excess when you stick your ipod in your pocket. I cram the extra 4-5 inches in my pocket. Which is sort of annoying.The cons may look bigger then the pros, but there not that big of a deal. They really aren't. I am practically in love with these things.When they retail for 70$ on skull candy's website, i got them for 40$ on amazon. Nice chunk of chain. I bought a 2.1 system for my sister in apartment at college with the extra 30$. I love her :DOnce you wear these, you will never wear apple ear buds or cheap headphones again with out making a groan. They are simply that good. Skull candy are the best brand, dont look anywhere else for DJ styled headphones.

$REVIEW.: I got this for 69/100 of a Ben Franklin at my local membership warehouse and I can tell you that it outperforms the PS3 (fat version) that it replaces. Some complain about the need to connect using a LAN cable, but having a wired vs. wireless connection results in faster download speeds for streaming. I'm pegging the meter now on VUDU whereas before using wireless I was just edging into their highest tier (HDX). The picture and sound quality on Blu-ray is fantastic. I'm a fairly critical videophile/audiophile and this level of quality at this price point is nothing short of amazing.

 I use all three but if I had to settle for one for general use it would be this one
TheSunpak Compact Tripod Case (14" Long x 3.25" wide)is the case needed for this tripod.

$REVIEW.: The unit performs as advertised with a multitude of customizable options for backlighting and EQ. The addition of AUX and iDevice input is nice and worked flawlessly with my brother's iPhone. My only complaint is that the included mic for phone calls sounds terrible. If it had a better directional pickup pattern and noise filtering, it would be usable.

$review_text.: I got this product for the ability to wear it without a wraparound hook; it comes with a very cheap little plastic hook, but I did not want to wear that - I would have gotten a model with a sturdier hook had I wanted that feature.The earpiece would continually rotate in my ear so that the microphone was facing down, and the rubber piece that would fit inside the ear would become so loose that it would just fall out.Eventually, after falling onto the floor, the &#34;post&#34; that holds the speaker broke.This would probably be a great product if it were able to &#34;sit&#34; in the ear and be balanced so that it doesn't rotate on its own.

$review_text.: We purchased this model LG Blue Ray because it had a good quality history and was not made in China.  As of 2012 they are now manufacturing it in China where there is no Quality Control or Inspection history on export models to the US.

$REVIEW.: I bought this unit about three months ago and, so far, I am very pleased with it. It has all the basic features you'll ever need for a mobile application. The noise limiter works very well eliminating engine noise. Just remember to run the power wires directly to the vehicle's battery and you'll have almost no interference.Overall, the unit is very well designed and built. The  channel selector knob has a very definite feel. I think that the  metal cabinet (over and under) helps reduce interference, and for me that is a big plus.I paired the radio with a K30 magnet mount antenna and got 1.2 SWR on channel  20, which is excellent!My only suggestion to Uniden would be to make the microphone cord just a foot longer! Otherwise, this is a great radio!

$REVIEW.: I was, like many, very intrigued by this thin and nicely packaged laptop and spent almost $1600 for it in April 2011

I have now had it for about 8 months and I can say it is the worst experience ever that I have had with a laptop (previously used a number of different Lenovo's, Dell's and a MacBook Pro).First,  if you plan to use this computer as your only work-related computer, forget it!

You will be sick and tired of the non-standard ports and all the adapters you have to carry along when traveling


Furthermore in order to actually access the ports you will need to lift up and slant the laptop such that you can open the access lids and plug in the adapter of your choice (that goes for the USB Ports as well).If your laptop is sitting on the table with the power adapter plug in place you will put strain on the skimpy power plug and before long you will probably have a failure with it
There is simply no way to easily open the access lids while the laptop is flat on a tabletop.All this may seem like a small problem but believe me it gets on your nerves very quickly.Now to the more serious problems


When I got the laptop it had some problems with the hinges not working as they should
This problem was taken care of by a warranty service center while traveling in Sweden
This center was actually very good and I was so impressed I went ahead and bought a Samsung Syncmaster monitor (shortly thereafter my wife sensing my excitement about Samsung service went ahead and purchased a Samsung Washer and Dryer).I never got the Syncmaster to work with the laptop


Shortly thereafter I got problems with the driver for Bluetooth
I have ignored it for a while since I do not use BT on a daily basis


When I also got other problems with the operating system we (my IT manager and me) had no other option than to use the System Recovery disk and re-install Win7


We did and proceeded to download all the drivers from Samsung(that in itself is worth talking about because it is a mess understanding which and what should be installed).After installing the drivers and my applications software I proceeded to work with the computer not initially noticing any problems


But a month ago I had similar problems as before (as well as a hardware problem - a crack appeared on the plastic bezel surrounding the keyboard

None of the hardware control functions (Fn F1 to Fn F8 worked)
The only thing that actually worked was the speaker level functions

I got a ticket number and sent it to Fort Worth, TX for warranty repair (yes that is the only place and to which Samsung has outsourced their service).After a few days I had to call to find out it was repaired
They had replaced a few things incl


the WIFI board (something that actually was working before I sent it - even if very slow)
In the "process" the repair center wiped my hard disk and reinstalled Win7
When I got the laptop back everything seemed to work fine (except the BT driver) and I was reasonably happy thinking I could install the driver for that later


My excitement did not last very long though!After installing the entire Adobe Suite I discovered that none of the Fn F11 to Fn F8 worked
I have spent numerous hours  with Samsung's chat support to no avail

I have restored the system to no avail


I finally got my case escalated to Level 2(?) and today I got to talk to a service person
After trying a few things that did not work I was told I must do a new System Install!!!! I was also told that the reason I had the problem was probably related to the fact that I had previously used the Samsung System Recovery Disk

You go figure!Samsung installed new software while it has it for repair
How can then my previous Recovery have anything to do with it? They just come up with these weird answers to get rid of you on their support line! As I have no faith that this will solve the problem I have asked for a warranty ticket again and now must send it back to Ft Worth, TX


I do this only in the anticipation that they could fix the problem so that I may someday have a secondary PC available at some point.I know now I should never have bought it

It is not a business computer, the support lacks a lot


All you get is apologies!  Don't let the sleek look, technical specifications and some of the "just got it reviews" fool you
Instead browse on Samsung 900XA03 and A03 problems and lackluster WIFI performance, etc
and you may think twice

And as far as Synmaster WIFI monitors go


Stay away from them too

I still have not got the combination to work reliably! Tomorrow I must be shopping for a new laptop.UPDATEAfter nearly one year of continuing problems Samsung finally, and after many phone calls and email interactions agrred to replace the laptop


Fine, I thought! But problem now was that Samsung did not offer this computer with Windows 7 Pro anymore (II guess they had now figured out that this mediocre laptop did not stand a chance in the business community)
After having refused to accept a Windows Home version they finally agreed to take the laptop back and refund the money I paid for it.I'm now a happy owner of a Lenovo X220 and I'm not approaching any new Samsung product purchases easily!



$SUMMARY.: Stay away from this one! It has lots of issues and poor support

$REVIEW.: This is a great buy, I bought this for my Asus Transformer (Not the Prime) which came with 16GB of on board memory, and it would have cost an extra $100 to upgrade to the 32GB version.  With this flash drive I was able to take it right out and plug it in a get 29.7GB of space, which I understand is normal.  This was well worth the $22.00 investment, for photos, apps, and videos with the fact that it came in OEM packaging but if it works I won't complain.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for cheap flash memory that works really well for tablets, phones, cameras, or any other devices that take a MicroSDHC card.

$review_text.: + PROS +It does work exactly as described.The stand is a slide locking stand that does fold up nicely inside the case.The package comes with a nice screen protector
(Although you will have to use a credit card or license as an applicator.)The snap-in internal case is incredibly exact


My iPad Air audibly clicked into the edged case with precision, but that lead to a negative remark (see below)


I removed the outer bumper from the inner support bracket and found this to be a great scratch and dent prevention method.- CONS -It's bulky and it adds more than twice the depth to the device.The biggest disappointment was in fitting the snap in the internal case

As I snapped my device into the case, the protective film was gouged out of place
Oddly enough, the precision of the case measurements don't allow for a film without some serious intervention

And since I had already spent an inordinate amount of time getting all the invisible fuzz off my screen before adding the protective film, I became frustrated
The protective film is now serving as a book cover, which incidentally, is an excellent reuse for old phone films.I'm giving this item -2 for driving me insane with irritation

+3 for exacting measurements with zero tolerance.

$review_text.: This is a great camera backpack, and for the price, can't really be beat
However, there are a couple of things that I dislike about the bag.1) The padded dividers are quite thick and take up a chunk of space within the backpack.2) The hammock system for the camera is neat but it also results in a lot of wasted space at the top of the backpack on either side of where the DSLR body sits.3) The zipper for the main flap goes down all the way to the bottom but due to the rubberized "bucket" at the bottom, has to stop above the bucket section at the base of the backpack


This is inconvenient because the lower most compartments of the backpack are hard to get at since the flap cannot be pulled apart any more


That space is pretty much dead space because anything that is stored in there will not be easily accessible unless you lay the bag completely flat and then struggle a bit with pulling your lens out of the bottom most compartment.4) The pouches/flaps in this bag are not very useful due to their lack of having any real capacity as they sit flush against the body of the backpack

This is my single biggest gripe for the bag because the other points made above are more easy to overlook


I especially find it hard to store my GND filters and polarizer along with adapter rings and cokin filter holder in the front/side pouch which is where I should be able to store them for easy access.Don't let my list of negatives fool you


It is still a great backpack

I just decided to list these points because I didn't really see them in any reviews I read when researching the backpack

If I had, I might have considered a different backpack that had more pouch space for accessories.Edit - I just wanted to clarify that while my review might perhaps sound more negative than the 4 star rating that I gave this bag, I just chose to list the few complaints I had, that I did not find in any other review at the time of purchase


There are plenty of great things about this bag, and I encourage you to read the abundant positive reviews here on Amazon to learn about them

I've owned this bag for almost a year now and I still like it

My camera has always felt safe in it
Since I don't carry more than 3 lenses at any given time, I have plenty of room in the bag for some of my other accessories.

$REVIEW.: Some mice can fit in either hand.  This one can't.  It's very comfortable if you hold the mouse in your right hand.  If you hold it in your left hand, it's shaped completely wrong.Functionally, it works well.  I'm using it with Win7 and it works exactly the way that a mouse is supposed to work...the cursor tracks, the left and right buttons work like left and right buttons should (duh!) and the wheel scrolls the screen.  All the functions are programmable, so you can modify the defaults if you want to.  The blue side button brings up the main start menu.  It's a nice feature, except I keep accidentally pressing too hard with my thumb when sliding the mouse and accidentally popping it up.  A second press and it goes away.I have a glass-top desk and it works (unlike many mice) on it...although there's some occasional skipping.  Wooden surfaces are no problem.

$REVIEW.: I am a road warrior, I've had Dells for years, most recently quad-core E6510.  I am capable of updating and upgrading my own computers.  I coveted the Macbook Air but had no interest in MacOS (or Apple pricing).  Then I noticed one of these in the hands of a very high-end professional media person - someone who cares deeply about the type of screen they use.  Did some research and here it is.  I bought the Intel i7 with 4GB RAM and 500GB slow as death 5400RPM disk drive.I bought this specific model because the RAM and the harddrive are both user upgradeable.  That is not always the case on other ultrabooks, including some Asus.  I upgraded the RAM from 4gb to 10GB, and the harddrive from physical 5400RPM to 500GB SSD.First - I gave up nearly 5lbs in laptop and gear by switching to this laptop - and lost zero performance.  Go me.The external has a brushed stainless look and is all metal.  The dimensions are almost exactly that of the MacBook Air.  The OS is of course Windows.The screen is crystal clear and very nice while in hand, and hooks up via HDMI to present dazzling visual displays on monitors.  There is an HDMI port plus mini-VGA on the side.  Yes, the LCD screen is small (It's an ultrabook, there are defined dimensions) but the clarity and crispness are so good I don't see any significant difference from my bigger 16&#34; on the Dell with lower resolution.  I spend about 10 hours a day looking at this screen and have no issues.There are three USB 3.0 ports, which is a lot for an ultrabook.  You use the USB 3.0 for network ports, wireless mouse, external drives, etc.  It has bluetooth which I use to connect to my jawbone headset.  Haven't yet found a bluetooth mouse.  The package comes with a USB 3.0 to 100MB network dongle.  I threw that away and used instead an Anker USB 3.0 to 1GB network dongle.Wireless on the unit always performs very well.The keyboard has good tactile feel, but I find sometimes I don't press enough to get a key, this is from moving from the chiclets keyboard to the spongy rubber style used by Asus.  It takes some getting used to but typing is not a problem, layout is fine.  One challenge for any ultrabook is all the extra function keys to get to normal things like Home and End.The unit advertizes upscale sound but the speakers are as expected for such a tiny laptop, quiet and small.  Using the audio jack on the side I get good sound to my headset and my speakers.  I did not buy this for sound editing, so okay for me, but be aware the sound isn't it's forte.I presumed I would hate the touch pad.  I'm a Dell pointing stick kinda guy or mouse.  And I use a wireless mouse with this Asus.  However, the touchpad is not as bad as I thought.  It has multi-finger gestures and tactile buttons.  I found it very precise.  You can turn it on or off from the keyboard, or alternatively have it automatically turn off when a mouse is detected.The unit shipped with Windoze 8.  I Hate 8.  Apparently some are shipping with Win7 but not mine.  So I wiped and reinstalled Windows 7 Ultimate.  Asus has a download website that provides all of the necessary drivers and software to run your Asus on Win 7 if you want to remove Win8.  My friends run theirs on Win8 and love it, I guess I'm just a H8er.  The wipe and install is tedious but at conclusion everything functions as expected, no loss of Asus features.I love this specific UX32VD model because I updated RAM from OEM 4GB to 10GB for $50 myself.  I used a Kingston 1600 8GB dimm and the upgrade took all of a few seconds (after minutes of tediously removing the back panel screws).  NOTE: if you do this upgrade, the memory is wrapped in an insulated cover, that is because everything is cramped in this tiny thing  and if the memory card touches anything it will short out, so you have to wrap the memory card you put in just like the one you take out.The hard drive upgrade is a bit more challenging, mainly because I used a Crucial M4, which is not 7MM so I had to remove the spacer on the hard drive (dissasemble the drive) thereby voiding the warranty.  NOTE: If you use the Crucial, this is an easy install but you MUST insulate the back cover of the drive or it will touch the chips and short out.  I used electrical tape.  No problems.  Tech savvy would be good for this install.  Google this install, there are pics and step-by-steps.One thing I noticed is that the soft metal used for the back had a bit of flex to it.  While I had the back open changing out RAM and disk, I noticed there are 5 unused screw pylons on the motherboard.  So, I cut a piece of .050&#34; plexiglass and attached to these pylons to provide more rigidity and strength to the back.  About the size of a playing card, fit perfectly on the pylons.  The cover only attaches on the edge so it fit just fine.  No more squishy back cover.One negative I see is that after removing the back cover I can see that the unit is not at all sealed.  The back just screws down but there are air/liquid gaps.  Anything that can get to the sides of the laptop will get to the motherboard, there is no protection from liquids.

$REVIEW.: I bought the first one, my kid used the GoPro everyday
 I bought a second so I can use

 I used the GoPro video with my camera for all my site walks

 The regular camera can capture a big picture but not every corners and angles


 The GoPro is a life saver when I need to see other places that my camera did not capture.GoPro provides a fisheye lense, it's a perfect condition to use GoPro for indoor where narrow workspace
 I don't have room to get away from the object to capture the picture
 In addition, with voice record, it helps to know where you are

 I recorded my customer customer's requirement


 For a better voice record, I removed the thick hard shell that enclosed the GoPro.Since I am using a video recorder for work (Not scuba diving) and I tried this GoPro to place the video at many locations

 I think the best place to place this video is on shoulder.I tried to place the GoPro at the arm wrist, the display is low and too much movement on video display.I tried to place the GoPro inside my jacket's pocket

 I almost got a perfect video capture except sometime my arms blocked the view.For my site work task the battery time is adequate for 30 minutes recording.

$SUMMARY.: So far, I bought 2 GoPro Silver videos

$REVIEW.: I love photography, and as much as I'd love to own a dSLR it's just not in my budget at the moment. This is the next best thing, in my opinion. I love the option of full manual control, and the automatic and program modes make this camera nearly foolproof. I was taking great pictures right out of the box, and they've only gotten better as I've learned more about the camera. Contrary to what other reviewers have experienced, I've enjoyed the AA batteries. It's nice to know that if I'm out on vacation and run the batteries down, I can pop into Walgreens and grab a pack for $4 rather than being without my camera until I can charge it. I immediately replaced mine with Low Self-Discharge rechargeables and find they have a remarkable lifespan. I can take probably 300 pictures or more on a charge. I've been using this camera for 6 months now, and here are some of my experiences with it:Pros:1. Zoom- Once you get used to it, the zoom is really precise. I can compose a shot in under a second without having to fiddle with it too much. At first, the variable speed zoom lever takes a little trial and error though.2. Hotshoe- To be honest here, I don't have a speedlight yet. But I am thrilled to have the option and it's next on my list to purchase.3. Layout- I find the buttons, menus and overall layout of the camera extremely intuitive and easy to use. Buttons are easily accessible and comfortable while gripping the camera. After one quick read through the manual, I could easily locate any setting I might need in the menu system.4. LCD- I am so addicted to the pivoting screen that I'm afraid I won't be able to take pictures without it when the time finally comes to upgrade from this camera. I love that I can take eye-level shots of my kids without crawling through the mud with them, lol. I can compose shots that do not include tourists' heads because I can hold the camera above the heads and still see the screen. I can take a family portrait and see that everyone is actually in the frame. Brilliant!5. Picturesa. Auto- This camera takes some of the best exposed, consistently good pictures of any point and shoot I've ever used. This holds especially true in low light.b. Manual- Mastering manual control was much simpler than I thought. Nearly all the adjustments can be made with the 4-way button. The on-screen meter runs a little underexposed for my taste, but only by about 1/4 stop. I just compensate accordingly with my settings.6. Focus checking- I frequently use the feature that shows where the camera focused after the shot. It's as easy as tapping the display button while the review image is displayed on the screen and it shows a crop at 100%, a bounding box around the focal point, the histogram and a few other details. This can be an invaluable tool when shooting because nearly all shots look sharp on the LCD of a digital camera. It's not till you download them to your computer or try to print that you'll realize if the focus was off.7. Size/weight- The camera just feels good in the hand. Enough weight and grip to balance nicely and get a stable shot. The ergonomics make it easy to hand hold, even with one hand.Cons:1. Noisy- At anything above 200 (and sometimes even lower than that), the pictures are really noisy.2. Lens cap- This might seem like a petty complaint, but really the lens cap is an important part of any camera, protecting its most delicate part. And this one is terrible. It falls off if you so much as look at the camera too hard. Forget about tossing it in a bag or purse, you'd better have a dedicated camera bag for it in case the cap pops off in transit (which it most certainly will).3. Lack of available accessories- This really limits this camera, in my opinion. The only accessories available for this model are wide angle, teleconverter and close up lenses. A greater variety of lenses and other accessories (like the underwater housing available for previous models) would have been nice.In addition to these cons, I have had 2 problems this far: the supplied USB cable died after only a few months. While I realize cables are cheap and readily available, it was a difficult problem to diagnose and caused a lot of frustration. For the price of this camera, and the fact that it comes with zero accessories, I expect the things it did include to be of a higher quality. The other problem I have is that after less than 6 months of use, the pivoting screen no longer consistently detects it's position. When I try to flip the screen outward, the camera switches the display back to the viewfinder. It works fine when I have it opened away from the camera, but as soon as it clicks in place, the display transfers. I have to turn the camera on and off several times to restore correct functionality of the screen. This is frustrating, and I've missed a shot several times because I am fighting with the camera instead of taking pictures. I plan to contact Canon customer service about this issue, but was waiting until after my recent family vacation in case the camera needs to be sent in for service. I docked the rating of the camera 1 star for the Cons and also this problem. Otherwise, I couldn't be happier with my choice of camera!

$REVIEW.: Sound perception is a subjective quality but if you like tight, solid base that is as loud as you want it without harsh, distorted bangs, etc., this is a fine choice.  If you're also a fan of the upscale Polk speakers, then you'll love this sub.  And if you get it at Amazon, you may even find it for about half of Best Buy's price.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this cable to get access to a USB port that was in back of my computer. There appears to be more than one type of USB 2.0 extension cable. One which provides power and one which additionally allows data transfer. This cable seems to just provide power and a wireless mouse dongle does not work with it. This is not a problem in my case because I do have another cable which supports the dongle. This cable will be used just for recharging a headphone amplifier.

$REVIEW.: If you don't have one of these and you occassionally find yourself looking for a place to put a flash or your camera somewhere where a light stand or tripod isn't practical, then you should try this clamp.  It has huge jaws that will clamp to the edge of a 2x4 or bigger down to bery thin material if necessary.  The v-shaped jaw also allows it to clamp effectively to almost any round pipe -- but be careful that you don't crank it down so tight that you collapse one of your light-stand shafts.Difficult to figure out (and un-documented in paper that comes wtih the clamp) is a small plastic wedge-shaped &#34;filler&#34; device that can be secured in the &#34;V&#34; of the jaw in order to make plug the V and make one side of the jaw flat.  That actually helps the devide grab more firmly to a shelf or wall of a cabinet when there's not enough room to slide the clamp all the way onto the shelf (all the way back to the hinge side of the jaw).  The wedge is stored out-of-the-way at the base of the smaller t-shaped knob.That standard stud is the key piece of the clamp and is what you'll mount any kind of ballhead or just a flash hotshoe.  The stud is also secured into it's slot on the edge of the clamp using that smaller t-shaped knob.  One end has threaded male tip that fits a hotshoe and the other end is slightly larger and fits the sometime larger opening of a ballhead mount -- like the bolt on top of your tripod.  Other Manfrotto studs will also fit the same slot where this stud mounts, but they'll need to be any of the studs that have a hexagonal base (not one of the round ones).  Therefore, if you need a female stud mounted to the clamp so that you can do something like mount this sideways to the top of a tripod & then use the jaws to grab something, that's the kind of versatility you have with this clamp.  Manfrotto's web site has several documents (catalogs & product data sheets) that show the many different ways that this clamp can be used.Once you get one, you'll realize you can probably use 2 or more in your lighting kits.

$review_text.: I bought a Panasonic TV from Best Buy  (TC L 32X ) It was almost 100 dollars more expensive than I purchased from Amazon.I'm not complaining, Best buy gave me valuable information about the ports I needed to accommodate the devices (4 in all ) and they supplied an information booth to answer any puzzling problem I may have


Enough o that.I had a problem in trying to find out how to connect my external amplifier to this TV


 I finally found out that Panasonic has only one port and it is digital and I needed Analog


This product gives the solution to that problem

I ordered it from Amazon and along with the proper cables (not supplied) and come with a package deal from Amazon solved my problem

 The output analog from this device hooked up to my amplifier is not controllable from the TV

 I can recommend this product for anyone who bought the Panasonic TV listed above

$REVIEW.: I received the product today.I am not sure if they shipped the right thing. The product says HDVR-150 on the box. No where on the box or in the manual the product mentions anything about G Sensor.I also chose the free upgradeUpgrade to FHD 1080p G sensor for HDVR-150 NO NEED TO ADD TO CART AUTO COMES W/ new order from KiWAVin the cart in order to get 1080p resolution and what I received indicates only 720p resolution instead of 1080p on the box and manual and no G-Sensor. So I don't know what they mean by free upgrade and what exactly they shipped me.I am giving only two stars for incomplete information in the packaging and misleading "free upgrade" option which I selected in the cart. If it is not what I ordered I am going to return this back.A little disappointed by the lack of complete information on the package and manual.Update on 12/07/12:The packaging was misleading. They shipped the right product and the menu options show Full HD and G Sensor options.Minor Issues: The mirror is not as bright as the original rear view mirror. The alignment after installation is at a slight angle and the holding brackets could have been longer and more secure. This is on a 2012 Prius. The left and right brackets should be designed to be closer to each other and away from the camera on the right. This way the right bracket won't have to be at the edge of the original mirror and the alignment would also be perfect.Update 01/28/2013:It was working fine for a few weeks. Now it is unreliable. It shows it is recording with a red icon. However when I put my SD card into a computer it did not have any new files recorded in the card. Sometimes it prompts to format the SD Card for no reason. The idea of the product is good. However it has these flaws:1. The rear view mirror vibrates on even modest road imperfections.2. The unit does not align perfectly straight with the stock rear view mirror.3. Recording is unreliable.4. Compression is very bad. It does not have H.264 compression so the files are really huge. 1 GB for 5 minutes for just 720p 30fps. So it records only up to 2.5 hours on 720p. Other advanced products use compression and can record up to 9 hours on full 1080p or about 13 hours on 720p 30fps.5. I am unable to use the auto dimming feature of my stock mirror.I am reducing the rating for this product to 3 stars. The seller is very supportive. Hope the next version has these flaws addressed.

$review_text.: I'm a graphic designer and photographer, and I shoot 50-200 images everyday when I am NOT traveling or shooting a job. (even more than that when I am) I began using Transcend CF cards with my Canon 40D and never had any trouble with the three 8GB cards. Stepped up to this 400x 16GB for my 50D, and now also have a 400x 32GB for use with my 7D. They seem to be as fast as my SanDisk Ducati, are premium quality and totally reliable (with a lifetime warranty) -- and typically very well priced because they don't spend money on big advertising budgets. I know I'm getting the most speed from my cameras, and -- with a good UDMA card reader (such as Lexar Pro SD/CF USB reader) -- I notice the speed difference 400x makes for big uploads. Transcend...highly recommended!

$review_text.: Based on reviews here, I purchased the Monster iSport headphones at a local big box store, mainly because I needed them immediately, and I resist purchasing from vendors who refuse to use Amazon to fulfill the order. I want to know when a product is going to be shipped and I want to use Amazon Prime. So, that's my soapbox complaint about that.As for the product, I've used it for two days, so anything I say are initial impressions. I will update this review in the future if I have new information.1. Setup is easy. Piece of cake. Simple. I had it connected to my iPhone 5 in about 10 seconds, if that.2. Controls work perfectly with iPhone 5. Anything less than that would have prompted me to return it.3. Sound is impressive, much better than any other Bluetooth based sound system that I've used. It rivals my Big Brand Name sound bar through which I play music from my iPad. However, there is a slight bias towards bass, but hardly as bad as Beats or other brands.4. The color is...well....bright. You cannot be shy about fashion with these headphones.5. Quality is outstanding. Great fit and finish, but what do you expect for this price?6. Very light, surprisingly light compared to other wired and wireless headphones.That's right out of the box. And before I say anything more, someone from Apple must have moved over to Monster to design their packaging, because it's beautiful. It's like the boxing for the iPad or iPhone.Here are some things that may or may not concern me in the future:* Comfort on the ears. This was a concern before purchasing and it is now. To stay on the head, the fit is tight, and squashes my ears. That being said, it's not painful, at least for an hour or so.* Again, there's no subtlety with these colors. People are going to notice.* The carrying bag is cheesy. I like the hard cases provided by other companies like Bose.* The cover over the micro USB port concerns me greatly. It is a small piece of rubberized plastic that you pull open with a tiny (and I mean very small) tab. It's supposed to keep the water (from sweat or rain) out of the port, but still, that cover isn't going to last 2 weeks for me. I hope it lasts forever, but I am concerned.My concerns are minor, and I need time to refute or support them. My largest concern is the USB port covering, but I haven't read about anyone damaging that, so maybe I'm overly concerned.But the sound quality, waterproofness, ruggedness, and looks (I like the bright green) make me love these headphones. They are worth the price.Two month update:* My worries about the USB cover may not be a worry anymore. The cover is stronger, and better designed than I thought at first. I don't use the little tab to pull open the cover, I just wedge my finger nails under the edge to pop it open.* Despite being drenched in sweat from my head, I have had no electronics issues with the headset. I'm not sure I'd go swimming with them (and I'm not going to test that), but they definitely put up with rain and sweat.* I've grown to love the sound. Now I'm not a big bass lover, but this headset seems to do it right, unless you love that pounding bass.* Though this has nothing to do with the quality or usefulness of the headset, it doesn't connect via bluetooth with a Playstation 4. Funny thing is that the PS4 correctly identifies the headphones, but it cannot connect. It's some proprietary Bluetooth profile on the PS4. Of course, with the PS4 you can directly connect the headphones via passive mode to the PS4 controller. This works as a great headset, if you don't want to wake up the household while you kill off aliens or whatever. However, and I might have been doing something wrong, the microphone doesn't work, so if you're doing some multi-player squad activity, it may not work. But again, I could have been doing something wrong. Digging through PS4 menus to get the right setting is not always intuitive.I've purchased dozens of headsets in my long life, and this ranks as one of the best. But at its price point, it better.

$review_text.: This bag fits your DSLR and much more and is reasonably comfortable and convenient.  Removing the camera from the bag is simple and safe with how the zipper curves at the top to try and make sure the bag doesn't open and dump everything else out.  The buckles to hold around waist and chest are useful.  The front strap-web pouch is useful for non-camera stuff like a water bottle.  For recreational use without a ton of lenses and accessories I can't imagine spending any more on another bag and noticing much of a difference.  I'm a weekend warrior so my experience may not translate to someone who needs to use it every single day.

$REVIEW.: This product I had mixed feelings on

I really liked the product for what it does
It eliminates the pesky strap that goes around your neck


The worse part about having the strap around your neck is that it felt as if you were always looking at the camera and that it was in front of you and uncomfortable all the time on the back of your neck.This strap moved it from your neck to your shoulder
It allowed me to shoot pictures through out our Disney vacation with out complaining about the strap around my neck any more

It also made having it really quite comfortable, even after walking around with it for 12 plus hours a day.The reason why I took off one star is because it said that it allowed you to move to your eye and shoot with one hand and it did, what it didn't do is that you had to lock it in the position (behind your lower back) to walk around for any length of time


This locking method prevented you from bringing it to your eye position to shoot pictures

If you left it in a semi-locked position (which it has) then walking for periods of time will cause the strap to eventually let out all the way and you have to continually retighten it.Having said that I am very glad that I purchased this strap prior to the Disney vacation

Had this been a location where long walks was not necessary like a wedding for example then I think the semi-lock position would have worked perfectly


As a side note, I did bang (get in the way of my arms) the camera occasionally but only lightly from having it on my back/side that I may not have done if I had the original stock neck strap
This was a small price to pay for me to have the camera available to me for the entire 13 days in Disney.

It has everything iPod has plus radio, recorder and an ability to be used as a USB hard drive. These features may seem useless to some but I find them to be good "extras". And it still costs less than iPod (Creative is not obsessed with spending their every dollar on advertising). I think, though not 100% sure, that iPod Video HAS TO USE iTunes. I hate when some company, however "cool" and "innovative", tries to force me to use something so that was a major factor. ZVM works with pretty much any software.

Due to some minor storms in the area where I live, the power had gone off just long enough to &#34;kill&#34; my computer.  The past two times I have been able to get it started again after some effort, but knew I needed a UPS to keep the computer on in these cases when the power went off for a few seconds.  This UPS unit has been great - has kept my computer up and running during minor surge issues.  We have not had a major storm with the power going off for a longer time, but I have confidence this unit will work right through that time and at least allow me a chance to shut down the computer correctly.  I also like the green light - it's easy to see even from a short distance.  I have not experienced any &#34;sound&#34; issues like some of the other reviewers.  My unit is quiet and efficient.

$REVIEW.: I got the leather smart cover when I bought my iPad2, but nothing for the back, since up to this point I've just laid it down face down when setting it somewhere.  So I wanted to get something finally, since I had a nice case for my first generation iPad that I've been using for a while and liked the idea of protecting the back on the new one as I did the first.I don't use an apple dock for my iPad2, so I didn't have to worry about something that would fit when docked.  I have a third party Griffin metal stand that I use for charging that just has the room in it for the plug to be manually plugged in (i.e. it's not attached to the stand) and it has plenty of room for a shell on the iPad and still allow it to fit.The pictures really don't do this justice.  It just looks and feels great.  When I was first putting it on, I was kind of wondering if it was even going to hold, since it just BARELY reaches around enough at the corners to snap into place, but it did.  And during all my normal use and holding positions, it stays just fine.  I can see if someone grips from the corner, and presses against the lip of this where it's gripping the edge of the corner, you can push it off, but when I try to do it intentionally, I have to make sure my thumb is pressing pretty much ONLY on that thin piece of plastic, with no pressure on the surface of the iPad itself, because even just a little bit of my thumb on the glass surface, and that's enough to keep me from having enough pressure on the case to snap it off.  So for me, it just can't come off without me trying from the way I hold it.As far as operation with the smart cover, flawless.  It fit just fine, and doesn't keep the cover from closing at all, or opening.  Even where the plastic covers the right edge, it's easy to get at the smart cover to lift, and if you have problems, there's the opening where the gap is for the volume and slider switch, so getting the smart cover pulled away from its magnetically closed position is very easy.  The only drawback is, as with just about every cover out there, the slight magnetism between the cover and the back of the iPad that helps keep the cover from falling away when it's "open" and behind the iPad is interfered with by the cover, since it's not close enough to the iPad now for that magnetism to work.  But for me that's not a concern simply because of how I hold it in either orientation, the cover won't fall away and dangle.Got a good grip to it without being too sticky like some of the silicone skins out there are, and not nearly as slippery as the bare metal of the back of the iPad when its naked.  Feels solid and secure in my hands.All in all an outstanding solution, and for the discounted price, a steal.Edit  16 April 2012I treat my iPads very well.  I don't even "drop" them a foot onto a couch or bed when I'm reading.  They don't get crammed into my laptop bag.  But the corners of this thing started cracking and breaking anyway within about four months.  Finally a few days ago the final straw was cracked, and it wouldn't hold on at all anymore (up to this point it had tiny bits of the top two corners left that were enough to at least hold it to the iPad).  I didn't take it off and put back on, so it wasn't stress from removing  or anything.  Just cracks that appeared after very very careful use.  Replaced it with a different type that's hopefully a little tougher than this one.

$review_text.: Very Nice sound, Bluetooth sounds great,I send the bluetooth music to my BueAnt M1 speaker or my Insignia bluetooth headphones. FM radio works well on wired headphones only because you need the wire for an antenna. Now this product would of gotten 5 starts except that it does not accept the latest playlists. It only accepts .pla playlists and they are only used on old windows players. Maybe there is a firmware upgrade, but I don not know. So since it has a Micro SD slot, I own a couple Micro SD's (they are cheap now) and I transfer my hard rock songs on one, classic guitar on another etc. And then I play the Micro SD card I want. Or you can do what the other reviewer suggests, retag your songs with MP3 tag software and this insignia will load them in a certain folder.

$review_text.: It is made out of material that appears to be cardboard (cheap).  I felt like I was going to bend it or ripe it when I put it together.  It is too small to really calibrate at distances that need to be used.  It is way too expensive, $29 to $39 more appropriate for the material it is made from. It will most likely sit in a drawer and gather dust.The only advantage of feeling like I've been taken advantage of, is to be able to hopefully warn someone who will read these reviews a little more carefully than I did.

$REVIEW.: The Sungale Cloud TV is a low budget Android HDMI port

Think along the lines of Raspberry PI, but at a higher cost
Is it a neat concept yes, will it run NetFlix well, yes

But does it mimic a cable box or compete with a full fledge tv implementation - no
The key problem between the marketing and the reality is that most of the 'internet' programs are not optimized as full screen, high quality, full length entries

If you take a look at what Plex offers on the PC, it will give you a taste..
the box tries to process news feeds of tv clips and more often than not you end up with a 30 second highlight real of the show you are trying to watch.Access to content is key to this product, unless you have another subscription (eg


Netflix) this will not be a viable end to end solution.

I'm able to get my mifi, external battery and 1tb hd on the left of the case, and all of the accompanying cables on the top of the right. I'm also able to have zippered pockets for various SD cards, usb sticks, converters etc. My only gripe about this case is the pocked on the outside. I wish they would've put a zipper on it because it feels very loose and things my fall out of the pocket easily. Aside from that this case gives me a lower profile than the timbuk2 flexito accessory bag. This meant even though it was larger it didn't puff up my backpack the way the timbuk2 one did.

$review_text.: I made a Kindle purchase less than 2 months ago and noticed immediately that I needed a light so I could read at night and not have to burn my room light while I'm reading


So, I ordered a Verso clip on light and while that certainly served my purposes I wanted a case to keep my Kindle safe from scratches as well as I wanted a light that did not require batteries and wasn't so easy to lose
During the day I would unclip the light so I can read without it but once I settled in to read at night I would spend a little time trying to find it (I lose things nowadays, baby brain I suppose)
This light is sturdy, bright and vibrant and I love that I don't have to get any more batteries

The case is thin but decent quality and the Kindle snaps in and I feel like it's very sturdy


I appreciate the light design because it doesn't add weight and I can fold the flap behind the Kindle and it's comfortable to hold and read


I would definitely recommend this case!

My hands are big and I still have to hunt and peck to type with this keyboard. You have to apply more pressure to the keys to get it to activate the character. I have mainly been using this as a carrying case. It is starting to show wear after daily use. The trim around some of the edges is starting to crack. The tab that flips over the edge of your tablet to hold it in has finally cracked from repetitive use and fell off.  If the edges get knicked from use, a sharpie marker will make it less obvious about the wear. The cure to my lack of efficiency was getting the SwiftKey 3 app which greatly improved my speed and accuracy. I wouldn't buy this again.

$REVIEW.: I must admit that when I started looking for a Bluetooth speaker system, I had a bit of a bias against Bose. Their home AV systems, in particular, always struck me as a bit overpriced (years ago, I was in the business of high end audio). But seeing a SoundLink at the Apple store, I was impressed with the size and quality. It wasn't a good place to listen, but one thing I've never faulted Bose on is their 'ear' so I knew the quality of the reproduction would be good.The good:1) Beautifully made of quality materials.2) Sound is great; very clean and detailed with nice bass balance.3) The form factor is great.4) The folding cover works very well.The bad:1) It uses the "digital watch" theory of interface design, i.e. the functions depend on pushing buttons in some order for some length of time. Want to reset the device? Hold "AUX" for 10 seconds. Want to find out how the battery is doing? Hold the power key for three seconds. (And then all you get is green, yellow, or red.) The Bluetooth indicator light itself has three modes (on, slow blink, fast blink).2) Bluetooth hasn't been quite as seamless as I'd like. Once, no kidding, it simultaneously paired with my iPhone and iPad. But the range and the quality is good.3) This may go along with "beautifully made" but it sure is heavy!The suggestion:Hey, Bose, how about making an app that shows battery power, shows what device it is paired with, and a few other things? Obviously Bluetooth is two-way, so it shouldn't be that difficult.All in all, a great product for its essential purpose.

$review_text.: I needed a lightweight case for when I'm on the go with my new Olympus EM-P2 (which is too small for most dslr camera cases) and this fits the bill perfectly.  Although it's a loose fit with just the kit lens attached the case feels secure due to the design of the sleeve and flap - and I like having the extra length at the front of the case for when I have the longer zoom lens attached.  It's also easy to slip the camera in and out because the fit is not too snug.  I can also keep an extra battery wrapped in a cleaning cloth in the front of the case.  The snaps on the flap feel secure, but as I have only been using the case for a week I can't comment on their durability.  There is a pocket on the outside of the flap and it's got ample space for extra memory cards.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a camera expert, nor do i care to be one.  I just needed a 'better than my cell camera' but not a 'high-cost professional grade camera' for certain occasions.  Something in between, and this was a very good buy to fit that need imo.  Having said that, i found it on clearance/repackaged at a certain retailer so evidently someone else didnt like it and returned it.  This model(i1237) retails around 70-80?  I bought it clr/rep for less than 60.  Again, i'm no camera-phile.  So take these impressions with a grain of salt:what i like:* 12 megapixels, 2.7" lcd screen, 3x optical/5x digital, face-tracking, anti-shake, smile detection, 28 scene modes, etc.  compare those stats to other cameras and you will see much higher prices, or similar prices for this camera, but for less megapixels.  the pics looks sharp/detailed.* takes video clips with audio* has more features/options/cutomizations than i would ever care to use or know how to operate.  there's a quick-start manual, and a cd-rom instructional.  haven't touched the cd-rom.  read the quick-start manual and got the hang of the camera well enough.* sd/sdhc compatible cards for more storage.  you will need it with the paltry 32mb of built-in storage.* fun and easy-to-use.  more complicated if you choose to use all its features, but it's good that they're there whether you use them or not.* comes with 2 aa batteries, usb cable, manual, cd-rom, wrist strap.what i don't like:* minor, but it's kinda bulky.  it's almost twice the size(width) of my friends camera with the exact same stats.  a bit heavy, but good quality build.  it's just kinda bulky.* i thought it was a unique, violet, neon-looking color at the store.  nope, its just pink.  remember, i bought a repackaged/clearance version so it was the only one at that price, so cheapskates-can't-be-choosers.  (but i must like this camera if i'm going to stick with the color)* there's a slight delay when taking a pic.  the time it takes you to say "cheeese" is the time it takes to press the button and then have it actually take the pic.  this camera isn't for people who are 'spontaneous pic takers'.  but when you're on vacation and plan on taking pics of scenery that isn't going anywhere, it's not too bad.what i haven't figured out yet:* burst mode.  amazon review says the i1237 has this burst-mode feature(take quick pics in succession).  nice feature.  can't wait to find where it is on my camera and use it.* AV outs.  as in hooking the camera up to my big screen and enjoy pics there via AV cables?  sounds great.  but i only see battery/sd card/usb cable slots.(guess i will have to look at that cd-rom software instructional for these two features)Anyway, the other review for this camera says there is a dotted line running through the screen.  Maybe we have slightly different models but mine does not have this feature.  The pics look fine in the screen and on my computer when i transferred them.  So basically, if you want a good 12 megapixel camera and see this on sale(in a color you actually want), i'd recommend it.(note: i input i1237 at amazon and it took me to the cia-1237, which looks exactly like my camera, including the bulky look and unfortunate pink color.  the amazon review also shows the i1237 number so i'm guessing my review is in the right place)[update: 8/5/'10.  after fairly extensive use on a recent vacation my impressions on this camera is even more favorable.  that burst mode i couldn't find is under 'sport mode'.  the slight delay in the pic taking is under 'auto' mode mostly(numerous other pic-taking modes have virtually no delay).  and my favorite feature is the 'pic capture option' in the video playback(switching from camera to video mode can be a hassle, so i just take short videos and play them back and when i see a good photo-op i just capture that moment as a pic).  great camera.  still wondering about the av outs, and it's still too pink and bulky.  4 1/2 stars][update: 1/9/'12.  still working, still using, still enjoying despite other options.  seriously, taking short/long videos, then previewing them on screen, and pausing it during playback and using screen-capture mode to save a pic from that video...fun and convenient.  i like this camera anyway]
$SUMMARY.: good budget camera (polaroid i1237)

Using a separate amplifier will improve it, but only marginally (that is better done with the PK1)

It is moderately durable and will last a long time with normal care
Regularly clean the jack and replace the foam pads when they wear out

These are not as bassy as most mainstream earphones but play with a wider soundstage and have better instrument separation when comparing using the same track.

$review_text.: I would pay two or three times the price I paid (about $16 when I bought it from amazon) for this unit.The sound is great


There's a full range of fm frequencies available unlike other units that have just a few pre-sets
The goose neck holds my iPod in place, but it lets me pick a place that doesn't get in the way


And the signal is strong-- I rarely have to hunt for a clear channel, even when traveling in the middle of Pittsburgh.Even the little remote control unit is handy
I made fun of it at first (who needs a remote to run something that's three feet away) but quickly realized that it lets me operate my ipod without having to take my eyes off the road
It also lets you do frequency-hunting if necessary, though for me it rarely is.I use it with an old 4th gen ipod

Once I realized how well it works, we got one for my wife's car and her ipod touch.I have not had any issues with any part of the unit coming apart, and a plastic adapter keeps it snugly in the power port in my car, so it's possible that they've worked out some of the kinks mentioned in the lower reviews here

All I know is that this is perfect-- exactly what I need for listening to the ipod in the car.

$REVIEW.: This is the best lens I own, also my favorite


It's built like a tank, has super quiet (and fast) HSM focusing, sharp as a tack, and several hundred dollars cheaper than the Canon 10-22mm.I have a Canon 30D and this lens was the best purchase I made for it

Composing shots can be tricky with such a wide field of view (you need to get really close in order to get an object in your foreground)

The 10mm has some noticeable distortion, although it's fine for landscapes -- in fact, I think the distortion makes clouds look phenomenal.I wish it were f/4 throughout the zoom range (f/2.8 would be even better)
This lens has an EF mount, so it will work on other Canon film and full-frame bodies (with some heavy vignetting).All in all, a great value


I'm very happy with my copy (pay no attention to the pixel peepers).

$REVIEW.: Nice antenna, works well now for HDTV but might be of limited use once the stations switch back to VHF in February.Update: I tried the antenna again after the TV stations have settled on their final frequencies and it's not very useful. In Phoenix statons 8, 10 and 12 have gone from UHF back to their VHF channels using new HD transmitters which makes this antenna worthless. It doesn't work as well as a simple rabbit ears so save your money and either get a better VHF/UHF combo antenna or a cheap rabbit ears at the dollar store.

$review_text.: It's tiny, but the grippy rubber means it stays put on the bottom of my 70-200mm lens collar.  In fact, this little might-might after being well tightened held my lens and camera steady even though it was slowly rotated vertically through 180 degrees.  Even the plates designed specifically for the camera didn't work that well. The D-Ring (tool-less) tightener is a great add.The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are the following two nits:1. The slot on the d-ring is too small to insert a quarter (or penny). Sometimes the extra torque you get from pocket change helps to tighten or loosen the plate.2. It's really small which makes it a bit more fidgety to get it on an arca style clamp, and it also means that you may need to mount it at right angles to what you'd normally do in order to get the most surface contact with the camera.
$review_summary.: Small and Mighty..


The grippy rubber saves the finish (and improves the grip)

$REVIEW.: I hate earbuds but I do like the convenience of not having headband style headphones and these are the kind I get most often. The sound quality is pretty decent in it's price range, although if you can stand things in your ears, you might likeSkullcandy S2TTBZ-CZ Titan Earbuds, (Chrome)better. The sound quality is much better. I just really hate having things in my ears.Mostly, I love these. The cord retracts very well and the sound quality is good enough for my uses. I would have given them 5 stars except they need replacing too often. The rubber on the ear pieces tend to start peeling up after a while which exposes the plastic under it to the sensitive skin behind your ears.I can use these comfortably with glasses, and my ears are set fairly close to my head. I've never had any problems with the cords not retracting or any other issues with them other than that rubber issue, and for the price, they are easy enough to replace.

$REVIEW.: I use this with my Canon 5D and its a great mic, it definitely improves audio quality.Are there better mics? Yes


BUT this is an amazing mic, I'm sure it's the best mic possible for the price.I prefer to use this with my Zoom H1, It makes the quality 10x better
Seriously.When I plug the mic straight into the camera, the audio is good, but you can still hear some hiss.When I plug it into my Zoom H1, It removes ALL hiss and gives me cinema-like audio quality.I recommend this mic, but I also recommend you getting the Zoom H1 or the Tascam DR-05 to go with it.Trust me it will give you the audio quality of a mic 3 or 4 times the price of this one.The Windjammer does the job nicely


It blocks wind noise perfectly.The shock absorber is great too.The overall build quality is very nice, does not feel cheap.I recommend this, but like I said, if you care about quality I would STRONGLY recommend buying a separate recorder.

$review_text.: Lots of paper in the box, none of wich is especially helpful. A few loose pieces to put together the stand, easy enough to figure out for most, but a pictural guide would be nice. (note: be sure to use the little rubber washer that you may not notice in the package so the thumbscrew will hold tight easily)The camera housing is fairly well designed, the stand is terrible though. just a simple piece of stamped metal, does have a nice finish though.  There is no place to strain relief the power cord.There is a fairly loud audible click when the camera switches to night mode, apparently switching in a IR filter. While the click can be annoying, it does seem to greatly improve the night vision compared to cameras that don't have this feature.The focal length is a little short and there is a manual focus dial on the front. Unfortunately it is very low profile so you have to kind of push on the lens end to turn it. This causes two problems, your fingers get in the way of seeing if it is in focus and when you let go the focus changes a bit so it is tricky to get it just right.The details to access the camera are conveniently located on the back of the camera so you never loose it, as well as an additional sticker you can use without staring at the back of an installed camera.  I put it on the power supply.You can access the camera through the cloud but you can also access directly on your LAN - THANK YOU! seems other cloud cameras I have used force all video through their servers to lock ou into paying for service. Since TRENDnet offers cloud free they didn't have this concern and make it easy to just pop in the IP and go directly to the camera on your own network.Maybe I missed the obvious or it is buried somewhere on the CD (no I did not read the full manual). The default user:password was nowhere to be found. Google to the rescue, it is admin:admin.Another downer was the lack of browser support. Using my up to date favorite browser I was greeted with this message:The current browser version you are using (Google Chrome 26.0.1410.65) may not be supported by the TRENDnet Cloud service. Mobile device supported by the TRENDnet CloudView mobile app, not by browser. The following MAC (except IE) and Windows browsers are supported:Firefox: up to 20.0Google Chrome: up to 25.0Safari: up to 6.0Registration is not as easy as it should be. You click registration in the camera interface and then you go to the TRENDnet website where you again have to click to register and then fill in all the camera details including model number, serial, etc. This data could easily be passed from the camera link, but if not at least give me a screen on the camera I can copy and paste from!Bottom line, there are some non technical details that are too complicated, but the technical stuff is super easy. Anyone can set this camera up, but a big font pictorial of the set up process with steps 1,2,3 would be a great addition.

$REVIEW.: I bought the 2013 Nexus 7 the weekend it came out, and needed quick protection before my vacation the next week.  This was available for quick Prime delivery, so I snapped it up.  It does the job of protecting, but I honestly don't like the case.  It's just plain clunky, and the entire time I used it, I longed for my device to be naked.  The various hooked ends that hold the device in this case are uneven, and aesthetically displeasing.  Opening the case is harder than it should be, because of the hook mechanism employed (my small children need my help to open the case).  Putting the case into stand mode is odd and slightly frustrating.  The case is thick, which adds protection, but also reduces the lightweight feel of the device, and makes this svelte device feel clunky.I used this for about a month before searching for another.  I ended up buying thePoetic Slimline Case for Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen 2013 Android Tablet Black (With Auto Wake / Sleep Function) (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic).  I love it.  It feels good in every way the i-Blason case feels clunky.  Magnetic closure alone is far superior to the hook approach.  The Poetic case goes into stand mode much easier, without partially removing your device like the i-Blason.  The Poetic case feels good in the hand, in contrast to the i-Blason's bulky, clunky feel.  With the i-Blason, I was always removing my device to go back to the superior naked feel.  With the Poetic case, my device stays in it's protective case at all times.  And frankly, the Poetic case just looks better, due to its thin and uniform design.  Not to mention, it costs a lot less.  I've also heard good things about the comparable Moko case, but I don't have personal experience.  The only good thing I would say about the i-Blason case as an advantage is the stylus loop, which the Poetic case lacks.

$REVIEW.: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX66 camera is pretty good, but in my opinion not worth the full price (currently $350 through Amazon). It excels in some areas and not so much in others. See below for my review. If you don't want to read the long version, you can skip to the short version at the end.Long VersionDesign - This camera has a very sleek design. It weighs next to nothing and is very small. And when I say small, I mean small. It is about 5.5 cm tall, 9.5 cm long, and 1.5 cm wide. The camera is so small that it does not have a tripod screw on the bottom; it has a small screw hole and they provide you with a tripod adapter that you screw into that to make it compatible. If you are a guy and/or you have big hands then this camera will not be all that fun for you. It's fairly easy to accidentally get a finger in the picture because the lens is right up at the top of the front of the camera. If you're a girl and/or you have small hands then you'll probably love this because it is just so small. Check out my uploaded picture to see. The only moving part on this camera (besides the top buttons) is the front lens cover. It slides straight down and you cannot shoot without it down. This is good because it protects your lens when you aren't using the camera, but can be a little bit of an annoyance if you happen to forget that it needs to slide down to be used. It's also easy to forget to slide it back up, which kind of defeats its purpose in protecting the lens. The camera will turn on automatically if you slide the cover down, or you can press the power button and then slide it down. It'll also turn off automatically if you slide the lens cover back up.Functionality - With the exception of the power, shutter, and zoom buttons, the camera is operated entirely through touch screen. All options are on the LCD screen. This is actually not bad, because the touch screen is very responsive (almost a little too responsive; I started recording a video before I even knew I had pressed the record button, that's how lightly you have to tap). Shutter time is quick, but write time can be fairly slow; if you're recording a video or taking photos in a mode that requires the camera to manipulate (e.g. watercolor mode), you'll need to wait a few seconds while it processes the photo.Photos - Photo quality is generally good if not amazing. It zooms in to 5x but you can then magnify that to 10x; the good thing is that at 10x as they advertise it is still pretty clear although you won't have a wealth of detail. Because of the fast shutter speed, you should be able to take photos of moving objects pretty easily. There are many different types of photos you can shoot, from regular auto mode to program mode (where you can manually manipulate ISO, etc.) to various picture effects (e.g. miniature, toy camera, partial color [one of the coolest camera effects I've ever seen; allows you to block out everything in monochrome except the color you choose to accentuate], watercolor, illustration) to different scenes (e.g. landscape, portrait, beach, gourmet [???], snow). Some of these look pretty cool, like the partial color (which can be finicky depending on the lighting, see my uploaded photos), and others are kind of throwaways. While watercolor is neat and all, I don't see that I'm going to be sending people "watercolor" photos; it seems more like a waste of what could have been a good shot (see my uploaded photo). In addition to these you can shoot in panorama, which is good in that it lets you do an automatic sweep rather than having to do the overlay with multiple photos like most cameras, AND it lets you take the panorama while sweeping either left, right, up, or down. However, the really stupid part is that it gives you an angle limit to turn the camera on, which is great if you're doing a 180 (but not a 360), but then it gives you a *time limit* or something as well. I still can't figure out what exactly is happening but it'll automatically end on its own and if you don't turn the camera all the way through its predefined limit within the countdown then it saves with a big gray space; see my uploaded photo, this is a big problem that's really annoying. There is also a background defocus that is supposed to let you shoot close-ups and blur the background, but I cannot get it to work. You can also shoot in 3D, but if you don't have a 3D television or glasses then that'll go unused. Night shots are a mixed bag; in auto mode you get a lot of "orbs," handheld mode looks good, night mode is blurry without a tripod, and high ISO mode also looks good but is a little bright (see all my uploaded photos).Videos - Video quality ranges from excellent to average depending on the type of video format you select from the Menu screen. I tried recording in both AVCHD (for HDTVs) and in regular MP4 (for computers) and the latter is just no comparison to the former. The AVCHD mode looks really fantastic but the files get saved in some weird .MPO format that my computer doesn't even recognize without using Sony's included software. You can, however, use Sony's software and there's a button right in it to convert the video to .WMV and resave, which is good. The .MP4 files can be opened in Quicktime without having to use the software or manipulate anything, but the quality is vastly degraded. They are much grainier and choppier, whereas the AVCHD videos are smooth and clear.Extras - The camera has some extra points worth mentioning. 1) This camera uses a micro SD card, so be sure you have one ready. It does not have a slot for a full-size storage card. 2) It comes with a paint pen. This is basically just a small fat stylus that you can use to select things on the camera or to draw on your photos. You can draw freestyle or the camera also has some premade frames on it that you probably won't care about unless you're a girl under 10 years old (seriously). 3) It requires the cable to charge. For some reason Sony thought it would be a good idea to not just put a slot for the battery into the charger like everybody else does, so instead you have to put the battery into the camera and then use the USB cable to connect the camera to the charger. This is not a huge deal but it just means you have to carry the cable around with you wherever you go if you think you're going to need to charge. The good news is that if you have a full USB charger in your car (like the smartphone car chargers that Verizon sells that have the regular micro USB and a second full USB) then you can charge the camera battery with it. 4) Software is included on the camera. No CDs here, folks. Instead you just plug the camera into your computer, turn it on, and after an annoyingly long Windows driver installation (for some reason it decided it wanted to install the camera as three separate drives), you can install the inventively-named PlayMemories Home software. The software is pretty basic and you have to download extra features separately. 5) Help is built into the camera. There is a button in the lower left of the screen with a question mark; just press this to go to the help screens to learn all about how to perform different functions. The camera does come with a written manual but it's fairly useless except to tell you how to charge the battery and install the software.Short VersionThis is a pretty good camera that works best if you have small hands. It sets itself apart by having all controls on the touchscreen, and thankfully has a very responsive screen. Photos are generally good quality, though some of the modes seem useless, and videos range from excellent to average depending on the video format you record in. The camera also requires a micro SD card, comes with a stylus, requires the USB cable to charge the battery, and has Sony's included software and built-in help files directly on the camera. See all my uploaded photos for examples.

$review_text.: I use this constantly on my USB wifi adapter because I wanted the maximum length of USB cable without an active repeater. I keep the adapter itself indoors then use a reverse polarity SMA extension cable to get the antenna in a good place (outside on the porch roof in a 3-inch PVC pipe sleeve made with an upside-down toilet flange as the base and a cap on the top.  It looks like if you counted down, it would blast off.)  That setup works fine and dandy, more reliable than a 32 foot USB extension with an active repeater in it which required the adapter to be outside in the PVC pipe.  When I had the adapter outside, I used various USB mini B cables that came with hard drives and cameras and they were all short and some were unreliable.  This Amazon branded cable is longer and working great.I'm still confused on max length of USB cables, but this setup works so it'll do for now.

I've restored.  Randomly after I recharge or if I leave it on and it shuts down on it's own, I have to do a soft reset (sometimes several times before even that works) to resume function.  ON the apple boards this is apparently an issue (along with other problems I've not had) since the upgrade.  I really really want to love this product, but this makes me crazy.

$REVIEW.: I received the light and it fits into my M-Edge cover perfectly, however I agree with some of the reviews that the light really does not illuminate the whole page and it doesn't stay put, due to the neck being too short and rigid


Also when you fold it down, it doesn't really lay flat, although it is no problem to close the cover

I love the M-Edge covers and own three of them, but this light needs to be improved
It will work if you don't care that you have to keep adjusting the position as you read


Hopefully they will come out with an improved version.

$review_text.: I at first didn't think I needed to spend $60 on a cover w/ a light in it.  So I bought a skin for my Kindle and a case that stored it only, spending almost just as much!  I continued to use a flash light in the car at night and a desk lamp at home.  Then my mom purchased a Kindle and this case and I was jealous!!  So I bought my own and I haven't looked back since!  It was well worth the $60.  The light that pulls out is perfect, you do not need more or less light.  The case is sturdy, easy to put the Kindle in as well as take it out.  I spent $45 on a skin for the Kindle and a case but was so in love w/ this case, I spent another $60 to have it!  You will not be sorry that you buy this!  It is amazing.  Don't do what I did and spend pointless money before hand!  Just realize this is a MUST HAVE and spend the $60 up front!!

$REVIEW.: I was skeptical of a couple of bad reviews about the sound quality because others seemed to think it was good, so I thought maybe a couple of cranks hated it irrationally


 I was wrong
 I can't believe someone would pay full price for these - I paid just over a third of that and I still feel totally ripped off


 Both the sound and the fit are bad

 Even when I hold them in place to get a good seal, the sound is weak and tinny

 Seriously, it's not any better than stock iPod earbuds and maybe even worse.

$review_text.: I ordered the rooCASE A500 folio vs OEM due to comments here @ Amazon and other sources that the OEM part didn't fit well


My rooCASE fits snug but it's still easy to remove the tablet from the case


Materials (leather, hook & loop, felt) and finish compare to good-quality day-planner covers I've had in the past
That familiar feel will surely help my transition to an electronic "day-timer" from pen & paper


This model is only the cover & landscape stand


There are no pockets or slots for anything but the tablet
The case adds significant bulk & weight to one of the heftier tablets around

The protection the case will provide and the stand are worth the extra weight for me


It would seem more secure perhaps if there were a clasp for the cover but then the smooth, clean look would be lost


We'll see how the magnetic closure holds up

All the ports & connectors that made me choose the A500 are available while the tablet is in the rooCASE except for access to the microSD slot
Not a problem for me because I don't believe I will need to remove the extra card unless it fails
The docking connector at the bottom is exposed however I don't have a dock yet so can't say if it would sit in a dock well while still in the case
Rear-facing camera & flash are fully exposed

Front camera hole is at the proper location
There is a hole in the case along the top horizontal to the right

I'm not yet sure what it is supposed to expose


I guess I'll have to read the manual! Adding another seven percent to the msrp for a cover seemed expensive but now that I have it, it will be worth it

It is much less fragile and more safely portable


At the time I pre-ordered this, the OEM part was more expensive

Now this has the higher price

Very pleased with item & overall purchase.

I was concerned that the batteries might be too snug in my Canon SX260 camera, as some had reported. They fit great, just like my Canon battery. Battery life is great so far.

$review_text.: Over the past few weeks I have been searching for a new a/v receiver to replace my Harman Kardon.  I have added a bluray player and a new plasma.  The H/K was running out of open connections.  I began with the Onkyo 606 which I got at Circuit City for $379.  It had a great power section, but ran very hot.  The biggest issue was every  time an explosion or a flash would go off on the screen, I would lose video signal to my projector.  Returned it and purchased the Yamaha 663.  Very clean and clear through my Jamo surround setup.  I won't elaborate on details because much has already been said about the quality of the Yamaha.  A week after I got the Yamaha, CC ran the Denon 988 for $650 on closeout (same as the Denon 2808).  I had high expectations since it retails for $1200.  Bottom line is it sounded about the same as the Yamaha.  I got the Yamaha for $430 at Best Buy and can't justify the extra $$ for the Denon name.  Also was not as user friendly as the Yamaha.  With my particular setup, the Yamaha gave Denon performance at a much lower price.  Hope this helps anyone decide as these 3 receivers are very close in features.

Onkyo vs

Denon

$review_text.: Needed a camera in a hurry and bought a SX150 at a mall store
 It was the only camera in their stock that uses AA batteries

Proprietary batteries are a deal breaker for me.A Targus TGC SC610 Case will hold this camera and four more AA batteries easily


Belt loop looks a little iffy, but a toy-quality carabiner as a back-up gives me peace of mind.Liked the 150 so well that I ordered the slightly less featured 130 a couple of days after buying the 150

I'd have gone with the 120, but the price on 130 was better


Any of these cameras should work well.Controls are "intuitive" if you have had a few digital cameras


Pics look great for the documentation and illustration that I do

All the features and gee-wiz may be fantastic for all I know
Do you need a self-timer that starts when you enter the picture and blink your eyes? I don't think I do, but you might.Easy access to manual control is great when images must match in exposure for after-the-fact editing
There's also a variety of white balance possibilities

No raw output tho
Turn off the image review or you spend your time waiting in between pics.Larger size,greater weight, and image stabilization make it easier to hand hold especially in lower light

And image stabilization really works well


This camera could better use strap lugs, rings, and a shoulder strap instead of a wrist strap
Ring type selector around the function set button beats hell out of a slew of tiny buttons and lots of tabbed sub menus


- A little too easy to bump things tho while intending to change one setting and accidentally changing another.Experiments moving from sensitivity of 80 or 100 have been mixed
I'm not impressed

With most digitals and oh so long ago with film I have found that higher sensitivity is a trade-off with noise.This camera uses batteries
Take a bunch of the highest capacity NiMH AA that you can get your hands on

Make sure they are in good shape and fully charged! I'm getting 100 to 150 shots out of each pair of new 2300s before getting a low battery warning
Or about two thirds the number of shots from what I got out of my previous camera
- Have to figure that features like image stabilization are not a loss-free operation.

$review_text.: I love this bag, the construction is amazing and it fits two cameras (one with out a lens the other with) as well as four lenses and everything else I could need. I love the waist strap and the extra support strap that connects to the body strap, it makes this bag very easy to carry while climbing. The padding of the bag is amazing and I love the re-sizable compartments. The water proof cover that goes over the bag works well in moderate rain, though I have never tested it with extended water exposure.My only issue with the bag and the reason I didn't give it five stars is the fact that it isn't very woman friendly. I don't think any across chest bags are made for woman, but this has to be the least worst. I am six feet tall and have a large chest, this makes the "sling" part of the bag a little more complicated. To get the bag to fit securely I have to pull the strap tight, which makes pulling it into the front of my body a little cumbersome, but not impossible. I love that I can let the bag rest in the front of my body while I change lenses or grab an extra battery. What I am sacrificing in this camera bag is their advertisement about being able to grab your camera in ten seconds. This isn't possible if you're a busty woman, but isn't a huge down side to the camera bag. It's still comfortable, still protects my camera and as a HUGE plus looks like a back-pack.I'm a photography major and wore this bag to school every day through all of my classes last semester. It has a pocket to the back of it that is meant for a laptop which I used for books. The only people who knew that I was hauling a thousand dollars worth of camera equipment were those people in my photography classes; everyone else saw it as a back-pack. For this reason alone I felt safe taking it places with me.

Great idea and has enough power to output to my Galaxy Note 3. My one tiff with it is that the power brick is larger than I expected but not an issue if you're not hauling this thing around. (Which I don't. I just keep it at my desk at home). Also want to watch your power source since this thing will not shut off when the computer does. Guess it doesn't have that sensor/switch for power saving use but that's all fine. Easy enough to unplug the thing from the unit. Otherwise great HUB!

$REVIEW.: I pulled it out of the box & plugged it into a router port and added my two printers... didn't even have to configure the one printer, easy "add device" for the other printer. Switches are tiny now and it was so easy. It's hidden and I don't plan on touching it for years. The specialty router costs $200 and a port went bad. $22 is a lot cheaper. Thank you for extending the ports.

$review_text.: I bought this headset in August 2009, and it still works great. I use it EVERY DAY!I am waiting for the price to drop a little before I buy another one. The only reason I am getting a new one is because it doesn't seem like the headset is as tight on my head anymore. But the sounds and functionality of it is still perfect. I have never had any issues that others have mentioned (the mute letting some sound through, people not being able to hear me, etc.)So I would have to say this item deserves a 5 star rating. I wouldn't be buying it again if it didn't! And I love the fact that the microphone comes down to your mouth, but it doesn't have a "spongy thing" on it. Maybe it is all in my head, but the sponge thing seems very unsanitary to me. I can clean this one with a swipe of  disinfectant cloth. Can't do that to the spongy thing!

$REVIEW.: I've spent years looking for a decent pair of affordable earbuds with: a) sound quality that's better than "good"; b) solid, durable construction; and c) good sound isolation. These are the headphones I've been looking for.First, the sound quality: warm, excellent mids, very respectable highs, and decent lows. If you're really listening for it, the bass is a little muffled, but the overall sound is so good you won't ever notice it. I can listen to songs I've heard over and over for years and hear new things now.Second, the construction: the cord is sturdy -- not indestructible, exactly, but more solid than average. The addition of a clip lets you weather the occasional snag without ripping the earbuds out of your head or yanking too hard on the cord. The plug is crooked at a 90 degree angle, which turns out to be very practical in most situations.Third, the sound isolation is quite good. The package includes several different sizes and styles of earbuds; the biggest ones are a bit of a tight fit, but they do block out an incredible amount of outside noise.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with these. I've burned through so many other pairs of headphones over the years; I'm glad I finally found a model I really like.

$REVIEW.: Last year, I purchased the Hoodman Eyecup for my Canon T3i.  I know many photographers who use Hoodman and it's a reputable name brand but it also cost $20.  I've know of cheaper versions online but when I started seeing reviews on Amazon for this GOJA version (Note This is a JJC Eyecup using TPU rubber and this version is an EC-7/18mm Eye Cup for Canon), I had to check out for myself.And I hope this review helps those who are trying to decide whether or not to go for this version or the Hoodman version.  The Hoodman version is slightly thicker (for the rubber and the connection plate) and the connecting plate has a ridge lock right underneath.  The GOJA version doesn't.  But the biggest influence for many will be the price.  GOJA is much cheaper at $7.99.  Hoodman is $20.Now here is the reason why I prefer the GOJA/JJC version.1.  PRICE2.  While the extra ridge lock on the Hoodman is nice, for anyone who owns a Canon T3i will probably want to flip the LCD viewer out, like most eyecups for the T3i, you're going to have to take off the eyecup, flip open the LCD and put it back in.  Hoodman's are great if you own a camera with a stationary LCD screen on your DSLR.  Because T3i owners who use the eyecup need to take it on and off, chances of losing it are great and thus, having to repurchase a $20 eyecup may be pricey to some.  Otherwise, if you lose a $7.99 eyecup, you won't feel as bad.3.  Comfort - The rubber is comfortable and like the Hoodman's, you can easily rotate it if you want to use your left eye or right eye.JUDGMENT CALL:The Hoodman eyecups are great (granted you may want to do your research first before buying as you may buy the wrong version as many have done) but they are much more expensive.  Eyecups tend to get lost if you tend to remove them often and for Canon T3i owners, you are going to have to remove it often if you plan to extend your LCD viewer.With that being said, for a low price alternative that fits perfectly on a Canon T3i, snug and not loose when connected, easily rotatable and comfortable on the eyes and of course...THE MUCH LOWER PRICE...the GOJA/JJC eyecup works perfectly and just as good as my Hoodman!  Oh, and you also get a free microfiber lens cleaning cloth as well!Definitely recommended for Canon T3i owners! (and other cameras listed in the product description)
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic for T3i Owners!  For those contemplating this or the Hoodman version, this is much cheaper!

$REVIEW.: Since the software for my Olympus DS-330 was never updated by the Olympus company to allow it to run on Win-7 but the quality of Olympus recorders has always been excellent, I decided to try this recorder.  At first it was a bit confusing to use because it lacked the full complement of buttons I'd gotten used to.  Then it became apparent that the multi-function buttons on this model were actually easier to use than the complement of buttons on my DS-330.The sound quality on this recorder is superb.  The ease of transfer for archiving on my laptop/external drives is pure simplicity and requires no special software - you just use Windows Explorer to copy/move/delete files as you would from any folder on any drive.  The charging is equally simple and a nice feature to avoid buying new batteries all the time.  With a 32GB micro-SD card inserted, I have 541 (yes, you read that correctly - 541) hours of record time which doesn't include the internal memory capacity. Will I ever use that much time before I transfer the data to archive?  It's unlikely unless I get abducted by space aliens, Charles Manson, or someone scary like Dr. Orly Taitz, an occurrence no one would believe without lots of proof.The only drawback to this product is that it doesn't include a case or sleeve of some type to prevent scratches or damage to the recorder when carrying it in a pocket or briefcase.  Happily, Amazon sells a sleeve protector for this recorder which I bought.I would recommend this recorder to anyone with a need for recording meetings, conversations, or just making audio notes.

$review_text.: I have owned a few Garmin products. It was a gift from my wife and she picked Garmin because she knew I liked the company. I was a happy customer, but due to purposefully confusing product descriptions on mapping and lifetime updates, I have returned this unit and the accessories.First, the unit is small and light. That good since I tend to be out doors alot hiking and kayaking. This seemed to fit the bill nicely. I did find that the GPS fix wondered by several hundred feet and while I know GPS's tend to do that, the resulting track looks like balls of fur strung between lines. None of my other Garmins showed the wandering on the track.The backlight setting isn't "sticky" between power cycles by design. This is a nit, but a pretty big one. If I set the backlite, I expect it to remain where I set it between power cycles. Yes, I know, I can hit the power button three times to recall the backlight setting once it powers up, but really, *I* have to do that? Why doesn't the machine to it? Stupid feature.Finally, the base maps suck (other GPS based maps like those on the Magellan handhelds suck as well) because they only show the largest roads between locations and you must purchase a separate map to use thing for navigation. Too bad, because I wanted a handheld GPS that I could take hiking, kayaking, or driving. I will stick with my existing GPS's since they do what I need and I purchased aTomTom XXL 550TM 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator (Lifetime Traffic & Maps Edition)for the road which comes with a basemap & lifetime updates.

They're a big step up from bargain-basement headphones.Their main drawbacks are:The bass is unnaturally strong.  This could be a plus but you may need to play with your equalizer.They can get hot and uncomfortable if worn for over an hour or so.I had to replace the cable after a few years.

$REVIEW.: Ok, overall it's a good router, looks really good, easy to set up, but I wish I would knew one fact before I bought it. Even that it says it's a dual band, you can operate only one band at a time. Wireless b/g can only be operated at 2.4Ghz, so does a/n, but at 5Ghz no b/g support, only a/n. So if you set up for Wireless N, it works great with your PC, but if you have iPhone/Touch, or PS3 using wireless internet, only have b/g support you out of luck. So in my case, if I knew this before, I would rather paid more and bought DIR-855 model. For those that don't know 2.4Ghz band is slower, and in most cases over crowded.

$REVIEW.: I read all the reviews about these disc envelops. Several people indicated they were much more cheaply made than the Columbian brand envelops I used to buy from Sam's Club. I will not dispute the envelops are much thinner than the Columbian envelops and they also appear to wrinkle depending on the room's humidity, however, they perform just as well as the thicker, much more expensive Columbian brand.First off, the wrinkling issue disappeared within 20 minutes of leaving the envelops in the room to give them a chance to reach the relative humidity of the room. I noticed the wrinkling occurred whenever I bought a new batch up from my cool 50% humid basement to my dry and warmer 35% humid office. As soon as the envelops reached room temperature (and humidity) the wrinkles vanished. While I agree the Columbians did not show any signs of being affected by relative humidity, I assume this is the result of the thinner paper. I no longer consider this an issue since I've experienced copy paper do the same when I'd bring up a new ream from the basement.Although the envelops are thinner, I don't find them any weaker to tears or rips. While handling, they do feel a bit flimsy, but if you are using them to store discs over a period of time and the discs are not going to be handled regularly (ex. they will hold archive archived or stored backup disks) then these envelops are fine. If you are going to regularly handle the discs, then either use a jewel case or a more durable media holder.A couple of positive notes about the thinner envelops:1.) They cause fewer paper jams in my inkjet printer than the Columbian brand envelops did. I suffer about a 2% failure rate when printing on these thinner envelops, vs. the 5-7% failure rate with the Columbians. This will save me around 50 envelops per 1000, a small but noteworthy savings.(I agree there are many factors that influence failure rates, but so far, in my situation, I'm jamming on around 2 envelops per 100, vs. 5-7 envelops per 100 when I use the Columbians.)2.)The envelops take up less space than the Columbians. If 250 Columbian envelops takes up 10-inches and 250 of these envelops take up 5-inches, I am getting an additional 5-inches of storage space occupying the same footprint! (5-inches is around another 60 discs I can store in the same footprint.)Another note about printing - I am experiencing no bleed-through or ink bleed with these thinner envelops. (I use the automatic/regular paper print setting on my printer.)The window on these envelops is indistinguishable from the window on the Columbians. It appears to be made of the exact same material w/ the same toughness.The flaps appear to be 1-2mm shorter than the columbians. I had to make a 1-time minor adjustment in my print project to account for the shorter flap.The little tongue or notch that the flap folds into is about 2mm longer and more pronounced than on the Columbian envelop, but this design difference has no impact on performance.The paper folds and glue points are on the outside of these envelops, vs. the inside of the Columbian envelops. I've always wondered about this being a problem over the long haul since if the glue bleeds due to dampness or wetness, the glue on the Columbian would be more likely to bleed on the disk surface since its on the inside of the envelop. I doubt this is a real concern, but I thought I would mention it since these envelops have all their glue points at least a layer of paper between the glue and the written surface of the disk. (Printing over the glue points has been no issue and no envelop has failed, to-date, due to poor gluing.Lastly, someone said the flap folds are not pronounced enough and it caused uneven creases when folding the flap over. While I agree the flap fold is less pronounced, It has not caused any problems for me, like those described by the other reviewer(s) that mentioned it.In summary, I HIGHLY recommend these envelops since they come out to be around 1.5 cents each ($15 per 1000 envelops), instead of the 10 cents per envelop cost of the Columbians ($25 per 250 envelops). Also, if I consider failure rates, the per unit cost of the Columbians experience an additional, but slight, increase, due to higher failure rate I experience when using them.I go through about 2000 envelops per year so the savings is substantial to me. Around $30/yr for these vs. $180-200/yr. for the Columbians.One final thought...I can't believe I've spent so much time writing a review for an envelop! I hope my information helps! My recommendation is to go ahead and order a box. My order was fulfilled by amazon, so if you are not happy with them, you should be able to return them with little or no hassle.  Good luck and Happy Savings!

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my mother so she can watch her shows and listen to music on her laptop.I compared it to my $300 V-Moda m-100's and to her previous headphones a pair of on ear Sony headphones which were about $35
Compared to my V-Moda's they were obviously terrible so I didn't care much for that comparison
When I compared it to the Sony's which I had used in the past and given to my mom, they were lacking a lot

Not only did the volume have to be turned on all the way to hear anything, the overall sound quality was bad

I could go into more details but this item was that bad.I thought my mother would like them anyways but even she - 56 years old - did not like them and wanted to return them and use her old Sony headphones.As for the construction....very very very cheap material that feels like it will break at any moment

The cable is also WAY too long! It is insane, these are obviously made to listen to music on an ipod etc

not for recording music or DJing so why they decided to put a 6 foot long cable on it beats me.I understand theses cost only $26 but there are much much better choices out there with better sound and build quality and at $26 you might as well add a couple more dollars and getting something better.Don't buy this and save yourself the hassle people who have given this 5 stars have either never owned better sounding headphones or are okay with paying this much for a bad product.

$review_text.: It is as advertised. The strength of the battery is great. I keep a spare and when not in use it is kept in the refrigerator at about 35 degrees with a 40% charge. That way the battery only loses about 2 percent of its life each year. Never completely discharge a lithium battery. It will destroy it. Your lap top computer already knows when to shut down.

$review_text.: I have a collection of chargers
This is the first one that I like

I like the ability to charge each battery individually


I can monitor the charging status of each battery

 When one battery is charged, I can replace that one with the next to get charged

(Usually, I just start the charge and forget it for awhile


Then replace with the next set)It defaults to a &#34;fast&#34; charge

I'd prefer it to default to a &#34;slow&#34; charge

This is a personal preference, which is easy to activate

Put in first battery and press the slow-charge button.

$review_text.: My Century Link(frakkin Qwest) DSL goes down all the time, all seven of the modems/routers they've sent me are total garbage.  This router works perfectly, no wifi constantly going down.  I don't have to re-input network information every two days.  I plugged everything in, turned the wifi off on my modem, and the medialink worked IMMEDIATELY.  I went in to change some preferences, but if you aren't tech savvy.  This is the router to get.  Follow the simple instructions, plug it in, turn it on, turn off your modem wifi if it has it (otherwise it may confuse you, and I've noticed that the Qwest router interferes with the signal).  You don't have to turn off wifi, the medialink is plug it in and forget it if that's all you need.  They have excellent tech support too, if you need it.  Forget about the more expensive brands, this has been my best experience with a router, period.  I have owned many routers, linksys, belkin, netgear, and many others.  This is by far the most painless router experience I've had so far.  Oh and by the way, my wireless download speed increased on my 40mb/s connection from less than 500k/sec (actual download speeds) up to 35mb/sec.  That is 70 times faster than what Century Link said was their best router.  Also, if you have a choice (I don't)  DO NOT GO WITH CENTURY LINK OR QWEST ON YOUR DSL SERVICE. --Xexyz(Zeke) Gadget and Science Nerd Incarnate--

$REVIEW.: After picking up an HDMI switcher for use with my DirecTv box, DVD Player and Xbox 360, I needed 3 HDMI cables

The cheapest cable I could find in any of my local retail stores was $26 for a 3ft one


I decided to look online and came across these
After seeing the low price of these cables, I decided to order a fourth cable to replace the Monster cable I was currently using (too stiff, very hard to hide in my entertainment center)
All four that I ordered (including shipping) cost me less than one, half as long, would have cost me in the store

These cables arrived sooner and are of higher quality than expected

After swapping out the Monster cable with one of these, I can tell no difference in picture quality
Don't let the low price fool you, These are great cables.

$SUMMARY.: Great Cables, Excellent price!!

Overall, the plastic construction is okay, but might not hold up to rough abuse.

They are far better than any of the other ear buds I've ever tried.  I'm very impressed with these little guys; and as someone with ridiculously sensitive skin and tender ears I'm happily surprised at how comfortable these are.  They come with several sizes of soft-squishy material so you can find the right fit for your ears.  I use them primarily for playing Skyrim and listening to Pandora, both of which require a certain sensitivity and clarity of sound to get the most out of and these ear buds deliver on all counts.

$review_text.: Five bars on my phone, no more dropped calls. That's the upshot.Installation: Mounting this on the roof is a task not to be taken lightly. I am a big DIY guy, so not an issue for me. I used PVC pipe, with L brackets, tie-wraps and copper strapping to attached the PVC to my house.  I used an iPhone app to find the nearest Verizon tower and pointed this bad boy straight at it.  It works great.  BTW, I used to have the standard ZBoost antenna up there, and it was only marginally better than none at all. This yagi works great.  The interior zBoost range is only about 15 feet, through walls, so this is really for my home office, not the whole house.Downside: my daughter says my house looks &#34;ghetto&#34; with this thing attached to the peak.  I think it makes us look like an NSA outpost.  If either of these sound like deal-breakers to you, you're probably not as desperate as I was to keep business calls from dropping.

$REVIEW.: This MP3 player is amazing.  I've been searching for a replacement for my Nano who's battery only lasts about 1 hour per charge these days.  I think this is a much superior product in many ways.First off, the Pros:1.  Battery life.  So far, I've been playing video and MP3s on one charge about 9 hours and the battery light is still 1/2 full.  The statistics claim 10 hours of video and 30+ hours of MP3 songs.  I don't know if I'll get that much, but so far I'm very happy.2.  My favorite feature of this player is that it does not rely on ID3 tags in order to catalog your music.  The majority of my MP3 collection is several years old and do not have ID3 tags embedded in the file.  My nano would not recognize these songs, but this player just plays based on files and folders.  Adding music requires no 3rd party software, just a simple drag and drop in Windows Explorer.  Couldn't be easier and I love it this way.3.  Sound quality is superb.  There is a 5 band EQ, plus "clear bass" enhancement that really brings out the lows insongs.  The EQ really lets me customize my music to my liking.  The sound quality is better than any MP3 player I've ever heard.  Sony hit a home run on this player!4.  The video feature is outstanding.  2.4" LCD screen is bright and colorful.  I didn't buy it for the video capability, but it's surely a cool bonus.5.  Navigation is a cinch.  I didn't even need to read through the instructions and I was able to navigate all the menus in a few short minutes.  The buttons on the unit are firm and responsive, and feel like they'll hold up for years.  The volume and hold buttons are on the side of the unit and are easy to access.6.  The player will bookmark your movie file for you.  So if you stop a movie and switch over to playing MP3, and then later on want to continue you movie, it will start up where you left off.  Nice feature.  And when the unit is powered off, and then powered back on, it remembers where you were in your last MP3 song (I've read that some Sony units won't do this, but this one does).Cons:1.  The file transfer speed seems pretty slow to me given it's USB 2.0.  Takes about 3 minutes to transfer a 500MB movie.  About 50 seconds to transfer a standard MP3 album.  Not a huge deal, but my Nano was much quicker.2.  When you unplug the player from the USB cable, and have hundreds of files on it like I currently have, it has to build the library, which can take up to 30 seconds, before you can access it.  Again, a minor quirk, but nothing is perfect!3.  No FM radio, no recorder.  I can live without these features, but they may be more important to other people.  If keeping these features off the unit allows for more battery space, that's fine with me!All in all, I'd highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a high quality, great sounding MP3 player that does not require special software (re: iTunes) to run.

$review_text.: This product is by far the coolest (pun intended) cooling pad for my laptop. After trying a Belkin and Targus model, both failed miserably after prolonged usage (I am an avid gamer, most times are 5-6 hour sessions when I can). This pad seemed the way to go and I was correct. Many demanding and temperature-rising games later, this unit still functions exactly as I need. The relocatable fans is, by far, the neatest thing about this pad because you can target &#34;heat spots&#34; specifically and deliver cooler air to them (Instead of a generalized wind movement from other units). Another thing worth mentioning is this cooling pad doubles as a carrying handle for your laptop if you want.PROS:Relatively inexpensive &#34;insurance&#34;Protects against overheating (Really dropped my CPU and GPU temps under stress!)Doubles as a carry handleHas relocatable fans to target the source(s) of heatVery sturdy design and qualityVariable speed fan controlFar surpasses other brands in longetivity, value, and qualityCONS:Quite largeUncomfortable to rest in your lap (I'm assuming this was designed to stay on a desk)Clips that hold fans in place can be unlatched and pushed out from topside by accidentConclusion:A superior cooling pad for your laptop at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend and buy again!

$review_text.: I purchased this unit 8 or so months ago and was not that impressed. It was rather slow and had a heck of time keeping up... The user interface was pretty good I thought. I now have the new z140 which has gotten very mixed reviews so far. I think it's great and is a major improvement and step up from the x series. I am saying this because if i could start over, I would have spent the extra $150 or $200 to get the flagstaff z model. The z140 comes standard with the traffic tuner, which is a really great feature If you live in a heavily populated area since it will inform you of all traffic jams and road construction. Always seems to be accurate to me too...it also comes standard with hd radio, which I am not at all impressed with but if it's your thing, you will now have it too. Not to mention the screen is just under a whole inch bigger! The screen flips down to eject rather then having a slot and not motorized like this model is..... Bottom line, spend a little extra now to get the model you deserve and you won't regret it!!!

$REVIEW.: This product worked just as described
Was easy to hook up, and the cost is quite reasonable

My only complaint is that you need to be careful when dealing with the wires for that connect the emitters to your components


If you snag a wire accidentally after attaching an emitter, the emitter will pull off the end of the wire rather easily, and you can't reattach

I had to order another set of emitters after doing that to one, but it was reasonably priced and the new one worked fine

Just exercise some care when hooking this unit up.

$review_text.: Purchased this little photo only printer to compensate the photo paper capability problem with new laser paper.I also purchased 108 paper and ink set. It comes with initial printing paper set, but it's only 5 pictures which obviously not enough.The setup and operation are pretty easy, just be careful don't touch the photo paper when putting in tray. The printer can operate 100% independently with or without computer, you even don't need driver on the host computer*.This printer can accept camera connection (requires picbridge support).The printout is dry and water proof, you don't have to wait because it's dry print (thermal print).*The most interesting part is bluetooth printing. You don't need to purchase the bluetooth adapter from Canon, you just need a CSR-based bluetooth adapter (most of dirt cheap version 2.0 bluetooth adapters are CSR-based), the printer supports bluetooth OBEX file transfer, after you selected the picture, you just send it to the printer and it will print.The only drawback is cost per picture, it's around 30 cents per print if you purchase 108 picture ink set.If you want a dedicated 4R picture printer, this one is a good choice.
$SUMMARY.: Requires dedicated photo paper; wireless printing adds ease.

$review_text.: This is definitely a nice machine to own especially if you are a video gamer with lots of games that may have scratches on the games to help revive it.  It is definitely good for small business like game shops also.  A couple of draw backs though.1.  To do the repair correctly, definitely recommend you to take a look on youtube for people who have used it and will teach you a better way of getting the repair done correctly instead of following the directions included.2.  If you are a business and do a lot of repairs, the solutions and pads will get quite expensive.  Have not tried any other brand of solutions or pads, but as they recommend on their instructions, of course they want you to use their stuff so they can make money off of them.If anyone has used any other solutions or accessories which costs less, I would definitely be interested in knowing if there is any real difference.  But since I don't do a lot of repairs so haven't had the need to purchase more than what was included.If you also want to save money, the sand paper they use is 3M and you could actually but it and then cut it out yourself.  That is if you don't mind taking the time to do so.Another plus for this system is that they do offer an add-on to repair Nintendo GameCube games.  I would love to try that too but haven't touched my system in a long time so maybe will try it down the line.  Again though, would love to find out anyone who has done it and find out the out come.

$review_text.: I finally broke down earlier this year and bought myself a hard-drive-based MP3 player. First, I did some looking online. Naturally, Apple's iPod tops the lists and reviews, and I considered it. In my opinion, Apple's player is overpriced for the capacity it offers, so I crossed it off the short list. I looked at reviews and forums for other players out there and eventually settled on the Creative Nomad Zen Xtra 60GB model.My choice was based on the fairly high reviews the player got, the commentary about its excellent sound quality compared to other players (including the iPod), the capacity per dollar, and the Creative Labs reputation for PC sound technology. I found the player for a relatively low price around the $260 level ($259.99 if you must know). Compare that to an iPod's capacity and price.iPod fanatics have sneered at this player elsewhere because it doesn't have a FireWire interface.  So what? USB 2.0 is plenty fast enough and not that many non-Apple machines have FireWire because it's an expensive and not-that-impressive technology.  I can download an entire album to the player in under a minute.  They've looked down on it because it can't serve as a plug-and-play storage device.  Big deal. If I wanted handy storage I'd buy a thumb drive or flash card reader.  They've derided it because it doesn't have Apple's "wheel" or software.  I can find any song I want on the Nomad as quick as any iPod user, so I don't see an advantage there.  In fact, the only advantage I see to the iPod over the Nomad is that there are lots of iPod-specific add-on products out there and few (if any) for the Nomad... not that I've had a need for many add-ons anyway.The Nomad screen is backlit and easily readable. It took some fumbling around to get used to the menu system (about 5 minutes), but now that I'm used to it I no longer have any confusion in operating it. Loading music is fairly easy and fast. Creative ships a media organizer program that allows you to drag and drop files or folders of music onto the player's icon for immediate transfer. It takes maybe a minute to transfer a typical album (~5 seconds for the average song). Transfer is done by USB 2.0.I have heard some complaints that the transfer software is buggy and unstable. I haven't seen that so far. It's worked smoothly for me in the last 6-7 months since I bought the player.The player allows you to play music by artist (i.e., all their albums), by album, by genre, etc.  You can store non-music files on the player if you want, but you will need the driver software on any machine you want to access the files from.The capacity of 60GB is amazing. So far, I've transferred all the MP3s I had on all my computers to a single 160GB hard drive on the PC. I've also transferred over a 64-CD holder full of MP3 CDs to that drive. Even doing that, I haven't hit the 60GB mark yet (though I'm in the 50s at least). I still have another binder or two full of MP3 CDs and a couple of racks full of CDs to rip, so I'm sure I'll eventually load the thing, but it's awesome to imagine that every CD and MP3 file you have can exist on this player (even the ones you don't like).Sound quality is as good as people say it is.  With the EAX effects turned on, it gets even better.  The provided headphones do a decent job, but when I paired the player with some Shure E2C headphones, I was even more impressed.If I have a complaint about the player, it's the "apparent" flimsiness (i.e., appearance only) of the selection wheel on the side of the device.  This component, compared to the metal case and very solid feel of the Nomad, feels somewhat flimsy and weak.  Then again, it's lasted 6-7 months and hasn't had a problem.  I can't say the same for my brother's RCA Lyra, which is already having problems and is only a month or two older.Unless you like paying more for the Apple iPod, or you see some iPod-only accessory that you just "have" to have, I'd suggest saving your money and picking up a Nomad Zen Xtra or Nomad Zen Touch. You'll be getting a player with at least as many bells and whistles with a lot lower price tag.

$REVIEW.: I used this for a while while using an external monitor. Rain Design makes quality products that meet the elegance and beauty of the Mac's theyre designed for. My only complaint with the M-Tower is you can not use a case on your Mac while using this stand as it simply doesnt fit. Not a huge deal, but taking the cases off MBP's isnt always the easiest thing. Ive since retired this stand and went back to the M-Stand which I still love. Fits next to my iMac perfectly.

$REVIEW.: I tried out this one (WR-111B) and another model (the WR-333) and both are good, basic emergency radios.  The only technical difference I noticed is that the 333 has room for AAA batteries as an alternate power source.  This is probably unnecessary most of the time but if you're worried about the rechargeable battery for some reason, then you can have a backup that way.  The 333 is also bigger and has a clip on the top for hanging it up whereas the 111B has a lanyard.Both feature a small solar panel on the top to help keep the battery charged (I leave it sitting on a window sill) but there's also a hand crank.  There's a flashlight (triple LED), an AM/FM radio that can also pick up emergency weather frequencies (e.g. 162.550 MHz).  If you leave it plugged in, it can be set to automatically turn on when there's a weather alert (it says you can do this without plugging it in but it drains the battery fast).It also features an ability to plug in a cell phone.  Note that the battery on these things is fairly small -- your smart phone holds more of a charge -- so it's not going to fill up your phone.  What it CAN do, though, is give your phone enough juice to run for a few minutes which might be enough to help you out in an emergency (I imagine if you were dedicated enough you could charge your phone, crank the battery back up and then charge your phone again if you wanted more juice right away).The speaker is about what you'd expect from these radios -- weak and tinny.  But there's a stereo out jack and it sounds fine through my earphones.

$REVIEW.: I bought an old house with a couple of ceiling-recessed speakers installed.  Knowing the speakers probably weren't great quality, I decided to hook them up to this amp and plug in my Audio Technica AT-LP60USB (purchased on Amazon) into the input.  Sounds great!  I have the volume about 1/3 of the way up and it's plenty loud...I tried it about 2/3 and decided I didn't want to blow the speakers.  No noticeable distortion (if so, I'm not sure if it is the amp, wiring, or speakers at fault).  No clipping at the high volume, either...which is far better than I can say for the Radio Shack amp I tried originally.  Love the fact that it also has the aux in so I can plug in a bluetooth receiver (Miccus Mini-jack RX) and play audio from my iPhone/iPad.

$REVIEW.: Great but you have to clean the cables before you can use it. The cables were brand new, still sealed in the bag from the factory but when I took them out of the bag they had a greasy residue on them. I guess the cables are put in some mold and then epoxy is poured around the metal cables to create the plastic coating and the greasy residue is a "release agent" put on the mold to allow the cables to be released from the mold.I am not sure why these brand new cables had these greasy residue on them but I can't recall any other brand new item that I had to clean before I could use it; nobody would want to put this cable in their briefcase/backpack or wherever to take with them if it was going to stain shirts, or other items in the bag.The good news is that it was not too hard to clean the cables. I just used some paper towels to initially wipe off as much as I could and then followed that up by wiping them down with a paper towel with some rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol 70%) and that removed all the residue.As for the function of the cables they work as expected. I attached the nub to the side of the computer and then attached the Kensignton lock to that. The only surprise was in the video it showed someone just snapping the lock on without using the key, for me it felt like it was taking too much pressure so I just put the key in the lock, turned it, and then was able to easily put the lock over the nub (and then turn the key the other way to lock it into place). The other nub and lock are attached to an external hard drive.The other nice thing about the lock around the nub is that it can be rotated. On my computer when the lock is laying flat (parallel to the table) the cable blocks the DVD drive, but I can just grab the lock and rotate it and then the cable is no longer blocking the DVD drive.So it does what I wanted, it serves as deterrent to unprepared and undetermined thieves. Also it looks nice and the black cable blends in well with black USB cables and the chrome lock looks fine too (better than the tip of the cable that connects to the lock that they did not chrome). If I didn't have to waste time and materials cleaning it I would probably give it 5 stars. Some people might think it being greasy should not matter but it does to me. I haven't bought anything else brand new that I had to clean before I could use it.P.S.If you are interested in products that would stop a more determined thief but are not as aesthetically pleasing (unnoticeable) as the cable, here are some links to those items.(1)Kensington K64625WW Laptop Locking Station for 13.3-Inch to 17-Inch Notebooks or Laptopshttp://www.amazon.com/Kensington-K64625WW-Locking-13-3-Inch-Notebooks/dp/B003XDUC9U/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=3JOMNXKMHUVTI&coliid;=I20T6Q9PGFGF3L(1.2)Kensington K64632WW Tether Kit for Laptop Locking Station K64625WWhttp://www.amazon.com/Kensington-K64632WW-Locking-Station-K64625WW/dp/B003XDUCA4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=3JOMNXKMHUVTI&coliid;=I2O02LQW6IO9VV(2)Spyder 10 Laptop Bracket - Locks Laptop Open or Closedhttp://www.amazon.com/Spyder-10-Laptop-Bracket-Closed/dp/B000ZYOT4O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=3JOMNXKMHUVTI&coliid;=I1DSUFT9AC022S

$REVIEW.: For the low cost of this Ball Head, it can't be beat. I bought it specifically for my Manfrotto MM294A4 monopod and I couldn't be happier. I needed a head mainly so I could do portraiture shooting on the monopod (was using a 3/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; adapter prior with no head). The ball works perfectly.A couple bonus items that I wasn't aware of when I bought this, but have since found:-The quick release lever does have a locking pin to make sure the lever doesn't come lose. Twist the pin clockwise and it's lock. Counterclockwise and the lever is free to release.-The head has a pan function. There is onl one release knob that controls both the pan function and the ball, but the pan works well. Not exactly the smoothest cation around, so not great for video, but good for still photography. Overall, I'm very happy with the head... especially for under $20.

$REVIEW.: I am a software developer. Bought this to upgrade my Sony Vaio Touchscreen Computer from Windows 7 to Windows 8.I upgraded and activated it. It ran for 2 days before Microsoft deactivated it. My Sony then rebooted and went back to Windows 7. The preparation that Sony had advised prior to the upgrade was long and tedious and losing all my work, set me back several days. Called MS they told me to download it online. After doing that I was also offered the Windows 8 Media Center for an additional $19.00. I don't know why Amazon did not know this but apparently they did not as they shipped it quickly. I am unable to return it as it is now an open software package that Amazon nor anyone else that I know of would accept as a return. It was my mistake and I don't blame Amazon. I just wanted to let anyone else that might be unaware that this is for OEM's and not for consumers.

$REVIEW.: I use my iPad as a Kindle.  This makes reading much less taxing.  I got really old about 3 years ago when I turned 40 and lost my youth-vision...or perhaps my arms shortened?  Either way, I have to blow the font up to jumbo-huge to see it.  Poor lighting, too much glare, anything almost can force me to look uncool and have to put on those old-lady readers.  This item certainly helps.  I am uncool less often anyway.  Perhaps it diminishes the sharpness, as some reviewers have said...but not so much that I can tell.  And believe me, I notice every single day that the sharpness of anything within four feet of me is diminished.I didn't have any real problem installing it.  I have done that a fair number of times with other protectors and this one seemed about the same.

My Garmin 800 is brand new, so no previous oil or residues were present. I applied the screen from the center on outwards and no bubbles or reapplication was necessary. As suggested by the intructions, I used a credit card to gently push product seal from center outward. Could not for the life of me get a perfect invisible seal on all the edges. Bottom line: Most of the screen protector covers the screen, it does essentially what it is designed for, but does not create a 100% clear seal on the edges and is just "OK".

$review_text.: Actually, this is the only digital radio I even own, and I don't think I'll need another one


 This tuner is super sweet


 However, it is a TUNER, and does not come with any internal speakers

 You will need to supply your own.It connects fast to my wireless network, and can even be plugged in via ethernet


 I had no problems connecting ever, and havent had any buffering problems, yet.You get a ton of stations along with Pandora, and Sirius XM (subscription needed)


 You can also stream music from your computer, and via USB stick

 The display is basic, and the knob acts as a controller


 You select stations and options with it, and push the knob in to enter


There is a controller included, and I suggest using that to program stuff
 If you have an iPhone, download the Grace app for free and use that to save preset stations

 It is a lot easier using the iPhone to pick your stations
 The iPhone app will shut off the tuner, but will not turn it on.I currently have this connected to a Denon Soundbar, and the sound quality is excellent


 I give this a 5 star rating, and see no fault with the design or use based on it's price and features.I highly recommend this!

$REVIEW.: For the money spent this product is OK just be aware that the plug that is inserted into the cigarette lighter (or DC power slot) does not fit real well and it takes some twisting and turning to make proper contact.  And the gooseneck isn't as flexible as it could be.  And the slot that your iPod sits in doesn't lock the device in place so you run the risk of hitting a bump in the road and having yuor Pod go flying.  Not likely but still possible.Having said this for a very reasonable price I can connect my iPod to the car radio and that's all I was looking to do.

$REVIEW.: I bought this laptop from Lenovo directly, so that is why my review isn't "Amazon Verified".I bought the Y400 which is the 14 inch model of this computer


Everything is the same.Keep reading to see what I hated about this laptop experience.The laptop build is great

Feels very nice and sturdy and it looks very very nice especially the red back lit keyboards! The top of the lid and top of the laptop when you open are made out of metal but the underside is plastic

It is a very nice sturdy plastic though so it does not matter.The only thing I do not like on this is the glossy BORDER (don't have a problem with a glossy screen as most laptops out there have glossy screens) it makes the laptop look cheaper and does not follow the same "build material" as the rest.The laptop runs very very well


All day to day things can be EASILY done and gaming is very nice on it
I used to have an Alienware gaming laptop, which used to heat up like crazy in fact it heated up so much when I was gaming once the case got a little crack in it! This laptop runs very quietly and only WARMS up when playing very very demanding games

I was very surprised I love it! Tried running Far Cry 3 on ultra settings and the frame rates where not good

So I did a custom settings which ended up working very well with high settings on all the important things (textures etc.) I am using a single video card but I might add the extra SLI ultra bay one later

With that I am more than sure it will run all games on ultra settings.Now the problem


From day one I had a problem with mine that went like this

Every time I closed the lid and the computer went into sleep or hibernate mode I had a problem
After you would "wake up" the laptop it would not connect to the internet


The only way to fix this was to restart


Which is what I had to do EVERY SINGLE TIME I CLOSED THE LID
Very annoying
Now I am pretty good with computers, tried a couple solutions, none worked
If you look online a lot of people have this problem not only with this laptop but with many different brands etc


So after giving up on fixing it on my own because I had tried EVERYTHING I knew and everything people recommended online, I called the Lenovo tech support

And holy crap does their tech support suck
After spending 45 minutes on the phone with the Tech support, in which he took over my computer (with remote control) his solution was to disable the sleep/hibernate mode when closing the lid! I was SOO pissed off

I thought the reason he was turning off sleep mode when closing the lid, was so he could pinpoint the problem
When he told me your problem is now fixed, I told him " I was very aware that I can just turn off sleep mode...but that is not a solution that is just going around the problem" He told me that is all that can be done to which I said I just want to return the laptop


I just shipped the laptop back to Lenovo today so I can get a refund

I could not believe that their solution for a problem that is obviously so wide spread (just check the web) their solutin was just to disable sleep mode! on a laptop! Why in gods green earth would anyone want/be okay with not having sleep mode on your laptop that is the whole point! you close the lid it goes to sleep and saves you battery and most importantly you can safely transport in a case! instead Lenovo's solution is to disable it...and to leave the laptop running at all times or shut it down every single time


What a joke.EDIT: I also forgot to add that the trackpad is very spotty
The mouse jumps all over the place and even after driver upgrades nothing changed


It can be very annoying but I can live with itI really really loved the laptop as it is the best one I have found on the market especially for the price, it has the capabilities and looks of a $1200+ laptop


Once I receive my refund I am ordering another one of the same model and hopefully there will be no problems with it


This is a great computer but their technical support is horrible
They did not even offer to change the wireless card or sending a technician, both things that all other companies have always done for me if I have had a problem with a computer I bought from them

Not to mention this problem started the moment I received the laptop and I called in 3 days after I received it


Very disappointed in the tech support and hopefully I'll never need to contact them again and neither will you

But if you want a GREAT laptop both in build and capability, especially in gaming get this.

$review_text.: I got this on a whim because it intrigued me. I get tired of holding my 3rd generation iPad and the idea of something I can set on my lap to hold it is pretty appealing. I've had cases that tried to do this and hated them, but then I hate cases. I didn't really expect much out of this pillow, however. I was very wrong.The PadPillow is really very simple - a flat surface, a hinge area, and a triangle that folds. The fabric is kind of a denim or burlap, but it's soft - something durable feeling, that's all I can say. The padding is plush and makes the stand very light. There's a small flap of leather on the long flat surface where the edge of the iPad digs in to keep it from slipping. It's deceptively small but it won't let the iPad slip out. I do wonder, however, if those who have this cases on their iPads might have a harder time with this little flap holding the iPad than my bare iPad.Fold up the triangular area and it attaches with two hidden round magnets on each part. Mine seems to be a bit warped and only one set of magnets actually connects, but despite that, the connection is strong enough to hold it for reading and tapping, and even some light typing. The 60 degree angle (or so - I didn't measure this) makes it easy to read and watch video. Unfold it and it's easier to type on, but I might have liked a more in-between position where I could see more of the screen. I find myself looking around my hands a lot in the "reclined" position.The only thing it's really not is portable, which is unfortunate. It could go in a suitcase for trips, but taking it out around town would be awkward, at best. The PadPillow is unwieldy in size, in spite of being light weight and really quite useful. Fitting it into most bags is going to be a hard sell for all but the largest satchels and purses.

$REVIEW.: I seriously expected this thing to live longer than three months. When it first died, I figured it just needed a new battery and was pretty impressed that one battery had gone so long. But the second battery only lasted two days. The third batter didn't even make it 24 hours. Conclusion: it's the mouse, not the battery.For the three months it functioned, it was, however great--that said, I'm not buying another logitech mouse (or anything else for that matter).
$SUMMARY.: Great while it lasted

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my son who is now 13 years old

 I own the Sony XB600


 My two daughters also own Sony XB400s
 Hence to say, we love Sony headphones in this household
 The sound is good


 Clarity is great
 Bass is deep
 Comfort is outstanding
 Not that I can compare with other brands but after reading a few reviews from audiophile comparing other expensive brands, they too prefer the Sony headphones
 Why not?  It's affordable and great sounding
 Don't believe the marketing hype for more dollars.

$review_text.: First of all, very poor experience with the seller.  Like others here I ordered and received a shipping notice.  When it hadn't arrived 2 weeks later, I emailed and they told me there was a mixup in their warehouse.  I received the unit 2 days later.  Not sure why I had to contact them first to find out what was going on.The case itself I like in a lot of ways.  I think it looks very classy, and I feel like it provides great protection for the tablet.  I like being able to take the tablet out of the folio portion and hold it without keeping the cover flap back behind it.  The back of the interior tablet case feels really nice to hold.It does quite a large amount of bulk to the unit.  It's nice that you can shed the outer layer, and it doesn't feel so bulky, but it's a number of extra layers.  I think this provides good protection and versatility, but it is bulky.  So far it hasn't bothered me too much, but we'll see as I travel with it in the coming months.I like the versatility of propping the tablet up landscape or portrait.  I don't have any problems doing either.  It is very important WHERE you place the table on the velcro height-wise, if you want it to stay propped up.  Just place it like in the photos and you'll be fine.  I have no problem whatsoever reaching the power and volume buttons.The velcro makes me nervous to some degree, don't know how long it will last.  I don't want it to fail and my tablet goes flying out of the outer folio one day when I pick it up.Overall, a mixed bag.  But I will use it for the next month or so and see how it holds up and how I like it in real life situations.

$REVIEW.: This is really a great lens.  It's sharp, renders beautifully, and has amazing hand holdability in low light situations.  You can literally take pictures at night with this lens without using a flash.  If it's bright enough to see with the human eye, odds are you can get proper exposure with this lens without a flash.So as an available light lens for capturing candid moments indiscreetly, it is absolutely unparallelled. I mention this first because one might be confused as to how to properly utilize a 24mm F1.4 lens.  It's generally too short for portraits and won't generate a ton of background blur without getting uncomfortably close to your subject.  It generally won't be as useful to nearly as many people as a good 50/1.4 or 85/1.4 (or any classic portrait lens).However, as a photojournalistic tool it is an absolute gem.  I use it for weddings and the flexibility of this lens over the 16-35/2.8 II is pretty staggering.  The 16-35/2.8 zooms, but the 24/1.4 can take in FOUR TIMES as much light.  It's really hard to understate how valuable that can be.Technically the lens is very good.  Sharpness is very good over most of the frame at large apertures.  At small apertures, it's excellent across the frame on a full frame sensor. Focusing is very picky.  The combination of wide angle with fast aperture is difficult for most 5 series or lesser camera bodies to get right.  I have to be more careful with this lens than I do my 50/1.2 or 85/1.4 - even though the latter technically have less DOF.  Build quality of this lens is superb - fitting of it's price tag.This is an expensive lens, but for what it is, this lens is the best of it's kind.

The screen is a bit hard to see but its still cool to see how many volts your phone is using to charge it comes with a cord that has interchangeable parts its very nice. The flashlight on the side is also a great addition to the battery pack. Its also nice that the screen displays the percentage that it is charged. I think this is a very good product.

$REVIEW.: Disclaimer: 1. I am a Mac user. 2. I am not tech savy.I bought this router to replace my Airport Extreme that was on its last leg.  I read the reviews and it appeared that this was a great router for Mac users at a price that was less than the Airport Extreme.  I am not a techie and I have little, if any, ability to customize settings.  So if you have a higher degree of tech skills, then my review may not apply to you.When I went to set this router up, it was evidently set in static IP mode.  When it couldn't find an internet connection, I called our service provider and they said I had to use a dynamic IP with their service.  After spending more time than I wanted trying to figure out how to get this thing to accept a dynamic IP, I thought about calling Netgear for assistance.  Come to find out that if you want support from Netgear (even if you just purchased their product), you have to pay for it, which essentially eliminates any cost advantage this product had over the Airport Extreme (and that's if you don't include the value of my time).After several attempts to get this thing to work, I gave up.  This is going back to the store tomorrow and I'm buying an Airport Extreme.  I'm sure that someone who is more adept at network set-ups and other things computer-related would have a much better experience than did I.  But if you are not proficient when it comes to setting up networks, then this router might make you very frustrated.

$REVIEW.: I have 2 room mates here so I often use the splitter to play things for one of them. Usually the other is busy talking on skype or vent or teamspeak and has no interest or it will disturb the other who is sleeping. regardless of the situation this works very well for it's intended use. The Female sides lock in your headphones very tightly. you have to apply pressure to get them in and you'll hear a click when their in. The male side fits like any other headphones. so if you drop a mp3 (psp in my case) usually the splitter will come out before my headphones which is good because it's less strain on my headphones that way.

$REVIEW.: I am so happy we went with this lens when we purchased our Canon T4i cameras! It's easy to use and has a great range. My fiance and I have very different picture-taking styles (she uses the basic zone mostly, and I stick to the creative zone) and this lens works for both of us. I love that I can get super close and take a great macro shot and then stand back and get that great wide-angle shot that I couldn't get with my previous 70-300 (effective 35mm) lens on my Olympus, which I gave to my dad when we got our new cameras. The range on this camera is what makes it so wonderful, no need to change lenses for different shots. The clarity and focus are wonderful.Also, many zoom lenses have a problem with &#34;lens creep,&#34; which is when the lens extends on its own when you hold the camera pointing down. This one has a lock to lock it in the wide angle position when you're not using it, but it also doesn't extend from where you set it when you are using it (i.e. when you are taking a shot looking straight down and you've set the zoom somewhere in the middle, it stays there without your having to control it. The lock is particularly nice, though, when you are moving around and want to stabilize the lens to ensure it is not stressed by your movements.

$review_text.: The 580EX II makes an unbelievable difference in your shots. Period.I was under the impression that natural light was the way to go with DSLR and bought lenses accordingly, f/2.8 and below. And aperture does indeed make a tremendous difference in capturing light and creating bokeh. But for freezing movement, adding fill light (even in brightly lit scenes) and creating/shaping light for dramatic effect, the 580EX II is unmatched.On-camera, the height of the 580EX physically moves it further from your lens than any other flash, lessening harsh shadows. The 360-degree swivel allows you to bounce the light off ceilings and walls for even softer diffusion, light shaping, and more natural shadowing than any built-in--or the much-cheaper, non-swivel 270EX (which in my opinion should not even be considered if you're looking to upgrade).I've taken to using this flash almost full-time, even in bright sunlight. Its ability to quickly change in intensity from full power to (if I remember correctly) 1/320th power with a twist of the dial means I can add just the right amount of light. This is where the 580EX is heads above the others. Because the 580EX has stronger full-power and quicker recycle time than other flashes in the lineup, I can light more consecutive shots, in darker settings, capture shots from further away, and use directional light in rooms with higher ceilings, than ever before. And even in natural light, I can add just enough light to keep backlit subjects from being underexposed. With a flash you can always keep your shutter speed between roughly 1/60 and 1/250, and you'll eliminate most motion-blur or camera-shake.Once you get adventurous, take this flash off-camera and you can really get creative. For line-of-sight work, the infrared transmitter will talk to higher-end Canon bodies and even other flashes as a "master." But I went the affordable route and got some dirt-cheap $20 radio transmitters that let me position the flash around corners, inside boxes, basically anywhere within 100 feet of the camera. This is where I really started seeing some cool shots happening, as shadows and light are directed independently of your camera's position.My only words of caution: This is the heaviest flash you can buy. For me the weight makes no difference even hand-holding, but you should consider your needs if you're shooting on-camera (in that case the 430EX might be better). Also, the learning curve for full comprehension of this device may take a bit of time if you really want to master the scope of features. But really, once you figure out how to dial the intensity, you've learned 70% of what you need. I would also recommend a diffuser cap for (cheaply) softening the light even more. After you've mastered the basics, a softbox will further diffuse and shape light for dramatic effect. And buy some cheap radio transmitters, they'll make all the difference.

Fortunately these screws, like almost all computer screws, are made of pot metal, and are as malleable as plastic. Only two pins to hold the Silverstone Tek device into the standard disk holder. The other two pins which should hold the Silverstone were way off. This standard bay had no difficulties providing standard mounting for the both a WD Black 2 TB, and a Toshiba 3TB, so I can only assume that it is the Silverstone that has a nonstandard fit.

The dynamic range, channel separation and presence of the music is incredible. Be sure to review the ability of the 12BL to interface with your receiver. Older Yamaha RXV units are limited in their ability to replicate the experience of the menu on the iPod but are still functional. The 12BL also allows you to maintain manual direct control over the iPod by deselecting the display feature. There is a 15 foot extension cable that will allow you to place the dock by your side in order to enhance the manual control over the device. There are complaints about price, I only paid 20.00 for mine so it pays to shop around. Even at $60.00 this device is a worthwhile investment and truly does allow the music from the iPod to be heard at CD or near CD quality. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I have purchased about six of these cameras, and have a lot of experience with them. I find the software satisfactory. It's easy enough to use, and has some nice built in features like FTP upload, motion detection and more.However, the hardware quality seems to be hit and miss. One of these cameras had a night imaging problem where the video would go completely black at night, even though the IR LEDs were on. Another camera seemed to have poor wireless signal quality and would not run on 5.0 Volts (only 5.5 volts or more). Finally, the latest problem is that the SMA antenna jack was not screwed on tightly enough, so it came loose when installing the antenna.So I think the deal with these cameras is to test them very carefully when you first get them. If you have any problems, exchange it and try again. While they are pretty nice cameras in appearance, software and apparent quality, they suffer from typical Chinese production problems. There seems to be no quality inspection on the assembly line, or consistent training of assembly workers. So figure that you may need to return 25% of these to get working cameras.UPDATE: I'm now on the 3rd camera. This is a joke. The latest problem is that the image turns completely green after a day, and requires a reboot to fix. However, it will return again after a day. The quality control problems on this camera are getting ridiculous. I may try a 4th one, since I've already done all of hard wiring and mounting work....but I don't think I can stomach a fifth camera just to get one that works.

I have multiple smart TV's and streaming services and none of them malfunction 1/10th the time this Roku device does. I contacted Roku support to get a replacement and they told me I needed replacement remote batteries, Ive done that already and yet they still say that's the only issue.....I recommend you go with Apple TV instead. This Roku is garbage.

$review_text.: Sometimes there are things you need to get, but don't expect to love.


and for me, this is one of them


I'd stubbornly insisted on carting my work and personal laptops around in a stylish tote and it might have looked good, but my shoulders hated it
The weight of the tote and the electronics, along with all the other odds and ends that girls end up carrying made the straps dig into my shoulders and I thought I would end up lopsided.So I resigned myself to the fact that I would actually need to buy a functional laptop bag


I bought the 16&#34; bag so I could fit my work laptop (Lenovo T430, 14&#34;) and/or my personal laptop (Mackbook Air 13&#34;) along with any notepads or files I might need for work/school


After the first time I ran through public transit.

I loved this bag


It's roomy enough to hold everything I need, yet lightweight

Plus the strap  is wide and comfortable enough that the weight of the electronics no longer feels like I'm carrying a 10lb of bricks
It's also slim enough that I can slip it somewhere in my cubicle or on the floor next to my chair in class and it's out of the way


The extra pocket holds the random bits of paper, pens, and bits that I end up with when I'm at work or school instead of finding its way into my purse.All-in-all, this bag is perfect! There's enough padding that I'm not so worried if I bump into something when I'm on public transit or thump something into it

It's functional and the price was great! I'd recommend it to anyone who needs to drag their laptop to and from work or school


The only thing is that if you're using it for school, you probably won't be able to fit a full sized textbook in it.

$REVIEW.: This headset delivers amazing sound quality - even better than the Creative WP 300.  I use these with my Kindle HD and they are a dream when used via the on-board Bluetooth connection.  Pairing is simple and I was ecstatic find that they can be paired with 2 devices at a time.  For me, this means that I can pair with my phone at the same time I'm paired with my Kindle.  While watching a movie I'll get a chime when I have a phone call.  One press of a button on the headphones, and I'm talking on the phone and my movie has been paused for me.  The coolest part?  When I hang up the phone my movie automatically restarts.Call quality when paired with the phone is quite good with most callers on the receiving end being completely unaware that I am speaking to them hands-free.  I can even use the voice command texting feature on my phone with no errors.  The microphone is indeed invisible - I haven't located it yet though it seems to work very effectively.  The control switches are convenient once you get accustomed to their use.  One of the nicest features of this headset is that they fold down to fit inside a travel bag, making them a great high performance option for travelling.The padded earpieces are very nice and act as an effective noise cancelling buffer.  They are a bit snug and you may find yourself removing post-style earrings as they tend to get squished into your head a bit.  If you have a larger-than-average head you may find them to be too snug.  They are adjustable so this may not prove to be a big issue.Consider me impressed.
$SUMMARY.: These will work great with your Kindle HD as well as your phone.

$REVIEW.: This was my first wireless keyboard/mouse set, and I approached with some trepidation. Would it be non-responsive, or prone to battery failure, or radio interference, or otherwise marginal? After six months of use, I'm reporting that I'm a happy camper. It's as responsive as a wired keyboard and mouse, and it's handy to be able to move it freely on my desk. I had been previously using the "natural" (split); being a touch-typist, I had found the transition from traditional to split keyboard painless, and I agree that the split typing position is more comfortable. I see that Microsoft offers another "ergonomic" keyboard with a slight roll rather than the split; this will be a matter of personal taste, but I like the full split better. I use rechargeable alkaline batteries and freshen them up every couple of months, and it all seems to work nicely. Overall, I find the keyboard comfortable to type on. My only gripe would be the F-Lock key, which by default attaches new functionality to the old F-keys. Usually I want the traditional functionality, so I've got to remember to press F-Lock (which lights an indicator on the receiver, so I know it's set). The receiver sits on my desk and plugs into a USB port; it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It has the "lock" light indicators (presumably placed here rather than on the keyboard to avoid draining the keyboard battery). I also like the continuous scroll wheel on the mouse, as opposed to the ratcheted scroll in my previous mouse. (I didn't think I was going to like this, but I quickly came to prefer it. I haven't used the "tilt" feature of the wheel.) The two extra mouse buttons are programmable, although I was slightly disappointed to find I couldn't attach one of them to alt-Tab, which I would have liked. The black/dark color keeps it from looking smudged or dirty (although maybe if it were white I'd be motivated to clean it more often). Overall, I can't think of any keyboard/mouse I'd rather be using. I'm not sure whether to give it four stars or five, because I can't say it's so sublime as to render improvement impossible, but I don't know of anything better at this time.P.S. The keyboard has fold-down legs on the back, so you can raise the back and tilt it towards you if you want. I see another reviewer has commented that he would prefer fold-down legs on the front instead, so the keyboard could be made to tilt away rather than towards the typist. Yes, my first split keyboard had those front legs, and that was the way I liked them, but now nobody offers that feature. I guess I'm not the only person to lament the change.
$SUMMARY.: Works Great!

$review_text.: Had to replace an APC and XS1500LCD (no fan) and I was reluctant to purchase this APC BR1500G after reading reviews of fan noise.  But, to power my high-end workstation, I had no other real option in the APC product line.  Unit arrived and is operating silently.  The fan does operate when AC power is removed, but who cares? That's a benefit, and it's not objectionable when the lights are out.  The fan quits within seconds when AC power is restored.Manufacture date on this unit is 5/1/2011, as indicated on the Quality Assurance Test document.  We own a half dozen APC units in the 1200 to 1500 class and all perform very well.What's more, my Dell T7500 Workstation now has an estimated run time of 34 minutes.  Nice!

$REVIEW.: I've had this watch for a few days and just completed my 4th run with it. I did notice a bit of a gps glitch on the first run I did, but this has not repeated itself to any serious degree since then. Even the first time was nothing that I'd say would seriously affect my training. Bottom line is, if you are going to be a cutting edge earlier adopter, expect that there are going to be some imperfections to iron out. If you need or expect perfection, you might want to give Garmin a chance to investigate the bug posted by the previous reviewer (assuming that he did not just have a faulty unit) and update the firmware.But I am completely satisfied with this watch and any minor errors I've seen are totally in line with what you would get from any other watch on the market. I've had a Garmin 305 for almost two years. That's generally held up as the gold standard of GPS watches. And that has given me the occasional GPS glitch that has been far worse than what I've seen so far on the 610.For a VERY full and comprehensive review on the watch, see:[...]He even comments on the previous reviewer's situation in comment 189, saying, "I agree there's an oddity (probably a little bug) there, but I disagree that it's an issue to worry about." I totally agree with this statement. There probably are some firmware issues, which I expect will get addressed, but I would not blow them out of proportion. Virtually every device, phone, computer, ebook reader, or software package ships with bugs. That's why they ship updates that fix things. Personally, I don't feel that any gps issue with this watch is in any way a show stopper.In summary, I love this watch. I would recommend it to anyone. One thing I would comment on is that I was doubtful that this watch could be worn as a regular watch, which other people have said it could be. But I have worn it full time since getting it and it looks great and is comfortable.
$SUMMARY.: Very happy with the watch.

What a mistake. I have a 1000w Rockford Fosgate amp and a 12" Alpine Type-R sub in my car, and that wiring kit limited its power.This wiring kit from Amazon cost the same, if not a few dollars less than the walmart one, and it is MUCH higher in quality. I not only hear the difference, but can feel it. These cables give some serious bang for the buck, considering similar products can cost around $100.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase. The wire was long enough and had plenty left over in my Subaru wagon.Pros:Thick wirePlenty of wireCame with more stuff than I expectedHigh quality fuse and container (the walmart one I bought had a majorly cheapo fuse)Cons:Copper is noticeably low qualityVery little / no instructionsIf you know what you are doing and want to save money with a self installation, I say buy this NOW.

I have seen quite a few cases over the years and for my personal "enthusiast" rig I have a much more expensive case but for such a significant price difference (about $100) the NZXT Gamma case offers very similar features to my "fancier" case. All of the pros I mentioned are usually seen only in higher end cases but were implemented here as a great example of how even if construction is inexpensive you can get a lot simply by having a better design. On a production level it isn't that much harder to paint the inside, drill a few more holes and use thumbscrews instead of phillips head screws but when you actually start assembly you'll notice the little things add up and you'll have a much better experience.I've I have now purchased a total of (4) NZXT Gamma cases and every single one has lived up to my expectations. One case went to the office, two were for friends' builds and one houses my dining room PC. I wish this case was still only $40 on Amazon and Newegg but apparently its popularity has driven the price up since last year. Still worth the $50 I spent on the last one.

$review_text.: While the elaborate exterior of this case certainly looks good, it's just not a good case at all. It's bulky, and the thin elastic straps over the corners of the Kindle are flimsy and horrible. I switched back to my old case almost immediately; and since Amazon and its partners are falling all over themselves to phase out Fire accessories in favor of  the new Fire HD, that case will have to do for the life of my device. That's fine; I like it. This one, however, sucks, despite appearances.

$review_text.: As with a lot of other photographers, I am a bag junkie.  This is probably my 6th or 7th bag, and I think I may finally be done!I switch out the contents of my bag depending on what I'm going to shoot.  At max load, I have been able to fit the following items into the main compartment:* D700 body with grip* D90 body with grip* 70-200 f/2.8* 24-70 f/2.8* 85 f/1.4* 11-16 f/2.8 (Tokina)* lens hoods for all but the 11-16The insert that comes with the bag is a 4-square sectional for lenses that takes up 1/3 of the center compartment.  I store both of my bodies on one side (each wrapped in a washcloth to keep it from rubbing) and the lens hoods on the other side. I'll take a picture and upload it this weekend.The side pockets are pretty roomy.  They not large enough to hold a speedlight, but they can easily hold a small collapsible white card or several card wallets, etc.The other thing I really like about this bag is the material. It's metal and canvas and I am very comfortable that it's not going to break on me. It doesn't necessarily look like a camera bag (though all the side pockets make it stand out a little bit).  From other photographers I've talked to, the bag only gets better with age as the canvas wears.The bag is pretty large - the biggest camera bag I own.  If I ever buy another bag, it would probably be a smaller Domke for when I don't need such a big bag lol.Pictures have been posted showing how everything fits in the bag. Sorry for the obnoxious red carpet :)

$review_text.: I have slowly been upgrading a box system and the last piece left was my subwoofer.  I used this to replace a 45 watt Yamaha and the difference is night and day.  My surround is in a smaller room so I thought that I didn't need to upgrade because I didn't need more bass.  However, with this I found out that it wasn't the quantity of bass it was delivering but the quality.  This thing hits lows my old sub never knew existed.I don't think it is mentioned in the description, but mine came with a quality subwoofer cable too.

$REVIEW.: Had for a few weeks now and it is perfect, protects the screen when closed, all openings are avail, except for micro sd card.  Sometimes it takes a moment of adjusting when on a surface like the bed to prop it up, but on hard surfaces, no problem.  Actually has two different places that the back can slide into to give a different angle, the one that it is designed to go into, and the little pen holder elastic also works as a brace.  Price, design, and slimness factor  all  great!

$REVIEW.: I wanted something that would allow me to use the GPS on my bike. This one is simple and cheap enough for that. The only glitch is that the mount will not hold on to the handlebar firmly - too thin. So I had to improvise a rubber ring from some other bike accessory. But after that, it worked fine keeping the GPS in place.

$review_text.: I was initially happy to get a 64GB flash drive significantly cheaper than similar products and it comes back to bite you, now I wonder if something was wrong with the product line or I got a bad batch unit.  It&#8217;s bad enough it&#8217;s a relatively slow flash drive, I could have lived with that but for it to fail with less than moderate use is just painful.  I purchased this less than a year ago and most of the time it was just in my computer bag for the occasional file transfer.  It is not anymore recognized as a flash drive on any of the computers I have used it on.  It may offer &#8220;limited lifetime warranty&#8221; unfortunately that involves returning the &#8220;damaged&#8221; drive which may work for most users, but if you had put in important documents or files which potentially can be recovered or accessed that&#8217;s not a viable option.Lesson learned, always use drive encryption in case you want to consider warranty repairs or replacement (not the perfect solution but better than not having it) and maybe consider other brands with a better product reliability.

On my computer I used a HDMI cable to connect as long as you follow the activation instructions. I am able to listen to music with ease instead of burning music on my computer to disk, and such.I also went to see my family and brought with me. I wanted to show them pictures and videos of my life and horses and this was done easily as I brought the unit with me and again hooked up to their computer with ease.

$review_text.: i bought the black tivoli portable ipod and really enjoy it.  it has a detachable speaker that can be placed about 6' away, the speaker cord is pulled in with a knob.  sound is excellent, but no heavy bass, which is stated in the manual.  radio reception is very good.  runs either by batteries or plugs in.  battery life is not long.  takes both chargable and nonchargable batteries.  plugged in, the batteries recharges, and if you have the ipod plugged in, it will charge that also.  has a nifty remote.  has various attachments for the different ipods out in the market.  overall, i'm very pleased with this unit.  couple issues, is that there is no carrying case for it, and the radio screen can be turned off when batteries in use, but only dims when plugged in and even dimmed, it's bright.  obviously, it's not cheap, but you get what you pay for.

$review_text.: Works well for display port or DVI connections but if you need to connect to a H MDI connector through an adapter particularly the Seiki 4K unit it would not work with PNY Quadro NVS 510 Graphic Card.  The software is very tricky to do a custom install as the cards not able to recognize this monitored through the adapter You got a check two boxes to try to make custom settings, but that not clear form the screen.  The Seiki documentation is terrible but the interlace mode would work but the settings could not be saved.  Various calls to customer support or worthless.  I had a very high level software engineer I could not get to work either.  Had to return but did not use Amazon because they were out of stock and not sure what I am going to face.On the other hand, the included Nvidia desktop software is really nice and I have used it for four years.  The fact that the card only takes 35 W is great.In contrast,EVGA GeForce GT 630 1GB DDR3 Dual DVI, mHDM Worked right away it was only $70.  The 2 GB model is probably better as it took for gigabytes of system memory using 4K monitor as well as to 1K MONITORS on the side.The card only draws 25 W but be sure to get the Kepler model.  The box says it only supports 2.5 K but the website is correct about 4K.

After connecting the device to a laptop I ran through the web configuration.  If you've worked with bridge devices previously the setup is pretty much the same.  The biggest problem I encountered was determining what network settings to use on my laptop...it's not the normal 192.168.0.x.  Once configured the device has worked without a hickup.  Bridge speeds are more than adequate for Netflix streaming and Pandora streaming.  I'm happy with the device and would refer it to anyone looking for a step up from the basic consumer bridge models.

$REVIEW.: There's no need to make this a lengthy review..
because this product worked smoothly

The OEM remote with my Vizio TV quit working, leaving me wanting another remote to control my TV
 I also have a Sony Blu-Ray player, with which I've always used a separate, OEM remote.I researched my options for some time, trying to find the remote control that would be most convenient


 I saw lots of options for things that were way to high in price-- $50 or more

 I considered it all, including the fancy logitech remotes or the IR transmitters that link to your Iphone.But finally, I settled on the classic Philips remote
Why? It's only eight dollars, and promised universal connectivity

It delivered on these promises

 When I received it, I took it out of the box, and had it controlling both my Vizio TV and Sony Blu-Ray player within 10 minutes
 It comes with an easy-to-use instruction booklet that tells you exactly how to do automatic setup for whatever brands of TV or DVD player you have


 If automatic set-up doesn't work, there is also manual configuration available
Automatic set up worked for me, and very quickly I had the one remote controlling both my TV and my Blu-Ray player.In summary, I would highly recommend this remote control

 I only got it because my TV remote quit working, but now that I can control both my devices with one remote, things are much simpler, and I wonder why I didn't do this sooner
 After all, this little remote was only $8!

$review_text.: I have a ton of music on my netbook, and after a near-fatal crash, I thought I had lost it all.  I had been planning on getting a terabyte drive for sometime, and this one fit all my needs.  It is so small!  It's really about the size of a deck of cards.  It came the next day (even though I only ordered 2 day shipping) and was packaged carefully in its brand new box.  The paperwork with it is kind of pointless but I didn't need it anyway.  It comes with 1 usb cable and that's it.  When I plugged it in, a tiny light on the front let me know it was working.  It was all pretty much automatic and idiot proof from there.  It took about 4 hours for the initial back-up, and I haven't plugged it back in to do the update yet, as I haven't downloaded any new music.  The software gives you a very easy window to see both your computer's hard drive and the device's so you can see everything's location at a glance.  I consider this a great bargain!  You don't need a secondary power source, which is why I opted for the portable, and it's so tiny and quiet that you will never even notice it.  Well worth the reasonable price and serves its purpose to a T.

$review_text.: Pretty easy to install. Very study. Hangs close to wall--as close as possible for my Samsung TV because of cords that need space in back, and really too close to easily manage cords once TV is hung. I cut a hole in the wall board to run cords and cable behind wall and installed a wall plate of this sort [On-Q / Legrand WP1014-WH-V1 Cable Access Strap with Wallplate, White] in space within the mount bracket .  To feed the 5 cords I had to hold the 40-inch TV off the mount. Had the TV been any bigger or heavier I could not have done it, and it was awkward and risky as I almost dropped it. Consider installation a 2-person job if TV is big or you are feeding cables.

$REVIEW.: ...and uses the same Samsung LCD panel for $100s less.  Mine worked great right out of the box and had NO dead pixels.  I use it mostly for programming and text is very sharp with both the DVI and VGA inputs.  Backlighting is very slightly shadowed near the screen perimeters but doesn't exhibit any coloration effects (Apple users have complained about "pink" panels.)Because it has a multiplicity of inputs, I can use this monitor simultaneously with my Mac and PC and DVD/cable TV signal - and still have the RGB, S-video and Analog DVI inputs left over!  The PIP feature lets me watch TV in one window and use the rest of the screen for my computer monitor great for late night channel+web surfing.My only real beef is the  stand - the base is very heavy, but because of the spring-loaded adjustable-height mechanism the panel itself still manages to move around and starts bouncing if I'm really typing hard.  86'ing the spring and using a nice simple manual lock-down screw would have solved this problem.Overall, highly recommended!

 Being the queen of teal, this was the perfect solution

 Very durable

$REVIEW.: I'm generally impressed with this little charger


 It appears to be genuine Apple merchandise, at least when purchased from AccessoryOne

 When I first plugged it in, it made a faint buzzing noise, but the sound did not impact its performance
 Since being plugged in for a while, the noise seems to have gone away


 The product does exactly what it says - acts as a USB charging block for your iPod or iPhone


 I have no real complaints, however I docked a star for a slightly loose fit in an outlet and a slight buzzing noise produced by the product.

$REVIEW.: I had this speakers since last year, and I love them however there are a few cons to it.PROS:- Amazing sound: clear highs, full mid-range and rich tight bass.- Power that rivals many home systems (200w-total)- Satellites (35w ea) - Subwoofer (130W)- Convenient headphone and auxiliary input jacks.- Convenient and separate controls for volume and bass.- Very attractive casing.- Very easy setup- THX certified (which means you will hear things you won't hear on other speakers).Cons:The DIN Plug might bring some issues for some people due to the lack of build quality.The Sub woofer will heat up overtime, and if not cooled will blow out on you.After a while I notice a little rattle noise on woofer when playing heavy bass music.

$review_text.: Was deciding between the C270 and the C310 at the time of purchase
The only difference I could find between two was the C310 had a 5MP camera
But since the video resolution is the same for both (720p) and there was about a $10 difference I went with the C270 and am very happy.The software with the camera is nice
I like the face tracking feature, and I like that it is easily disabled.

$review_text.: I have a green thumb when it comes to electronic so...I was happy to see my drive arrive.  But once I plugged it in, my PC automatically recognized it, so I thought great.  But when I tried to burn any CD or DVD it wouldn't.  So I thought maybe for some strange reason I need to install the included software.  But it kept autoruning a installer, and failed to install the software partway through.  So I simply put the CD into my PC's built-in CD drive, and immediately it installed no glitch.  Except I got a Windows warning advising the software and the turbo usb is not windows certified and installing can cause problems now or later.Well I choose yes, since I wanted the drive to work.And the Drive using the cyberlink software showed that DVD+RW at a Max burn of 4X, the box says 8X and so do the specs on Amazon.Anyhow hitting burn resulted in a failure to burn and same for formatting, be it +r or +RW dvd's or cd's.  It wont read DVD's just Cd's barely with big errors.I was wanting to give a favorable review, but one needs the product to be working to speck to do that.Maybe when I buy another and hopefully it works, I could give more then the 1 star.Problem is the motors all work, but the microprocessor on this thing is badly defective.If this drive had outright failed, that would have been much better, as one can know right away its bad and not waste time trying to run it.Time is money and waiting to get another is frustrating.

$REVIEW.: The main points about all their main features are as follows.Low Light:  Camera does a bad job of bring detail in low light photos.  Yes it brings them in well, but it desaturates those areas poorly and their is an unattractive grey tone because of it..  The camera would be better off shooting raw and having the user adjust tones in easy free programs like Picasa and iphoto.Full HD: Actually this was pretty good.  Video and images are very clear and high quality when you are shooting in good to great conditions.  Maybe a bit saturated, but I can fix that in post if it really bothers me, and it hasn't yet.GPS:  Drains the battery and camera loses all power from a full charge within 2 hours, even if you take only a few pictures and are not using the GPS logger.  When you turn off the camera and turn it back on,  it will take 2 minutes to find the GPS signal at best.  It is not worth the time and battery suck.Zoom:  Worked well and is fast, but if you want a smaller increment of zoom, you will be going in and out to get it to where you want it.Screen: Nice size and vivid.Many other features of this camera are as worthless as the GPS because they drain the battery too fast.Because we bought this as a point and shoot and spent extra to have the GPS feature,  we feel a bit like it wis not worth it.  Do not buy this camera for the GPS feature.  And even if you don't use the GPS, still get a back up battery.  Search the other reviews on this camera for the word battery and you will see what I mean.

The base appears decently built, although it was only on there for a day to try it out.  The picture looks great, and the memory stick video option works exactly as described.  You simply load any avi movie on the stick, and it automatically gives you a plug and play menu that plays the videos perfectly.  The tv is actually in a room for cardio, and it works great with exercise videos on USB.It has been a month, and it is a very good tv.

$review_text.: I don't have a technical background to give you a nerdy review.  However, I can certainly say that my daughters take turn borrowing my headphones to listen to their IPods.  When I do have a chance to use it, I lower the source volume because it can provide clear audio even at minimal levels.  High tones are super clear.  Mids are comfortable to hear.  The bass is almost too much but expect that from a good &#34;bass&#34; headset.  My older daughter wanted one for herself so she ask to buy the MDR-XB400, for the similar look, and potential sound.. more importantly, the color.  Anyway, as for this headphone, it sounds great.

$REVIEW.: The FlipBac encroaches just a little on the viewable area of the LX5's LCD, but doesn't hinder composition at all.  I'm quite delighted by the additional perspectives this little device allows --e.g., angles that would be uncomfortable or entirely infeasible without it.  I have some concern that the use of adhesive strips to attach the FlipBac seems a bit flimsy.  However, after a month of stuffing the camera as usual in a pocket of my backpack, it seems to be holding up well.Update 11/19/2013, two years after purchase:  I don't know about those who complained this gadget is cheaply made.  It's been on my LX5 for over two years now, repeatedly shoved in and pulled out of my backpack, and has never shown any sign of breaking.  I use it ALL the time -- my favorite shots are from waist level for street photography, and you can't beat this thing if you want to get a macro shot of things at ground level.One of the best photography purchases I've ever made.

$REVIEW.: Note these headphones have an open ear design(they will leak sound).These headphones arrived before their destined date.  At first I felt somewhat skeptical about them.  The wire seem low quality and the plastic cap at the top sides of the headphones come off easily.  The sound quality seem mediocre, but after about a week I start to realize how clear and crisp the sounds they reproduced were.  The isolation of the bass and treble are great, so you don't get that muddy sound you would from cheaper products.  Although the cable seems flimsy toward the top of the headphones, I've seen Mods where people replace the cable with a higher quality one.  While the ear cushions are extremely soft and comfortable, the headphones tend to squeeze onto your earlobes after long use(Simply adjusting the headband will solve this).  Overall the headphone is awesome(can be better with slight modifications).

$review_text.: I bought this radio about a month ago and I was pleasantly surprised with its performance, especially on AM band. I own a small collection of portable radios (Grundigs, Sangean, Kaitos etc) and this little radio beats most of them in terms of AM sensitivity and selectivity. Among others, I am able to pull in AM stations from Seattle, Las Vegas, LA, San Diego, and multiple  Mexican stations on a nightly basis, despite powerful local AM stations that usually mask the weaker signals.FM performance is on par with other radios, you need to use headphones acting as an antenna to pull in weaker stations.Battery life is OK, better than other digital radios, although it definitely decreases if you use FM a lot.

$REVIEW.: I'm in this love hate relationship with this motherboard


It looks awesome but getting the wrinkles out was not fun.UEFI BIOS is pretty nice, but I'd be just as at home with a regular BIOS that had mouse maneuverability


Great overclocking features but nothing that any other board manufacturer doesn't have.This board is stable but there are a few items that I have personally had trouble with:-The USB3.0 is really finicky

Sometimes USB2.0 devices work on the USB3 ports, sometimes they don't

Not different devices, we're talking the same devices

Still haven't got this one fixed after newest driver install and latest BIOS update.-Sometimes the computer "hangs" on boot when certain devices are plugged into certain USB ports


When a USB2 mouse and USB2 keyboard are plugged into certain USB2 ports, the computer just hangs and will not boot into the Operating System

After quite a few tests, I finally found out which combination these 2 devices have to be plugged into.Still, I find myself plugging in other devices into other rear USB2 ports and the problem persists - so I just don't use some of the ports


The original shipping BIOS did not fix this, nor the newest BIOS, nor the newest drivers from ASRock


One more thing..
you can tell the computer is going to hang as there will be a slight "pixel line" through the ASRock splash screen
Weird.-The board has 2 SATA6 onboard ports and states that if you use the eSATA port on the back panel, that the hard drive connected to SATA connection #5 will be disabled


With that being said, my #5 connecor doesn't pick up any drive connected to it - ever


Again, no updates, driver or BIOS, have fixed this issue.For me, these weren't crucial problems (I've seen and had worse), but figure they were worth mentioning so that you can make an informed decision
Since I have gotten other wrinkles out, this board works great
Despite the problems, which most motherboards will have, I'd still recommend this.System Specs:ASRock P67E4G3 MotherboardIntel Core i5 2500kCorsair Vengance 2x4GB

$REVIEW.: I wanted to buy a 42" flat screen for my bedroom and was deciding between this TV and the Panasonic VIERA TC-P42X3 42-Inch 720p Plasma HDTV. I don't watch that much TV in my bedroom so a 720p is just fine and I've read you can barely tell the difference between 720p and 1080p. I have also heard that plasma is the way to go over LED and LCD (best picture quality of the 3). The Panasonic model does come with an ethernet port which can take a separately purchased wireless adapter so you can get apps like Netflix, Facebook, etc. on your TV screen. However, a lot of the reviews complained about screen glare. Plus, I bought a Samsung 50" 1080P plasma for my family room in 2008 and it works beautifully. So I went with the Samsung...The TV looks great out of the box and the stand is very sturdy. The only problem with the stand is that it does not swivel from side to side so you have to pick up the tv and move the stand if you want to change the viewing angle. The plug and play setup is a breeze and you can be watching TV within 30 seconds after plugging in the power and HDMI cable. It only has 2 HDMI ports but for me that's not a problem because I have one going into my Direct TV and the other into a DVD player. I watched Band of Brothers on DVD last night and the picture quality looked great. You can notice a window or sunlight glare if it faces directly on the screen but just close the blinds if this really bothers you. If I put it up side by side with my Samsung 50" 1080p plasma I might be able to notice a slight difference but I doubt it. Overall this is a solid TV for the price and is a perfect TV for the bedroom.PS - remember to buy the cheap HDMI cables on Amazon. They work just as well as the expensive ones!

Designed to be small enough to fit on a shelf or the corner of a desk, it never the less has enough volume to clearly and completely carry music through a noisy room (say, during a party). It has the typical "modern style" look of being black with blue lighting accents, and also comes with a small remote for volume control (the volume buttons are also duplicated on the top of the device). Connection is done easily through one of three methods: traditional Bluetooth, NFC, or direct cable connection via an auxiliary port.I primarily use mine with my laptop, and have yet to have any issues. Initially connecting the device wirelessly took seconds, and it has played through hundreds of songs and videos now without a glitch. All I get is clear sound!An interesting note about the system: did you know it has ports? It has both an auxiliary-in port and a headphone port. Don't discount either of these - the "Aux-In" allows you to connect older or non-BT devices easily with a cord (like when you want to listen to your old iPod Shuffle mix); the headphone port not only allows you to connect headphones (if, say, you're in the office and want to be courteous to others), but also allows you to pass a signal through to other devices. You probably won't ever need to pass a signal through, but I have done it once.Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars. I have no complaints with this speaker system, and am very happy with it!
$SUMMARY.: Great sound, flawless performance

$REVIEW.: Very easy to use and set destinations. One of the easier interfaces I have come across. Battery life is pretty good as I get about an hour after it starts to complain about a low battery life.Only thing I would improve on is the response time as you enter destinations. This can be a minor nuisance at times.

$REVIEW.: I was fortunate enough to get an iPad Air for Christmas (thanks to my very thoughtful girlfriend)! Obviously, I immediately wanted to get a protective case for this beautiful device. My college-age daughter also received an iPad Air for the holidays and she purchased one of the blue Apple Smart Cases to go with hers. I thought $80 was ridiculous for a simple case, however, even if it was genuine leather!I saw the Logitech Folio Protective Case while browsing Amazon, and at half the cost I figured I would give it a try. I didn't really even want a leather case because I knew it would just get scuffed-up and ruined in a few months anyway. The styling of the Logitech case is definitely more my speed, with the resilient, textured surface that is reminiscent of a nylon laptop bag - smooth leather is a bit too "fancy" for my tastes.The case fits like a glove with every opening and cutout perfectly aligned for the Air. I've been using it daily for about a month now, and both the Logitech case and my iPad still look brand new. I've only dropped the iPad once, from about a foot up onto a hard, tiled floor. It landed on the corner of the hard case and dropped harmlessly to the floor - no damage whatsoever.The highly adjustable viewing angle in landscape mode is awesome, as I can get exactly the position I want instead of being stuck with only two or three preset angles as many cases like these do. The situation in portrait mode is not as functional and I usually just end up hand-holding the device when I use it this way.I love the automatic on/off functioning with the magnetic closure - very convenient. I wish the magnets were a bit stronger, however, as my Air sometimes turns on and off unintentionally when it gets jostled in my backpack - I have heard it powering up and down on its own a couple of times.The only area I have noticed the Apple Smart Case to be superior to the Logitech case, is in terms of typing. I've seen my daughter typing away on hers a number of times and it looks very stable and fairly ergonomic. My Logitech case is all but useless for typing as the device sits at a very awkward angle for this. Fortunately (or unfortunately), I can't type to save my life so this shortcoming doesn't make any difference to me personally - but I'm sure others will find this inconvenient.Overall, a very nice accessory for my new toy, that I wouldn't even consider being without! I guess I'm just kind of cheap, but even at half the cost of the comparable Apple case, I still find it a bit pricey for what it is. But for the invaluable protection it provides for a $600 device, I guess I have to consider it an investment.**** RECOMMENDED! - 4 STAR ****

$REVIEW.: I clip this to my kindle with the standard leather cover. You don't need to use the extra clip thickener if you are using the cover. Just open the jaws, slide it down over the Kindle and cover. Perfect fit, no slip, even reading in bed laying on my side. The low setting on the brightness switch is perfect for me reading in a darkened or poorly lit room. the gooseneck allows you to light from the top, or the side (my preference) at an angle that allows for no glare. Also nice to use regular batteries I keep at home instead of having to order button cells.

This cradle charger works great with the Samsung Galaxy S III phone . The cradle charger is very easy to set up and use and works well with or without a snap on protective case on your phone. Simply popping out the plastic insert on the cradle charger allows for you to charge your phone while still leaving your protective case on the phone making the easy of use a big plus.

$REVIEW.: I'm posting this review exactly 4 months to day that I bought Rocksmith 2014. I've got 32 hours invested in the game at the moment. I've always wanted to learn guitar. I bought one and tried to self teach myself about 10 years ago and that didn't work out. This game has taught me how to play the guitar. I can't just pick up the axe and play out just yet but I am learning. It's easy for me now to pick an un-played song and in the first go hit 20-25% complete. I couldn't do that at first. The guitar is starting to feel more natural in my hands and I find that I'm locating chords faster and not having to look at the strings I'm picking as much. My fingers still hurt but I still try to play just a little longer every time. Even my friends think I'm doing better and they really didn't think I'd do well with it. Having them tell me I suck on the daily is great drive to do better and play more. My biggest problem is that I get in the way of myself. I over think it. It's best to just forget that your playing guitar and stop trying so hard. Just let it flow.

$REVIEW.: I have 6 smaller USB iPhone battery extenders, and this is the only one I now use.  Some of the others do not suppy enough power for the iPhone5 (did work for older versions).  Some do not have enough capacity to charge the iPhone5 fully or more than once.  This unit is larger than many, but it Works for my iPhone(s), iPad (full and mini), and other odd devices.  In 6 months of regular usage, it still seems to work well with no obvious loss in capacity (just a feeling - no scientific measurement made).  I am not sure why one should have to turn it on to use it (other lower-powered extenders sense when power is being drawn and switch on automatically - effectively).  Maybe the problem here is that the 9V/12V option requires an inverter and hence needs a switch - with my use mostly being the USB output, the switch is one more thing to remember when plugging something in - small quibble, I admit...

$REVIEW.: So, such amazing reviews, and its sad that i am not happy with my product. When i put up the stand in one of its two possible positions.. the one ill call movie mode, it keeps rocking back and forth. It doesnt stay upright on the table top and thats not a fun experience. Also, it doesnt stay closed. So if you decide that you do not want to use the xoom for a few hours and want to close it, the flap does not have any sort of magnet to stay covered on your xoom screen, so it looks kinda shabby when its just laying there- its actually a waste of such decent leather quality. They should have put some sort of fancy elastic band that can ensure that the flap will remain shut for the duration of an idle xoom.As i mentioned earlier, leather quality is pretty nice, it fits the xoom in all the right corners. Its nice to have holes cut out for the power button, charge light, camera, etc. It's pretty light as well. Pretty standard stuff.Overall, i'm not really impressed. Its great as a case, and even in its 2nd possible position ( the typing position, i think its the very last image the seller provides) but really sucks in the movie watching position. I want a case that doubles up as an excellent stand. I already have a gel case which works as a case. I am returning it unfortunately :(

$review_text.: While everyone ran to buy an iPad, I opted to buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab (T-Mobile) and found it to be an excellent choice


 The size is great, it's not too heavy to handle and it can easily fit into your purse or pocket


 Many times, it's not convenient to tote around a laptop so having the Galaxy Tab gives me quicker access to the internet no matter where I am; it is easy to use and navigate, and the loaded apps are very accessible
 I love the personal radio app
 The music is clear and it continues to play music in your chosen genre until you stop it

 The battery life is excellent!  I'm glad to know that I don't have to tote the charger every time I leave the house
 The camera is clearer than the one on my Blackberry phone

 Another reason I bought the Galaxy Tab is because it comes with a GPS and Kindle already loaded which took the necessity of buying 3 gadgets down to 1
 It is easy to use email and the keyboard is easy to navigate with one hand

 I absolutely love the Galaxy Tablet and would recommend it highly
 It is also easier than a laptop to use when traveling..
it is not cumbersome and you don't have to look for an outlet
 Watching t.v., movies, or listening to music is SO much easier with the Tab when you're on the go.I bought a leather protective case which has a stand alone feature so you can use the Galaxy Tab and free your hands at the same time

 LOVE IT!!!  The leather cover does not make it bulky and it has appropriate holes so you're able to get to whatever you need without taking the Tablet out of the case


 I also bought protective film covers to protect the screen


 These two items are optional but I believe they are very essential if you want your Galaxy Tab to have a long life
 Protect your investment!The Samsung Galaxy Tab will not replace my laptop but it is a great addition to my electronic family.

$review_text.: I find that this case has a thin cloth interior that you can almost see through, is a horrible orange color and shows dirt and lint easily.  The structure of the case is great, the one I received has stitched corners without any glue and the black exterior is sharp looking.  The interior is an awful change from the images on Amazon and I am really disappointed.Here's a quote from the description of this product: 'The molded EVA-foam case features fitted rubber bumpers, keeping your iPad in place while you navigate its Multi-Touch display.'  I received my iPad yesterday. put it in the case, snugged the bumpers against the four corners of the iPad, picked up the case and my iPad fell out.  Fortunately it fell into my lap!I returned the case.  The best thing about this case?  It felt so good to return it!!

$review_text.: This slim drive is slimmer than I imagined! It's half the thickness of other portable drives
It's got a simple, utilitarian design that I'm not terribly fond of


I like splashes of color
Construction-wise, it feels a bit delicate
The housing is plastic and the matte black finish picks up fingerprints and smudges like there's no tomorrow

Right out of the box, my first touch left fingerprints.It comes formatted for NTFS, so if you're a Mac user, you have 3 options: 1) wipe this drive with Drive Utility and reformat for Mac, 2) install the included Paragon NTFS drivers so your Mac and write to the drive, or 3) reformat as FAT-32
Macs can already read NTFS drives but can't write to them without additional software
For users in a dual environment, this is a great idea, but you must install it on all your Macs

In a corporate environment like mine where I am locked out from installing anything, this is not an option for me

Most users can probably go with option 3

Unless you need to store individual files that are over 4GB large (like movies), this should suffice for you (music, photos, work documents, etc)


FAT-32 is mutually readable and writable by Windows computers and Macs.Speed is good.
nothing to complain about


At its fastest, I got 90 MB/s copying some movies

Drive runs very quietly and I can't tell it's even on

I find that USB 3 cables are too short however.


I have another drive from Western Digital and the cable was just as short
18" is sometimes just not long enough if you're connecting to a desktop and the ports are inconveniently placed
But the short cable is perfect for laptop users
For older systems, USB 3 falls back to USB 2 speeds.Overall, a nice slim drive


Make sure you get a carrying case for it though

I've killed half a dozen drives carelessly throwing them into my bag or pockets


Price-wise, this drive is just OK


For just a little more, you can get a Western Digital portable with double the capacity and different colors
Assembled in China, 3 year warranty.Will update review when I am able to test Paragon on my own Mac.

$review_text.: For fun, I enjoy creating high resolution 3D animations using POV-Ray rendering software.  The images take up a considerable amount of space and often require me to transport them between computers.  The Seagate Slim 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive for Mac (STCF500102) seemed like an economical way to manage these large files and back them up for later use.My computers are Microsoft Windows based.  Luckily, I was able to use Disk Management to reformat the drive.  Seconds later it appeared as a new device and I was ready to copy files.Performance Results:To help you measure the true performance of this Seagate portable USB drive, a batch of 133 files with a total size 700Mb were copied and written to various computers.Sony Vaio Y Series laptop with SSD hard drive:Write data to Seagate Slim over USB 2.0: 33 seconds.Read data from Seagate Slim to SSD hard drive over USB 2.0: 22 secondsSony Vaio Intel i5 laptop with hybrid hard drive:Write data to Seagate Slim over USB 3.0: 11 seconds.Read data from Seagate Slim to hybrid hard drive over USB 2.0: 9 secondsThe USB 3.0 interface of the Seagate Slip moved 700Mb of files in 9 seconds.  You should consider getting a USB 3.0 port in your computer to take advantage of these speeds.  Several of my laptops and desktop computers now have a USB 3.0 interface and I really do not know how I lived without this time saving feature.In conclusion, this is a reliable way to move large files between computers at blazing fast speeds.  The small size and lightweight features of this portable USB 3.0 hard drive will give you the simplicity you need to focus on the task at hand.  The drive also gets my highest recommendation for use storing files in a safety deposit box or fireproof safe for long term storage of your valuable digital photos and videos.

It's wonderful to have, it has good sound. you're not able to decrease the volume on the speaker, you'll have to do that on your i pad or ipod or what ever you using it on. I think its a bit pricey. Its worth about 7 or 8 bucks. I gave it a 4 star because it doesn't have a vol control on it and because of the price

$review_text.: I received this TV new, but as a replacement from my extended warranty company.  I had a 52" Samsung LCD that was too expensive to fix.While the picture quality is as-good-as, I had to supplement the TV with a soundbar/subwoofer HT-CT150 combo to achieve sufficient sound quality and volume.Only 2x10W speakers is a joke for a LCD TV where there is plenty of space for big speakers and amplifier components.  I can understand how slim LED TV's having underpowered audio due to size limitations.  I guess LCD's are a dying breed and they give them the same lame audio drivers until they completely go away.== Pros ==55" Screen.Great picture quality.Handsome appearance.Bravia works good with other Sony components.Wide mode enables viewing 4:3 input signals full-screen with less stretching.Input/output including PC, component, and digital optical audio.USB for pictures, video, music, thought limited formats.Packaged really well and easy to setup.Easy menus.== Cons ==Horribly weak sound.Anti-reflective screen SPREADS light reflections and actually makes it HARDER to view the picture.Wobbly stand: Set acts like a pendulum side-to-side if bumped.No Audio Return Channel (Doesn't send audio via HDMI to a theater system).Only 2 HDMI inputs, no S-Video input.No backlighting on the remote controlSlow to startup when turned on.TV cannot change HDMI inputs on the Sony Theater system, despite both being Bravia and syncing correctly.Thin owner's manual.For the way I use a TV, I am satisfied with my warranty replacement TV.  Based on my multiple bad experiences with Samsung, I am extremely glad to have a Sony-branded product.If I was purchasing a TV for myself, I would NOT go with the traditional LCD with CCFL (fluorescent) backlighting, I would definitely spring for LED backlighting.  I would need to buy an external audio system either way.

My only gripe is the corners that hold the case to the iPad have a tendency to crack or break
I'm on my second case, and the same thing is happening.

$review_text.: I upgraded from an old wireless g router and I saw a huge boost in my speeds compared to my old router

I upgraded my internet to 50 down and 5 up (Through TWC)

In my home I run 1 top line gaming rig, 2 Macbook Pros with wireless AC, 2 iPhones, 1 Asus laptop, 3 various tablets, and a HTPC computer running Plex


I do a lot of streaming through my network locally to devices from my HTPC server that is running Plex Media Server


The speed is amazing and haven't had any problems with the fast AC and N speeds especially to my MBP.Wireless-N:The wireless N is only rated at 450Mbps compared to the ac68U


However, all my devices on wireless N are super fast and utilize the bandwidth the N provides.Wireless-AC:Due to only having 2 MBPs utilizing the wireless AC, I can attest to the reliability of the AC connection and the speeds when streaming and transferring large files between computers and to the USB drive I connected to the router

Transferring a 4gb file is lightning fast when utilizing AC


The 66U's 1300Mbps AC speed is fully utilized by my tasks and can't wait to see how a higher speed in the future will run.Pros:-Simple and intricate UI for administrators.-Set up a separate 'guest' wireless to limit guests' access to and within your network.-Easy setup within minutes!-Firmware updates can be done within the actual admin console and is fast and easy to do

Just click update and sit back and relax!-Range is by far one of my favorite perks

In a 2 story apartment this unit can connect to devices that are 3 apartments away (around 30ft through brick and metal)!-Reliability is top notch and haven't had any issues with drops or intermittent signal.-USB 2.0 ports are very useful and allowed me to create my own 'cloud' that can sync to my tablets, phones, and computers

Connecting a USB drive to one of the two USB ports will allow you to create your own NAS for easy storage and retrieving.-Functionality is high with this router


Within the admin UI, you can set up your own personal cloud, media servers, and more! The cloud is by far my favorite function since i've maxed out my Dropbox account with files and needed my own cheaper way to store files and make them accessible whenever I need them.-Price: The price at the moment is a steal for a high end AC router

I bought mine for $230 at the time since it was one of the only top line AC routers.-Mounting: The packaging includes a small stand you can stand your router up
I stand mine up behind the TV where it cannot be seen.-Construction is hardcore and withheld many 8 ft drops onto the floor when I was trying to DIY mount to the wall near the ceiling.Cons:-The firmware does not allow the use of Time Machine with an external hard drive connected to the router

The AC68U has this capability and I will soon think about upgrading to that model.-Mounting: No wall mounting capability.In conclusion, wireless AC is already becoming implemented into our daily devices

Apple has made AC a part of their new line of MBP this past year and their tablets and iphones will soon be using this technology
The investment into this router is future-proofing your home and yourself to get the most out of your wireless and router
The router also boasts massive Gb speeds in case you have access to the high end fiber optic internet lines such as google fiber
If you are in the market for a router that will last you a very long time and provides you the functionality, efficiency, and reliability you need for your busy household, the ASUS RT-AC66U is your one-stop go when pairing effectiveness and price

My only suggestion is to go with the 68U if you want the Apple Time Machine capability with your own hard drives connected to the router and need a USB 3.0 port.

$review_text.: I've owned several products from Jlabs before these; I think this is the first thing from jlabs with which I've been anything other than pleased.I love my j3 ear phones.  Great sound quality for a very reasonable price.  My only problem is that they seem to pop out of my ears when I'm up and about; I wanted to find some way to keep using the ear phones at the gym or while walking.  Sadly this doesn't appear to be the solution.The problem with the jlab earhook for me was the size of the hook, and the thickness of the rubber plastic.  It's just too thick and stiff to hold the wires in place, and I found it difficult to position.  I guess I'll have to look for another solution!

I am an avid gamer and a budding guitarist, and I recently bought a new gameRocksmith(imagine Rock Band or Guitar Hero, but with an actual guitar). It didn't occur to me that using a HDMI cord for sound would mean digital conversion, thus a nagging delay. However, I used this puppy and the AV wires for the PS3 to hook up to my speakers, and viola no delay.

Tools are very well constructed, screw drivers are magnetized very helpful when dealing with the tiny screws. I highly recommend using a large piece of white paper when disassembling so if you drop a screw you can see it well they are very tiny.

$REVIEW.: Neat addition to have move stoage for media like JPEGS or MP4 files  for use with the NEus 7 tablet that maxes out at 32 GB internal storage only. Beware that the tablet will not support this as a natively recognized storage drive even on Android 4.4.  I installed an app from the google play store ((Nexxus Media Importer)  for 4.99 that will allow the dive to work and access files wihtout a problem.  The device works well without any of the more difficult to install solutions advocated by others such as reflashing a hacked OS.

$review_text.: I received the Pink 2nd Gen 4GB Apple iPod Nano as a surprise gift. I'd long wished for this baby, and I couldn't be happier with it. It is beautiful and tough--seriously, when I'd played with my friends' first-gen Nanos I was terrified I was going to snap it in half. This iPod doesn't feel like a toy; its heavy enough to feel good and strong. Still, I keep it in a wallet because I'm paranoid like that.PROS:~4 GB is plenty of space for most people. I have 806 MB left over after putting most of my music library and 35 pictures on it. It is honestly PLENTY of space.~Love the color choices. The choice of black or white in the first nano was a big dealbreaker for me.~Pictures look great, you can have tons on there, you don't have to format them to put them on, just choose an iPhoto album or the whole dang library.~Music plays beautifully, all the time. Expect nothing less of Apple.~Album art showing up is a fun touch.~Its in Color, which makes a huge difference. The screen is more lovely than any iPod i've ever seen, and better than any PDA too, for that matter.~Lots of good options, like search, settings, extras, photos, music, etc.~Plenty of icons to let you know which settings you have on.~Sleep timer! For an insomniac like me, I have to have music to go to sleep. Its great that I can set it to 30 minutes, put it on my Sleepy playlist, and I'm out, plus it'll automatically turn off after 30 minutes so that you don't have to worry about battery or get woken up by a sudden screamo song.~Comes with good earphones.~Tons of other pros. It is way cooler than I ever imagined.CONS:~You can't use the nano to delete songs. You have to upload it on to the computer and then delete the songs.~It doesn't come with any exterior speakers, a dock, a user's manual, or an outlet charger. The only things in the box are the nano, headphones, a cord to connect it to the computer (which charges it and lets you put all the music on it) and a quickstart guide. You can only charge it using the computer and can only listen to it using the computer's speakers when it is plugged into the computer.Overall, it is a beautiful and amazing machine. I would buy them for everyone I know. The perfect adorable little music device. Apple's done it again. I would recommend it to anyone who loves music.UPDATE (01/07) Its been almost a month now, and the thing is WAYY cooler than you could possibly imagine. Yeah, there's no manual, but it is easy to figure out if you play with it a little. It just is made with a technology you can't match anywhere else. Lots of these reviews don't understand the technology that goes into every iPod...really, its incredible. I'm like....wow.

$REVIEW.: I volunteer with the American Red Cross Disaster Services group, am a NOAA-trained weather spotter, and am also a licensed amateur radio operator, active with our local emergency response group. So I know a bit about weather emergencies and have played with a few radios.This is a decent radio, but not the only one you'll want if you live somewhere with a reasonable chance of sudden weather incidents that could cause significant damage (tornadoes are the most common in parts of the country, but could include other things).The nice things about this radio:* It's light and portable.* It can serve as a flashlight (the brightness is decent).* AM/FM, plus the NOAA weather channels.* Can be set to be activated by the warning alert tone, basically turning on when there's a weather statement, watch, or warning (but this drains the battery quickly).* Can charge other devices if absolutely necessary (your cell phone, for instance; note that while it will work, you'll also want a better charging option).* Charges via USB, solar, or hand crank.* Digital readout. Don't need to guess which AM/FM or NOAA station you might be on.Why it ain't perfect:* It doesn't have all the features (and charging options) as a slightly more expensive portable radio like theAmbient Weather WR-334-U Emergency Solar Hand Crank Weather Alert Radio, Flashlight, Siren, Smart Phone Charger* It doesn't have SAME alert technology, which greatly localizes and provides options for the alerts it turns on for.* It isn't designed for continuous operation. You won't be leaving this one on all the time by your bedside to sound an alert when an event occurs. For that, you want a radio with an AC adapter (using batteries only as a backup power source), and NOAA's SAME alert technology. Something like theMIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio.* Not the best sound quality in the world. Stations are clear, but not that clear. This radio isn't optimized for audiophiles (but doesn't really need to be).Note that while the lithium ion battery it comes with is rechargeable, they have a lifespan of about 3-4 years after manufacture before they don't hold a full charge as well anymore. This applies whether they're used or not. If you're going to stash this radio away in a portable emergency kit (and this is a good radio for that), I'd suggest getting a replacement battery every few years. A new one should run about 5 bucks, but note that there are both rechargeable and non-rechargeable CR123a lithium batteries. You want the rechargeable kind (RCR123a). I would greatly prefer it if this radio could run on AA or AAA NiMH rechargeables, which I have in abundance (including decent solar charging options like theGoal Zero Guide 10 Plus Adventure Kit. The pricier Ambient Weather radio linked to up above can, and I'd prefer that one over this one if I had the budget for it.Anyway, this is a nice portable radio for emergencies.  Rather than just stashing it away and forgetting about it, take it out and use it every once in a while though, so you and your family know that it works, and how to use it. Same for everything you have stored away "just in case". Doesn't help if you're not comfortable using it.

$REVIEW.: I am happy with the headphones,as they might only be $28 they sound great with decent bass. They are by no means a set of Bose so dont expect them to sound that way and you wont be dissapointed. There were a few people who complained about build quality and I would have to disagree with them! They feel very sturdy ! They do fit a little snug but I'm sure they will loosen up after some use.Someone said that the foam isnt thick enough and that the speakers touch their ears,I think it's just a case of chubby kid with dumbo ears honestly. I wear a 7.5 hat and have respectably sized ears and they dont touch. I would have liked the foam to be a little better. Why dont manufactures use memory foam ? That would be nice if your like me and have gaming sessions that last 8+ hrs. As far as the guy who wrote that the adjustable head band broke&lt; I say wellthey probably got mad when someone Pwned and they eneed up being thrown at the wall. For less than $30 your gonna get a pretty good set of head phones,BTW dont think because they are a closed unit that it means they are noise cancelling by any means just less outside noise,refer back to the Bose comment.

People don't even know it is a camera, they think it is a purse.  Don't hesitate getting this camera case.  It is terrific.*****2011 Update!!  I purchased another case because I let me mother borrow my camera and somehow the camera strap was lost.  When I received the new case, the case itself looks exactly the same but the  strap is different. The strap no longer comes with the metal clip.  All you get it the normal black nylon string that you can loop through and then feed the strap through the black string.  It makes the camera case look cheap compared to when I received the case with the meal clip on it.  I just wanted to warn you that you are not getting what you see in the picture, at least for the red camera case.

$REVIEW.: No qualms, a great piece of equipment at a reasonable price. I have placed mine in a narrow place because I don't have a large living room. The sound is wonderful.

$review_text.: I really wanted something to protect my new 13&#34; MacBook Pro Retina (Late 2013) body from scratches and little dings on the aluminum, and this Mosiso cover fits it perfectly. The material comes packaged in two layers of clear plastic shrink wrap. The clips on the screen back are strong enough to hold it to the back of the screen, but they don't really dig into the aluminum to mar it, and that made me really happy. The material itself isn't a tinted translucent, and it is solidly dyed through. However, the Apple logo still glows through it, just not as bright. The cover adds about 1mm around the screen.The bottom cover has some grill cut outs to let heat build up escape, and some white foam feet that aren't as sturdy as the built in black ones from Apple. Also, the bottom cover has a lip that extends about 1mm above the edge of the actual MacBook Pro edge, and it's a little uncomfortable for my wrists, so I don't keep it on for longer typing sessions. Removability isn't bad at all; I never felt like I was damaging the MacBook Pro taking it off or putting it on. I think it gives adequate protection, but I'm a little concerned about trapping heat that could potentially damage the internals. I'm going to experiment with the bottom cover a bit more, and I hope Mosiso can mill down the bottom cover lip without it falling off.Overall, I'm impressed with the Mosiso cover. It's really well made and fits well, and the rubberized material has a great level of color depth on the Robin's Egg Blue / Hot Blue version. It feels really good in the hand and not slippery at all.
$SUMMARY.: Well made case for Late 2013 MacBook Pro 13" Retina

$REVIEW.: I don't know what this is supposed to be used for but if you want to run your Sigma DP Merrill camera off a portable USB power supply, this is the way to do it
 You still need the AC adaptor for that model (SAC-5) to convert battery to type H barrell

I have this wire between the SAC-5 battery part and a 12000maH USB battery pack
Make sure its a 2 amp charger though..

reliability is a problem in a 1 amp charger

 I shoot 1000 frames of timelapse and the battery still claims a quarter of a charge left.I know this is a niche item but if you need to plug a H barrel into a USB port, this is your cable.



$SUMMARY.: Used for Sigma DP1 Merrill, works great

$REVIEW.: After looking through the reviews before purchasing, I was unsure if this combined withRND Power Solutions Dual Black USB AC Adapter / Wall charger for Tablets Smart Phones MP3 Players and Gaming Devices including Apple (iPad iPhone iPod iTouch) Blackberry (Torch) HTC (Evo 4G) Motorola (Droid Series) Samsung (Galaxy Series Tab) & many morewould charge the iPad 2.It does charge the iPad 2

 The six foot length makes it easier to use the iPad while it is charging.

$REVIEW.: I really love this BLURAY player. It can play MKV files from any USB devices, DVD-R or BluRay discs that you burned yourself. It loads everything extremely fast. Easy to use. If you are hesitance of buying one then you are a fool and missing out THE BEST player out there.FYI, when you're updating the firmware. If you're connected by HDMI then you should switch over to video composite because the player will reset to that and you will get a "no connection" message from your tv set. When you're in Composite you will then need to switch back to HDMI in setting option otherwise you will feel the need to turn off your player or feel that the machine is broken.When you in composite video connection. Go to SETUP > PLAYER SETTING > OTHERS > select RESTORE DEFAULT SETTINGS to be able to use the HDMI conection again.
$SUMMARY.: LOVE IT!

$REVIEW.: I bought these stands because of their ultra wide footprint (3' from leg to leg). They make me feel secure about anything I put onto them.These are pretty heavy because they are made of steel. I prefer this over the aluminum ones, but the weight of all three stands (12 lbs) might not be for you if you are doing outdoor shots that require hiking or long distance walking.The bag these things come with is decent. The only problem is that it's an extremely tight fit. So tight, that when I received my first set of light stands, two of them had dents in them (the stands must have bumped against each other during shipment). My second shipment also had a stand that was dented. To fit all three stands in the bag, you have to face the 1/4 20 of the two outer stands pointing towards the closing of the zipper, and the middle with it's 1/4 20 facing the opposite way (it'll make sense when you try it out). If they added padding to the bag and made it a bit larger, then it would be absolutely perfect.The knobs and locking collars are made out of plastic. They seem to work fine, but I don't know how long they will last. The collars are also easily removable, so if you strip the threads on one, I think Linco can offer you a new one (I THINK). Just make sure to not over tighten, and you should be good.Spreading the legs out can be really easy, or really difficult. One of my stands spreads with ease, but the other two require a decent push to open them up.The legs are secured by a plastic mold when collapsed. The plastic mold helps prevent the legs from spreading on their own, but I must admit it is annoying to have to separate each leg from the mold each time I use these stands.The threaded 1/4 20 stud on top is made of aluminum and looks really cheap. I'm sure if I ever used it, the threads would start to deform on me since every 1/4 20 attachment I have is made of steel.The spring inside the stands help to prevent accidents, but it probably wouldn't help with heavy lights. The springing action starts at the very bottom of the poles and won't be able to cushion a lot of weight.Overall, I think it was a solid buy. If you're stands come dented, I would suggest calling Linco up and asking for a replacement. I wish I did that. I returned my set through Amazon, just to get another dented stand when my new set came in. Luckily it's a small dent, and would probably occur during outdoor use anyway.Hope this review was helpful!
$review_summary.: Great Stands


Will Buy More Soon.
