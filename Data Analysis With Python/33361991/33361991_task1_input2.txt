I've had it a few weeks and ran it down close to empty and recaharged several times. It has a life comparable to the original battery when it was new.

$REVIEW.: These headphones work fine with my TV and enable me to have late night private listening without disturbing others.  I only use them within 10-20 feet of the base station and do not have problems with maintaining a solid connection.However, there are some niggling details that bother me:1. there is a very low-frequency, low volume &#34;motor boating&#34; background noise that is audible during quiet scenes. Mostly it is ignorable but I now find myself listening for it. Changing to one of the other two channels does not remove the noise.2. there are occasional &#34;pops&#34; that occur randomly, generally a few minutes apart. Again, they are mostly ignorable.3. these earpieces are huge and the strap/flexible support between them is also visually arresting. When a colleague saw me wearing these headphones, he thought they were some 1960's antique I had found.4. the wire on the base stand that must be plugged in to charge the internal batteries is a nuisance. I can see the designers adopted this system to avoid the situation where the headphones are always on charge when placed in the base (via contacts that mate when you set down the headphones). However, in this day of availability of batteries without memory effects, this is an unnecessary precaution. The result is that I must remember to plug in the charger cord every few days depending on my estimate of how many hours of use the headphones have had.For the cost (under $50) they are sonically OK but if I were making a purchase again I would look for a more modern design where automatic charging occurred when the headphones were returned to the base station. I would also be looking for a more contemporary appearance or a pocket device that would let me plug in my iPhone earbuds.
$SUMMARY.: TV wireless headphones - bulky and old fashioned.

$review_text.: The only reason I purchased this Blu-ray player was for the included streaming services and have no intention on using any optical media with it because I'm content with my Panasonic DMP-BD55.For anyone wanting to purchase a BD player then their expectations should be 1080p HD video with DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD audio choices.  Then why should your streaming video and audio be any different?  The simple answer is bandwidth.  But we should have at least some kind of HD, right?  Some content providers only stream SD while others stream HD but forget that surround sound is part of the HD experience.I didn't want to go the HTPC route and just wanted a streaming device capable of streaming up to 1080p and supporting surround sound and cost around one Benjamin.  I tried the roku xds and it failed miserably for me because there was absolutely NO WAY to manually configure network settings; the only network device I've encountered that you can't do that simple function.  I was also not impressed that it only had Netflix, Amazon and many ghetto-quality channels.  Streaming quality of Amazon and Netflix varied and wasn't consistent.I then tried the Western Digital TV Live Plus and was initially impressed with it's consistent stream quality but there wasn't much more for true movie channels.  Watching independent web content on the big screen isn't my idea of fun, leave that for computer use when you're bored.  All the extra capabilities of the WD like watching local content from different storage devices and LAN were of no use to me since I stick to my optical media for local content.I should have stuck with my initial instinct and went with a BD STB even though there was that optical feature I wouldn't use.  I only found one STB vendor that carried Slacker Radio, the only worthy music streaming service worth using, but the combination wasn't right and unfortunately it was a sony.  I wound up selecting the BDX2500 because it had a mix of complimenting services:  vudu, Netflix and Blockbuster.  It would have been nice if Amazon was included with the player but it's a good compromise since the real winning combination is vudu and Netflix.  Besides, my HDTV can already stream Amazon.  With my XBOX 360 and the Zune service along with my FiOS HD premium channels and on-demand, I'm pretty much covered and sure fo find any movie I'd ever want to see.  As for ANY web content, it belongs on a computer and not on my plasma.  You can have your google TV and all those overpriced wanna-be low budget HTPCs.  You're better off getting a Netbook and keeping it near your HT HDTV if you really need to access the web cheaply.  If it's a size thing then get your quick web fix with an Android device like the G2.  I didn't bother with hulu because I'm not into any of it's content.  I also don't care about being able to watch video on a computer, that's what my TVs are for.I initially just wanted to stream Netflix in HD but unfortunately they max out their experience with just 720p and stereo audio with few titles available.  They are improving their selection but I really want to have surround sound as part of that experience.  Apparently the ps3 has 1080p and surround sound availability now.  Someone sold out!  They really should roll out the update to ALL platforms before the end of the year!The Blockbuster service is nothing to write home about since the little I played with was only SD and not the best streaming but comparable to Netflix SD.  They offer a similar plan to Netflix but with Blu-ray included at no additional cost and with the addition of having the opportunity to drop off and pick up locally.  I still have to look into what the Streaming offer is.  I was given a free trial with activation of the player along with a five buck credit for use on a movie.  I'll look for some old obscure movie since watching it on SD wont be a loss.I tried Pandora and it's, well, Pandora.  I'd rate it perhaps #2 behind Slacker and don't see getting any use from it since I've had Pandora on my plasma and don't use it.And now vudu|movies.  Yes, rentals available in SD, 720p and 1080p with 5.1 Dolby Digital Plus!  I got a $6 credit for registering and saw Predators last night.  Wow, streaming never looked or SOUNDED so good!  This is the hands down winner of all the streaming movie services.  Yes, it's not Netflix all-you-can-eat, and you have to rent (or buy) the movies BUT you're getting NEW movies when they're released for sale a lot of the times.  This is one of the beefs I have with Netflix and their lack of any new movie available for streaming.  The interface also includes a nice and helpful connection test to let you know what type of stream is best for you.Now for those who are looking for more than just movies, the player INCLUDES vudu|apps.  I've gone through several of these and the entire vudu interface is the best I've used with ANY streaming service.  It's fast, responsive, modern looking and has good search options.  People and reviews are missing additional "channels", streams or content because they have not looked at the vudu|apps option where there is plenty to offer.  We're not talking ghetto-content here, we're talking real quality and commercial stuff you find on real TV.  There is some of the indy stuff but there's quality over quantity here.  You can find out more at [...].  If you're looking for a vudu enabled device then check this out, but make sure you select the correct devices that have vudu apps enabled. [...]One thing this player has that none of other steaming devices can touch is boot time.  I press the power button (yes, it really has one) and it's up in the main menu in 2 seconds.  With the other devices I mentioned, you have time to go make some popcorn before it comes up (kind of like loading a Blu-ray movie).  I can boot my notebook, log in, launch a web browser and get to this web page BEFORE those devices finish booting into the main menu.Here are some random numbers while testing.Power On:  2 secondsPower Off:  1 secondSelecting the following services from the main menu until the service loads to it's main menu:Pandora:  10 seconds to authenticate and begin playing last channelvudu|apps:  11 secondsvudu|movies:  3 seconds (from within vudu|apps menu)Netflix:  18 seconds to instant queueBlockbuster:  21 secondsFirmware v1.14 06/21/10 (shipped and no other updates were found when I tried updating)I got it at my local BB for a buck twenty with a free Toshiba Wireless-N USB Adapter (WLM-10UB1).  I went for this model because I didn't need WiFi but the free adapter was a bonus.  This adapter does 802.11 a/b/g/n and operates at 2.4GHz and 5.2GHz.  All you do is plug it into the rear USB port and it just works without any sign of it installing itself.  Boot time was not affected by having it plugged in.  The interface for the adapter is pretty decent and it was nice that apart from the normal open, SSID and signal strength indicators, it shows the AP's capabilities (i.e. a/b/g/n).  I'm not using the wireless adapter, only wired.And a short word on streaming video.  If you can help it then please, please, please use at least a wired Fast Ethernet connection because you'll be able to get consistent and reliable bandwidth.  The next important thing is to make sure you have at least a 10Mb ISP connection.  If you MUST use wireless then you really should use 802.11n in the 5GHz band.  Remember, wireless is a convenience and good for your MOBILE devices to access non-bandwidth intensive content.  Not everyone is capable of streaming dependable HD via wireless, yet.In short, I found this is better product than a stand-alone "Digital Video Player".  I didn't comment on the BD component since I don't care about it.

$REVIEW.: Easily got dust, a lot of dust, under the lens, when I used a piece of tissue paper to wipe it and blew. If tissue lint can get in it, so can dust. I tried vacuuming it out but that didn't work. The photo quality was ok, macros were okay. A few pics were very good, but not great. Still waiting to be able to afford a camera with easy ISO control, this wasn't one. The zoom was SUPER SLOW and I lost critical pics as a result. Uncomfortably heavy too. It did have this cool high dynamic range setting though, which got an awesome pic, but that was it, no other beautiful ones.Overall, hated this camera.

$REVIEW.: All the user comments who have said this is a very noisy drive are indeed correct. Plus the wonderful blue LED light is a great nightlight ... there's no need for any other light to wander around the office in the dark if the drive's turned on.However, none of this is an issue for me anymore because I inadvertently knocked the drive over when I jumped up to help my child in a not-quite-emergency-but-you-know-how-parents-are suitation.  I was using the included stand at the time.The drive immediately proceeded to grind itself into oblivion -- and quite loudly!  I'm obviously not going to blame the drive for failing in this situation, but there are three design changes that could have been made to make this less likely: a wider stand; putting the USB cable plug at the bottom of the drive rather than near the top so a yank is more likely to pull than tip; and including a six foot rather than a three foot USB cable so there's more room to move when using a laptop.A piece of masking tape fixes the bright light, and not using the stand would keep it from falling over, but I would not buy this drive again simply for the noise issue alone.

$review_text.: Does the sound on your new flat screen television sound tinny?  Are you tired of blaring commercials and their volume's increasing over your program setting?  Is dialog unclear or does background noise/music interfere with your hearing a character's speech?  If so, you may want to do what we did and purchase a ZVOX 555.Delivery, even with "super saver shipping" was quick and the unit arrived in pristine shape


 Set-up took only 5 minutes - the majority of that time was spent placing the unit; all required cables are included with the ZVOX 555
 Clear, concise directions allowed us to program control, using our cable provider's remote, the ZVOX 555 - no multiple remotes needed here.As tone-deaf, non-audiophiles, we were amazed by the depth of tone and clarity of sound the ZVDOX 555 produced


 Our "mature" ears can now hear voices clearly - since receiving our ZVOX 555 we no longer have to ask "what did they say?"  (We set the unit on "SD1" which minimizes surround sound and emphasizes vocals


 Most individuals will prefer the "SD2" setting" as it provides a truer surround sound.)  Further, the conflict regarding the volumes which we individually prefer and set has disappeared; we now agree on that point
 The ZVOX 555's best feature may be the way it controls the volume on commercials so that their volume are no louder than the volume of the program you are watching.We like the ZVOX 555 so much that we plan on purchasing a second one
 Budget conscious individuals may want to purchase, as we did, a ZVOX refurbished unit on Amazon

 The savings is significant and ZVOX's customer service is as responsive as Amazon's.NOVEMBER 15 UPDATE:  We have had our second ZVOX 555 for a week and it is every bit as nice a unit as the first one

 We thought it was not working correctly and called ZVOX; they were extremely nice and very helpful
 We learned that you need to use your TV's remote to go to settings where you need to turn the TV speakers "off."  You will then get another option, such as "auxiliary," which will make the ZVOX your audio source


 The instructions do not tell you that tidbit; hopefully, this will help others who, like my spouse and me, do not use sound systems or are moving to the new technologies.

$review_text.: Remember when you had no idea how you would ever fill a 20GB hard drive? Why on earth would they even sell $2,000 computers with that immense storage capacity, and yet here we are regularly buying HDD in the terabytes for all of our video, music, and document storage. The Seagate NAS drive is meant to be used as network storage, however it can be used in a personal computer as well. Since we only have one computer at home which is already connected to our other portable devices, this drive gave us some much needed breathing room on our 800 GB HDD. Install took less than 30 minutes. It is lightning fast and quiet. If the price is right for you, I can recommend it. If I run into any problems down the road I will update this review.

$review_text.: I bought this kit ONLY for the cubbie unit, as sure to fit with the same type, but for Auto Climate Control units, as in my 2007 Subaru Outback.  Because I am installing a single din HU.  I could not find a cubbie box for under the HU so I bought this and eat the extra price for the reset of the kit (face plate).  Again, to make sure the cubbie din fits right.Nothing will work for Subarus with digital auto climate control A/C unit except this.[...]Pricey as it comes with a new A/C unit and then the double din opening above it. The HU is tied to the A/C unit for the auto A/C types. So, no options if you want aftermarket HU. I ordered mine and should arrive in a few days.  Also order the Hazard Button from the same site, as this one is on the other side.  One other draw back, coming from Japan the temp read outs are in celsius, not big deal to me.You also need the i88 adapter ($25) that goes from the head unit to this auto climate contol unit.

$REVIEW.: Sony has done it again.  They took a really good product and made it mediocre.  This is supposed to be the 3rd generation upgrade of their new line of  Video Walkman Mp3 players.  You would think it would be better than the 600 and 700 series players.  Well, in IMHO it is not.Yes, they added the radio,extended the battery life to an amazing 45 hours,added more and support for a couple of other video formats,and improved the build quality  but come on Sony, the most important feature of an mp3 player is the Sound.This one does not sound nearly as nice or clean as the 600 and 700 series Walkmans. If you have never heard the other Sony players, then you might think this one is great, but it does not compare to the older models in sound quality.There are several sound enhancements that were included in the earlier versions of this player that are missing here.  There is no VPT ( Virtual Surround), No Clear Stereo, No DSE and no Bass Enhancement.  And most of all, the volume capability seems to be about 60 % of what you got on the older units.  That may be how Sony got the extra 12 hours of battery life.The tuner in the older units was awesome, this tuner is very weak.  I compared the two units side by side, and it is not just a little weak, it is almost unusable.The video does seem to be about the same as the older players,which was very good,  and they did increase the size of the screen, but video was not a very important feature for me.Shame on Sony.....  I bought this to give as a gift to friend and I am now to embarrased by the performance to give it as gift. I am taking this unit back,and I already ordered another 600 and 700 series unit while they are still available on clearance.

$review_text.: If you own an interchangeable lens DSLR, then you need an air bulb blower for sensor cleaning and Giotto makes the best. There are several different models that Giotto makes ant the AA1900 is the largest and most powerful. I also use the air blaster for cleaning the dust from all kinds of electronic gear and its power will surprise you. I have several of these blowers around my house and in my camera kit.Caution: The AA1900 is a powerful blower. When blowing the dust out of the sensor chamber on a DSLR make sure to tilt the camera (lens side downward 45 deg) and only use gentle puffs of air. Too strong a puff could actually send dust up into the prism head, where it is almost impossible to remove.

$review_text.: I use this with a $40 outdoor antenna that is only about 6' off the ground. This is the 4th USB tuner that I have owned and the best (and cheapest) one of the lot.  I get 30+ channels (including all Major HD local channels) and I live far away from most broadcasting stations.  Pluses-It only turns on when Windows Media Center is opened and a channel selected from the guide. Prior USB tuners came on when the PC came on.  Because of this, this tuner does not overheat.  Previous tuners, after even a few minutes of coming &#34;on&#34; became almost too hot to touch.  And after several hours of use this item is still only slightly warm to the touch...no chance of getting burnt!Not so cool- the software is buggy.  I get more channels and more selections/options using Media Center.  With Media Center it is a true DVR, with pause and RW, FFW and recording.  I can pause for up to 35 minutes and return to watch the show in it's entirety, while FFW through the ads.  I do get some different channels using the software, but I prefer the Media Center channels to the ones the software will pick up and using the software is not as intuitive as Media Player.Conclusion:  Buy it. Go ahead and load the software to see what channels it gets in your area, but also set up Media Player for the best experience.  Right now I have 1 antenna pointed to the NNW.  I plan to get another one, mount it on top of the first one (using a &#34;y&#34; connector for the coax cable) and find the best direction to pick up another 20 or so channels.

Now the first and last named bags really pack a gob of gear, no doubt but my latest purchase, the Urban Disguise 40V2 is just right for most of my day trip shooting.Excuse the analogy to the 3 Bears but for me it works.The Urban Disguise 40V2 caries my 70-200mm, 8-16mm, 30mm or 60mm macro and my uber strobe and my 7D body with room for lens cleaning brushes, micro cleaning cloths, tidy wipes, batteries and other assorted items plus, with the additional attachment straps my tripod or monopod (think medieval mace) for keeping the bears away, no affiliation with the title bears.I have read other reviews on Think Tank products and believe that when I happen upon a product that works well for me and my purposes I do tend to support that product(s) until it no longer does so.Conclusion;While this may be a tongue-in-cheek review crossed with a children's story the facts are I am happy with the Think Tank line of products I have tried.An Amazon order filled by Norman Camera, or was that the other way around?  It cannot be beat for time of delivery, packing and quality assurance.

$review_text.: Since this charger gives a reading on each individual battery, it is easy to cull out any bad cells.  We have so many electronics around the house that use AA that we really give them one heck of a test.  Though the batteries have a high power rating, their life cycle was shorter than others we use.  I didn't keep track of how long they were in use, but we had some other brands in use before we got these and the others are working better now that time has past.  You will get plenty of use out of these batteries though.  I would definitely recommend this setup.

$review_text.: yes, programming this remote is very simple and very easy to use. It only took me about half an hour to set up maybe less. I was very impressed with how the unit interfaced with everything. That said, within two weeks the bottom of the LCD display started to not display properly and I've only had this product for a little over a month and I've already had to replace the batteries. I would recommend going one step higher! I think I'm going to try...Update: This product is completely starting to fail me completely! It burned through the most recent set of batteries in two weeks and the display is now completely unreadable! As soon as I can afford it I'm going to upgrade.

The interior shed a little bit of its orange lining intially but that went away and I am left with a nicely designed sleeve that serves its function.  The 16" size is a nice fit even for a 15" system and I use excess as a kind of handle.  The zipper is high quality never snagging with a super durable feel to its handle and action.

$REVIEW.: A quite expensive, but worth it!The noise cancelling is AWESOME, it cancels almost every sound but not too much the high-pitched noises like women voices but still makes it really low

The only con is that you feel like if you were at the bottom of a pool, weird at the beginning but you will enjoy your music and get used to


Actually the best in the market


Another bad thing is that it will be so quiet and crystal clear that if you have bad quality songs you will know it and hate those songs, you will skip them!Sound is superb, crystal clear and balanced(Maybe not too much bass, if you want bass go with Beats or Rock equalizer)


There are some others headphones that sound a bit better but you won't even notice(this doesn't mean these sound bad, actually the sound is pretty good, REALLY good).Construction is plastic is GREAT, i don't have nothing to complain on those headphones about construction they feel really good and strong, just a bit large, but still looks cool
The headphones are big, not for tiny heads like childs even in the smaller size(it will fall off or move)
The cable is strong but is a bite long, a bit longer than the normal lenght so you will have to get rid of the lenght


By the way, REALLY COMFORTABLE.Love the AAA battery can replace it really easy, you can buy it everywhere and it's cheap or use an rechargeable one; the QC3 uses an lithium special battery (expensive and you will need to buy an extra one or replace it someday, and if you go out of charge you are done, no more music.)The case is pretty fine, hard but a bit big
I don't even use it, i'm always wearing those headphones

It has a little bag for batteries it has a velcro behind so you can take it down or turn it.You get an extra cable (with remote for apple products), airplane adapter, and a bunch of courtesy cards if someone ask you about these headphones.I don't have complains about the headphones i love them! I've had Senheisser, Bose, Sony, a BUNCH of headphones, normal ones (and in-ear) and cancelling ones.Maybe a bit expensive but worth it

By the way, Amazon customer service was great, i didn't receive the headphones at first, they were really helpful and fast! 1 minute after i opened the claim and was resolved, the send me a new ones! Received them the next day!

$review_text.: I have an old Dell that I am currently running Ubuntu Linux on and using as a media server as a "headless" machine. I also have a Windows machine that I built myself about 8 years ago, that is still running strong and is fast. Both of these machine have the older PS/2 keyboard and mouse connectors that this KVM & S switch uses. I also have a USB wireless keyboard mouse combo that I use on the self-built machine. I was pleased to find out once I connected both computer to the Syba KVM switch that I was able to use both keyboards and mice without an issue. I thought there might be some conflict, but there was none. As long as I kept the PS/2 connector from the KVM switch and the USB receiver plugged in both were functional (when the KVM was switched to that machine).The switch will default to the first machine that was turned on, but by clicking the CTRL key twice you can easily switch to the other machine when you power it up. I don't often look at the Linux machine, but on the occasion that I need to run updates or something this switch comes in handy. I did find an issue when switching back and forth between my Linux and Windows machine that happens quite frequently. That issue occurs with the graphics. The Linux machine would initially start at a much higher resolution before it was switched back and forth. The original resolution was set below the maximum 2048 X1536 pixels that this switch can handle, but when switched back the icons were much larger and the text was much bigger. The funny thing is that the Linux system reported that it was outputting the original higher resolution settings, not a lower resolution, so I can only assume the issue is with the switch. If I rebooted the Linux machine the full high resolution returned to normal. This would drive me nuts if I switched to this machine often, but since I don't it's not a real issue for me. Strangely enough I tried another Windows machine and could not duplicate this graphics issue. The box does clearly states "Multi-platform Support - Windows and Linux", so there should not be a compatibility problem there, but in my case, there is. Oh, one more thing to note on the video, the connector is the old-style HDB-15 connector. If your monitor uses DVI or HDMI connectors, they are incompatible with switch. There is no physical button to switch between the two machines, it must be done through the keyboard you attach to it. Setting up this switch is quite easy. You attach your keyboard, mouse, monitor and audio to the female jacks at the head of the device. There are two sets of cables that have male connectors which attach to the corresponding components on the two computers. Two LED's on the top of the device indicate which machine is active. The documentation included is basic, but so is the switch. According to the User Guide there is an "Auto Scan Mode" that you can set the interval, but it does explain what it in fact does, what is it scanning for? I'm not sure. With the ability to easily remote to machines these days. I'm not sure I understand why they would manufacture this switch any more, especially with such old school connectors, but I guess people have old machines like myself that they are using for other purposes. Since most people will likely be connecting this switch from a newer machine that only has a usb mouse and keyboard it might be beneficial to have USB connectors on the head of the switch that would convert the signal to the PS/2 connections. To upgrade the video connectors to HDMI or DVI might be a little bit tricky for this device though. To me it just seems that the Syba KVM switch is a bit after its time, in fact I had a similar KVM switch 8 years ago when I built my Windows machine.
$SUMMARY.: I'm not sure why they still make this, but if you have older computers it's not bad.

$REVIEW.: I bought this set while it was on sale. I had a good set from Coby that works for me when I am outside on my bike, or yard work. So if I lose them or it becomes damage, no big deal. However I wanted a nice middle quality Ear Plugs to use with my headphone extension cords when my spouse is sleeping, or traveling to my business trips. That's pretty important when your gone 13 hours per day. This work very excellent with my HP Laptop, Kindle Fire HD, my Generic Hong Kong MP3 Player, Toshiba Excite  Tablet, and my Pioneer Surround Sound. I have no issue about the quality of the sound, and I feel that some people are over analyzing it into the ground being self styled critics. I feel that "Koss" put together a pretty darn good set of Ear Plugs making it the best that they can to keep the price down while providing very reasonable quality sound. What is pretty rude is these chronic complainer's who spent the current price at the time this was written $9.99, and expect a $100.00 quality set of Ear Plugs. There is nothing wrong with that except, that if you want $100.00 worth of sound quality, then you must spend $100.00 to receive it. Manufactures are not in the business of giving their merchandise and services for free. Simply put you get what you pay for! Be happy with it, or you can always send it back to Amazon for a refund. For the price, it works well, fits well with their memory foam style earplugs, and I am very satisfied with it's performance! A+

 If you want a product that complements your cable DVR rather than replaces it, this is it
 It's so much easier to figure out what is on and switching between the web and TV is seamless

 I'm an Android phone and tablet user, so it is awesome to be able to use my devices as remotes for my entire home theater system
 There is still room for improvement, but I for one am very confident that this device will continue to receive software support from Google for some time to come
 They take care of their early adopters, and let's be honest, until recently most Revue owners have essentially been beta testers

 I am eagerly awaiting the update us Revue users should be receiving next week


 If you have a DVR and an HD-TV, I would recommend adding this device to your wishlist for the holiday season.

$review_text.: It plugs and works


Its power adapter carries a current of 3 Amp which is plenty to support a couple of external hard drives

However, the AC adapter end (the small one) that goes to this device is rather lose and it comes off unplugged occasionally when the device is moved around or the power cord is touched

When that happens my PC will not recognize the hard drive
This is quite disappointing.Update 6/29/2012This device has been working just fine for 14 months with occasional failures due to lose mini-USB port/plug and power port/plug
I had to tape both cables to secure them to the hub

Once that was done, no more failures had occurred


The vendor was quite generous and sent me a newer version yesterday at no charge
I tested the new device and verified both power plug/port and mini USB port/plug are tight and secure

 The cables are also longer which can further prevent accidental unplug if the hub is moved

This vendor apparently has demonstrated its commitment to customer satisfaction based on its customers feedback.

The screen appears to update in segments that are frequently out of sync with each other which is annoying but can be lived with.  More troubling is that the screen locks up when using it in map mode (no destination entered).  I use this in town so I can see what street I'm approaching as an aid areas I'm not familiar with but when the screen freezes (fails to update) it is useless.

$review_text.: After Receiving a New 80 GB VIDEO IPOD as a gift I tested out this new gadget and quickly opened the box. What comes included are Earbuds, USB Wire, Ipod unit and plastic cradle for accesories. First The Ipod Video comes with no CD. This is no big deal and actually becomes useless  once new versions of Itunes come out anyway. So I downloaded I tunes and was off to get my AVI Video onto the new IPOD. But later found out the IPOD only accepts MPEG-4. Coverting takes about 1 hour so I made some coffee. Once converted everything was simple , plugged in the ipod and it synched up and the video played fine. I then noticed aweful smudges on my brand new Ipod. Maybe smooth and pretty isn't actually smart for a device like this as fingerprints and scratches will soon make the new player look weeks old. Apple could have make finger proof case surface...but it would not be as shiny and cool looking. The interface is bright and easy to navigate with new games like pacman and Bejeweled at itunes store ready to download.Another thing missing from the box is any Charger. Except for the USB wire that charges The IPOD while hooked up to the computer , you must purchase one seperately. This  should have been included for $350.00If your buying a portable device your going to need a charger to plug into the wall sooner or later. While I felt that Apple could have added in AVI Compatibility, making it easier to use, its really a neat device to bring on long trips for music, games but as far as videos and movies go Watching a full movie on a 2.5 inch screen loses something and quickly get tired at staring at it. Not bad Apple but you could have done better.

$review_text.: let me say this first - I bought this lens from Amazon and returned it as I had accidentally ordered from another vendor as well. Having said this, the lens itself is excellent, though it does not support f2.8 I found this lens to be amazing in indoor conditions where minimal day light was present. Sharp, fast focusing, low noise, distortion is a bit high compared to other wide angels in the same range, but nothing that cannot be fixed in Lightroom. Buying this lens means one is really interested in wide angel format of photography as in landscape, nature etc. With wide angel I do not mean indoor large party groups or wedding photographs with more than 6 people in it. No, the distortion would not look good on human photographs unless the distortion is intended for creativity sake. One need to know photography tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, Photomatix etc. If not, then I would recommend think before buying any wide angel lens. Overall, very excited with new lens and with summer approaching it is now time to exploit this poor fella :)

$REVIEW.: Overall, this is a great remote.  However, there are a few caveats.Pros:- Easy to program- Decent ergonomics for a large remote- Volume/mute pass through is awesome!Cons:- Pre-programmed list is very limited.  My sound bar was not in the list, and neither were a number of my TV functions.  The easy to use learning feature made up for this, except for the point mentioned below.- Has trouble learning some of the functions from my Sony remote.  Sometimes it gives an error, and sometimes it reports success but is unable to play it back.  After a few tries, I got everything but pause and FF to work.  I might get those if I keep trying.- Narrow IR angle compared to other remotes.

$review_text.: I haven't encountered any of the issues with sound drops that others have. Instead, I've found that this is an excellent media streaming device and Blu-Ray player for the price; while it doesn't have all the options (3D playback, for instance) that higher-priced players have, it handles almost all media streaming services and does so with aplomb, even over Wi-Fi. It also even supports WPA2-AES, which is shockingly uncommon among lower end devices. All in all, this is a great player that I'm happy to recommend.

$review_text.: New phone....a little more patience and results that are night and day.Now I get a decent sound from a new phone without all the Dr Dre Beats crap messing with the output. While the headphones sound a little hollow and tend to be a bit heavy on the bass (not the super low stuff, but just above), they deliver a fine sound for the cost.Look it is not like this is a set of Bose $1000 headphones, but they do the job well for the cost. Actually, really well.Why I had such a negative experience earlier, I can only guess. But the new phone relies far less on the sound enhancements that Beats Audio ***may*** have been pushing into the mix (I actually do not know this...just speculating). Now with this very stock Virgin Mobile Supreme (ZTE Supreme), the sound is like night and day from before. I listened to movies, music vids and other items and it was great.The 4/5 reflects the quality of the output. It is not perfect, but for the cost...what do you want?***************Sounds like a tin can, no bass and basically worthless. Maybe I am doing something wrong (there sure are quite a few positive reviews!), but my experience has been the total opposite. I tried these with a few sources and the result is always the same. I even checked my Logitech G930 headphones side by side with the same source. The 930 worked great and these still stunk.I will give them another try and maybe I will find the issue. If I do, I will amend this review.

$review_text.: I was looking for a receiver with 2 hdmi outs.  That limited my choices.  After looking at an onkyo and a pioneer I settled on the sony. Largely because I was at best buy and it was on sale.  It had great features.  The Bluetooth worked seamlessly with my android phone. I never did get the airplay to work on my iPad, but I didn't try too hard. It worked great with the iMac.  The wireless connection was built in, no adapter required.  That was nice but not essential.  The 2 room hookup was a bit of a disappointment.  It would only work with analog signals so hdmi's, Bluetooth or any digital signal did not work.  I did know this when I bought it, but didn't think it would matter.  But the Achilles heel of this receiver, as noted in many other reviews is the hdmi signal.  Mine gave out after a month.  Interestingly enough, it was the ps3 and ps4 that it quit working with.  Sony products.  Satellite, xbox, Xbox one all worked fine.  So, I took it back best buy.  I really did like the receiver but do not trust its reliability.

$REVIEW.: I got this for my dad, who has one of these Chinese Android streamers

 The device uses HDMI which he runs through a splitter

 One leg to the 2nd floor TV and the other leg up to his bedroom on the 3rd floor

 Well, he comes over because it doesn't work.So I test it with my AppleTV and a Macbook (using miniDVI to HDMI)

 Both of these work

 In fact, I get his Android streamer to work, sort of.Here's the design problem ..

the way the IR plug connects to the HDMI adapter is, to put it bluntly, terrible

 It comes in from the side at a 90 deg angle
 On the Android streamer, the IR plug blocks the power cable

 If you push it in really hard, you can get it to connect, but then it didn't work as an IR extender
 It could be because of the strain put on the IR connection point, but I don't know.On my Apple TV, it worked because the power cord is on the other side
 Had I been using the aTV's optical out, I'd be out of luck
 A better design would have been for the IR connection to come in the back.So I guess using a 90 deg HDMI adapter is possibly the answer, but make sure you get the right adapter

 If it points down, it might not work.My dad said he had a female-female HDMI adapter, so I gave him an extra HDMI cable

 He's gonna try putting the InjectIR further away so that it doesn't block the power cable
 I think it'll work, unless the adapters and extra HDMI cable somehow blocks the IR signal.Other than that, it does what it's designed for (as tested on an AppleTV and a Macbook)

 And get an adapter or a short male-female HDMI cord with this
 In fact, they should include the short male-female HDMI cord in the box.Slick idea ..

terrible design
 Let's see the 2.0 version.

It cost me an additional $10 for shipping since I had given the company the benefit of the doubt and went past the free returns date but that's water under the bridge. The unit works like it should and that's the most important thing.Previous review:Edit Nov. 18, 2012:I'm still having issues with this model holding a charge. My observations over a couple months indicate it seems to lose it's charge after a day or so. Ambient is sending me a replacement battery and I'm hoping that will solve the problem.Initial review:Initially I had a problem whereby I could not change the Mode from WB but after talking with Ed at Ambient Technical Support I was able to take out the battery, press through the small hole underneath to reset it and voila! all modes could be changed.From what I can tell, having read Ed's comments on other users posts here and also calling and receiving live help from Ed, the support for this product is exceptional.I'm unable to receive the emergency broadcast stations at home but they do come in elsewhere. Though that's dissapointing I'm going to have to overlook that as I find it more important to have this.Lastly I've had to use the reset button twice now to get it to work, apparently after the battery drained even though it had been fully charged and went unused for about 2 weeks time. I was going to return it before the 30 days that Amazon would cover the return but am deciding to keep it even with these issues.

$REVIEW.: Having tried a D-Link DNS-320 and plenty of homebrew solutions, I was apprehensive about purchasing another piece of network gear that would not work as expected
 I tried FreeNAS, but it required a good amount of memory and seemed inefficient to keep a PC up all the time just for home network needs
 USB drives attached to routers worked well, but I wanted something more robust for media storage and Time Machine, preferring external drives for imaging of systems

 The DNS-320 had promise, but was buggy from the start
 As I continued to try and use it, it could not be consistently seen by the network, even after multiple resets


 You should be able to set it and forget it with such a device, in my opinion
 The software interface to the DNS-320 was clunky at best when it worked

 Obviously I do not recommend that model, which appears to be discontinued, thankfully, and is probably underpowered by today's standards


 The DS212j is definitely an upgrade from the DNS-320, which it should be given that it is twice as expensive, but still a good bargain considering all the functions it handles, including backup and media storage (although to be fair the NAS must still be backed up, for which I personally recommend using bare SATA drives in an USB cradle, swapping them out on regular basis and storing offsite and/or a home safe)


 And it works, allowing for OS X, PC, iOS, and Android access
 I can now see the network shares for Time Machine, iTunes, and other media

 It also has a neat option to allow for web camera recording directly to the NAS, which actually works as promised


 This is the low end of Synology's units, clearly made for home use, but it appears reliable in the few weeks of use, with no failures or issues
 Only minor quibble would be the alert sounds that appear to be on by default, and those were easily toggled to remain silent


 The software interface is easy to understand, with more features than I need, but nice to know they are there (and regularly updated)

 All around a great investment, just be sure to check the Synology website for approved drives (which you must add yourself)
 Definitely recommended.

$REVIEW.: As i havent read the manual yet i find the remote extremely difficult to deal with, but im thinking ill figure it out down the road. also there are 2 one for the other sound room which ill be anxiously waiting to set up. since i was awaiting all the equipment i ordered to set this hunk of metal up. Firstly i choose this unit for its audio attributes and it sounds fairly decent to me and would loved to have tested in on my main set in the living room where resides my martin logan purity set up with the pionner SC 27 at its heart to take on the more purists marantz as they seem to be equally priced well not really as this unit was on sale, 1250 vs 800 for the marantz. Both models are heading to the back seat where they are being replaced , if youre not into 3d then why bother go get yourself a deal on the older models i say top of the line for good prices why not. Now for the nitty gritty the marantx set is quite a beau as it looks well built and that copper plating is quite predominant so is the torodial transformer they put in for the sound section and all the RCAs are plated as well so kudos for marantz in continung their search for audio excellence. As inputs go its really a tonne. i have cut down on so many things as of late so its well enough for me not to complain about it.the unit is running a play station move , an oppo 83 blu ray player , emotiva erc 1 cd player , a screenplay sp 5000 did i say 2 hdmi video outs same as my sc 27 the reason i didint get me a pre amp se[erate as they are well way too expensive and a direct t v satellite receiver. All seem to work so the connections must be right. the speakers they are running for 5.1 surround THX is the magnepan system of 1.7 and the mmgw and the mmgc, the sound quality from the unit was really warm but a little to constrained for my liking but i blame them on my speakers, so i up graded right away by adding on a 2 channel power amp xpa 2 and that relaesed the unit in spades imaging , soundstage and depth just exploded. it seemed to let the rear surrounds and center channel breathe a little better, the pre out section that the unit has surprised me and all i can say is it can do it. my dining  room is where my reference system is and i compare everything to it and this combo challenged them really well. i ran the system in for 4 days continous and everyday it sounded better, when i finally get the time to read the owners manual ill get up to speed and write some more at a later date, so if u want a good audio section to be the herat of an av system get the marantz its better or on par with most out there. ps it does lack some detail when challenging the higher end systems but you gotta pay a lot more for audio nirvana,,, my 2 cents.systems tested, onkyo 3007 my kitchen setup hah hah wife went on holiday and i upgraded everything with last years heros, denon 3805 , pioneer sc 27 , musical fideluty A 100, michealson audio tube integrated and my old faithfull krells ksa.

$review_text.: I've had this camera for three months and it has been an excellent camera as far as being lightweight, easy to use, excellent image quality, good battery life except out in the cold.  Keep it warm if you are going to be ourside on freezing days.I am active and I wear this on my belt every day, it doesn't seem any heavier than my cellphone, and it is easy to start up to capture shots that come my way without forewarning.  You could use this camera for bycycling, running, walking, hiking, snowsports, travel and just about anything except swimming, but if you are going to do portraits you will probably want a camera with more manual adjustments.  I wouldn't use it to shoot a wedding, although it would be great as a backup.  The ISO range from 100 to 3200 is really an asset.The video on it is easy to use and is of good quality but not HD.I have big hands, and some arthritis, so I use a very small lightweight tripod for a handle to keep the camera from shaking when shooting video or shots where I cannot brace my arms. The tripod is about six inches long and I screw it into the camera and it give me the extra control, plus if I want to set it up on a tripod I can. This is in addition to the vibration reduction that is on the camera.  The 2.7 inch screen works for me because I want the camera to be light.  I have a digital SLR for more demanding photography, and a HD Camcorder, so this camera fits a slot.

$review_text.: I am enrolled in a distance learning program where the lectures are on DVD, and purchased the Panasonic 8.5 inch DVD player to "carry my classroom with me".  I purchased this case for the DVD player and it is wonderful.  The DVD player has a very bulky external battery, I needed it for the long life, and this bag holds the player with the battery attached perfectly.  There a padded insert that creates additional storage for the adapters and headhphones next to the case.  The shoulder strap is VERY comfortable, others should learn from this one.  The front pockets, one for DVD storage, the other for...I use it to carry my Bible for reference when "attending class"....it will hold a small book or other accessories very well.  The DVD storage pocket will hold 15 or more DVD's easily.Overall, excellent value for the price paid.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent case, am very pleased with it.

$review_text.: Overall I liked this mount. It has a cool gripping mechanism for the phone (GPS), but this was also it's downfall. It's hard to explain, but see those arms that look like backwards capital "D"'s? Those slide apart (creating backward capital "C"'s) to accommodate and support longer devices. The way they slide is on small plastic rails. Well, somehow one of the thin plastic rails broke and I was unable to repair. Too thin and brittle? Did I bump in to it? I don't know. But now, I have a broken GPS/phone mount.The design is cool, useful and very adaptable but the longevity and durability is in question for me. One additional plus; it looks like they've updated the mounting bracket. The old one (mine) was a cumbersome 2 piece "hook here, screw there" type of design. Functional, adaptable to different sizes but a pain in the neck as well as having loose parts that are easy to misplace. The new design in the picture looks very user friendly as long as it's steady and sturdy.

"0101/1980 00:00"- WiFi unable to connect.  "Login Failed!" even thoughAndroid device shows a 100% strength connection tothe device.Well, stuff happens, right?Just fired off a "Contact Us" message at the BlackVueUSA site.So let's see what comes of it....  This rating could move upto 4 or 5 stars if the response is timely and helpful; otherwise...==================================================================EDIT 2013 07-19 10:49:Well, it's been four days and no response from BlackView support.I managed to get registered at the English-language forum of the Russian [...] and got some recommendations there.Re-flashed with the stock ROM, but no improvement; so I am going to try to invoke the 30-day Amazon warranty and send this thing back.Seems like a shame: the specs and apparent build quality on this device are sooooo enticing.But I would have to agree with others that the WiFi feature, as currently implemented, is more gimmick than real functionality.Because of the WiFi issue and the lack of response from BlackView support I will stick with a one-star rating.If you decide to give it a try, you may have better luck - certainly the preponderance of five and four-star reviews would suggest that.But buy it through Amazon.com so you have a fallback position.==================================================================EDIT 2013 08-02 1912:Well, I must have purchased it from the right Amazon supplier because the return went as smoothly as one could hope.  Amazon let me print out a UPS mailing label, I popped it back in the box, slapped on the label, and tracked down a UPS truck.  Receipt was acknowledged about a day later and the refund notice came soon afterwards.IMHO returns don't get much more painless than that.Five stars for the return process.

$REVIEW.: A nice combination of sound, style and durability.  For $200 I didn't expect an audiophile type headphone but when the sound exceeds your expectations that deserves an extra star.  The bass really booms.  The highs and mids are above average but don't expect Audio Technica or whatever audiophiles use.  I guess these would be compared to Beats Solos HDs but these SOL's got my vote.  And the number one factor would be durablity.But if your looking for a good durable pair of cans that you can commute on the train with (I live in NY) and not worry about snapping the headband or being rough with them this is your pair.  Whenever I wear my Beats or V-Moda's I feel like everyone is staring at them.  But these are more under the radar but with almost the same sound quality.  I like them because they are simple in design.The headband and earcups seem to be very tight (seal) on my head right now but I am hoping there is a breaking in period.  Don't get me wrong they are very comfortable but just a little tight that's all.Also I am not sure if the volume buttons are supposed to work with music but when I use my iPhone I can only use the pause button.  The volume buttons don't work.  Also the control talk sits kind of low on the wire.  If you wear a jacket or something you won't be able to reach it if you have it zipped up.They use a smaller jack then the standard 3.5 to plug into the speakers so you can't use any universal cords with these and you have to plug in both sides.  Doesn't bother me but it may for some.

$review_text.: After reading some of the reviews on this site I had some trepidation about buying this monitor

 However, when I got the monitor home it exceeded my expectations.I have recent experience with 3 other LCD monitors, a 19 inch Viewsonic (home), a 22 inch Acer (with pivoting stand) and a 19 inch HP (dual monitor setup at work)

 Prior to that I had used two 19's CRTs Ilyma (work) and Samsung (home).I am running the monitor at 1900 x 1200 with a VGA cable (my computer is 8 years old)
 The text is sharp and the colors are realistic


It seemed earlier LCDs need to burn in for the text to be sharp, however, this was sharp out of the box (unlike the HP above)


The back light is bright


I have no problem with viewing angles
 I shoot several thousand pictures a year and I have no problems with editing them
 Update 11-8-9: I connected it via DVI to a new computer and it looks even better.The touch on/off button works fine, I just drag my finger over the on/off spot

 I have not read the manual yet


I did not install anything from the CD
 I just pushed the menu button on the remote control and turned down the brightness, and turned off the chime of the monitor when it turns on or off.Basic cable digital channels are great

 The non-digitized channels are, of course, not so sharp - however they are just duplicates
 I don't watch much TV.The sound quality of the speakers is just OK

 If I watched TV I would try to figure out how to run the sound to my PC speakers.For a wish list, I would have liked RCA out sound, RCA video in(I had to buy new cables for my DVD (I know, old tech)),height adjustment on the stand.You can mount these on a wall mount but you need to buy a wall mount bracket seeWall Mount Bracket 24-25.5"currently $30ish
I haven't bought it, and don't intend to as I have a custom stand (AKA: home-made) that allows my DVD under the monitor.Finally, for home this works great


 I disposed of the old TV that was in the room

 Big enough for a bedroom TV.For work, a dual monitor setup where you can pivot one and leave one in landscape for spreadsheets is more useful...though there is nothing to prevent this from being used in a dual monitor setup.Additional Note:  August 8, 2010:  this monitor is still great, but a pain to wake up


 I have to toggle the source keys, and when I get to DVI I then push the enter key.

$REVIEW.: This bag has some pros and cons.pros:- lots of pockets/division of storage- very roomy considering the size, feels expandable- the TSA claims held true: I unzipped the laptop bag section  and laid it flat, and breezed right through security both there and back on a recent trip- the "memory buckle" is a pretty awesome idea. It allows to easily switch between extended and shortened strap modes, which is good depending on the situation you're in at the time. With the strap appropriately shortened, you can wear it across your back and rest assured that it will stay there, even while walking/running, which is very nice. The buckle also allows fast adjustments if needed- the separate zippered compartment for the laptop is an excellent addition, as it allows me to get the laptop in/out of the bag with ease, and without having to open the main flap, which I otherwise don't need to get into that often.cons:- the pockets are all layered on top of each other and obviously designed for thin objects. What this means is that unless you're packing lots of really thin items, such as skinny notebooks, you won't really be able to make use of all the pockets without causing the bag to bow out badly in the middle, and you'll never be able to use all the pockets to capacity. I was very disappointed by this, as I had high hopes about the divided storage.Summary:a nice, well made bag, however if you're looking for a go bag, I'm not sure this is going to be it, unless you get a couple of Grid-it's to put in the main compartment (which is pretty much what i've done). I will continue using it, as I like all the features, though I'm disappointed by the "flatness" of the storage pockets

The instructions were ok for getting the simple one going. I had real difficulty getting the Range Extender to work with the music bridge, though. I finally found that you have to give the second Music Bridge a different name and then initialize the range extender after the Music Bridge is located and plugged in.In the end, I can't use both bridges at the same time from the same computer, so I use one from one computer and one from another.I am an electronics engineer, and it took me several days to figure it all out.

$REVIEW.: I use this all the time. It comes with the wall charger that has 2 USB outlets, 1 cable with 2 power tips - one that fits most cell phones and another that fits most mp3 players and GPS units. It would have been better to have 2 separate cables as it is easy to lose the small tips. Another drawback is that when you plug this in, it hogs the both wall outlets. If you put it in the top outlet, it covers the bottom outlet. If you put it in the bottom and plug your USB cords in then the USB cords block the top outlet. So this would not be a good choice if you are low on outlets.I usually don't use the included cable anyway and I have plenty of outlets. I like to have a single charger that allows me to charge 2 devices at once. I have several devices that came with USB cables so I could charge from my PC, but it would have cost extra for a wall charger too. Now I don't need to worry about it anymore.

$review_text.: The GolfBuddy is a bulky watch/GPS rangefinder
Many golfers might not care that it isn't fancy and chic, but I'm sure there are a large percentage that will not like the hefty size of the watch and it's black, rubberized look


It isn't that it is ugly, just big and not very stylish

The other golfers I know in my area do care about appreances, and would likely rather use a smartphone app that does the same thing or better, and then wear a designer watch (if any)


It did have most of my local courses in it's database


The club recommender is a great feature and it is easy to read in bright sunlight
And it works as advertised with only a few lock-ups.An unasuming golf gadget lover might really like this product, but the constant need to recharge the watch after a day on the links may likely prevent most casual players from using the GolfBuddy as a regular timepiece
I would stay the GB-WT3 is ideally suited for a young golf student rather than your casual recreational golfer or pro

If you are okay with it's looks, learning-curve and limitations, you are getting a pretty good deal here for a very portable rangefinder


I wish the warranty were longer than 90 days though.~ Kort

$REVIEW.: Did the design team even test these out?  One has to wonder
 The Velcro is like the little velcro tabs you see on disposable diapers
 Seriously, Belkin, if you want to cut corners, the part that keeps the thing on your wrist is not the place to do it


I did give this strap a 3 because in all other aspects, this is a nice wrist strap for your Nano


It's pretty wide, so I can't see women wearing it outside of working out, but it is surprisingly comfortable
The band is stretchy, stylish, the Nano fits securely and it breathes nicely


To be fair, I did wear it around the house and it didn't fall off or come undone after an hour, but I'd have to wear it for a few days to get a better idea if Belkin is onto about its design
Also, if the Velcro teeth were too long, they would push through the lattice weave of the strap and itch like crazy.

$REVIEW.: To those folks who commented that the bass of the RE-400's was better than the bloated bass of many inexpensive headphones -- I would agree.  But the lack of bass and mid-bass 'cools' the presentation off to an unnatural extent.  Vocals are reproduced clearly, partly because content below that range is reduced.  Immersiveness and soundstage are also pooreer than other 'phones, including the $50 Soul SL49's, and the 'phones Sony includes with their 4xx series' Walkmans.  The MeElectronics 161'sMEElectronics A161P In-Ear Noise-Canceling Headphones with Balanced Armature Technologypriced in the $70-$90 range have a far superior sound to any of the headphones mentioned above.

$REVIEW.: After doing A LOT of research on MP3 players, I purchased this Sanza 2GB Fuze.  To give reference to my review, I do not plan to use the photo or video features on this player.  There are certainly other players with better screens for those particular kinds of things.  So, if you plan to use those features heavily, I would be looking more towards a IPod Touch or a Sony Walkman or mabe the Sanza View (I think it is called).  The screen on this is simply too small for it to be worth it.  As for the music features, this player matches just about any other brand out there.  I have tried this thing in various set ups - in my car, on a stereo, through computer speakers, and with the ear buds.  They all sound really quite nice with the exception of the horrible ear buds that come with the player.  But hey, they are ear buds and will sound bad anyway.  The radio thing is nice but not a deal maker or breaker IMO. In any case, it draws good clear signal.  My biggest complaint is the interface.  The menu set-up is not extremely intuitive and the controls take some getting used to.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but the wheel thing seems like a way to make something that should be easy more difficult.  When I am in a song menu, I can't tell you how many times I've tried to simply press down and nothing happens. In most menu's it forces you to use the wheel.  The other part about this is that it is not always consistent.  Some menus you press the middle button to select and others you press to the right.  Sometimes you can use up-down other times you can't.  Really kind of a mess in that regard.  Finally, there is an expandable memory slot but the manual itself does not really explain anything about this at all.  I put my SD card in and expected the player to prompt me about formatting it or something much like my cellphone did when I put one in it.  I scrolled through the menus and couldn't find a thing about it.  The manual they provide is also mum on this point.  I have not filled the player past internal capacity yet so I'm not worrying about it but it seems to me if you have a feature like this that sets you apart from your main competitor - IPOD - you would make a huge friggin deal about it in the owners manual.In, summary:Pros -1. Great MP3 player.  Nice sound.  Decent equalizer.2. Expandable memory.3. Radio.4. Radio and Sound recording.5. PRICE!!!6. Good Battery life (so far).Cons -1. Small screen.2. Moderately difficult and cumbersome menus and interface.3. Manual is not comprehensive.4.  No wall charger included.

$REVIEW.: I was renting this TV thru a rent-a-type place paying $140 a month before I purchased this thru amazon. Let me tell you this TV is the best deal since EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did order thru amazon paid $789 and when it arrived the screen was CRACKEd. I was so mad. I waited a week for this TV to arrive and it came broke. I called up amazon and the lady told me they would rush ship me another one. I asked how long should it take, and she said about a week. I told here what kind of rush shipping is that, as I waited a week for the first one to arrive. She then said she could do nothing. Could not even credit me something for this inconvenience. Horrible customer service on this AMAZON deal. If I knew it would take 2 weeks to arrive I would have gone to WOLLY WORLD!!!UPDATE (11/28/09): After my purchase with Amazon for this TV to only arrive with a cracked screen, I was weary of ordering thru them again, so on 10/24/09 I ordered thru "6th Ave Electronics".It took about another week (11/2/09) to get the TV from 6th Ave, and when it finally arrived (via UPS), it also had a CRACKED SCREEN!!! I called 6th Ave and they had me take pics of the screen and email it to there customer service. They then sent UPS back to come pick up the TV the next morning. UPS also had the return slip when they arrived. UPS was quick to pick TV up and leave.Now I called 6th Ave and asked what was going to be done about this, and they said since UPS failed, they would ship it another method. This time they used some semi-trucking company.It took about another week for the replacement TV to arrive, which to my surprise, came with a beautiful, marvelous, and intact SCREEN. great job 6th AVE!!!------- Now about the PANASONIC 50" PLASMA TV.... Looks nothing short of amazing. Beautiful, Glossy, Glorious...HINT: Once you get the TV, turn the screen display settings to VIVID, it looks INCREDIBLE!I dont know what people are talking about when they say this TV has slight Image Retention... I have see none whatsoever in the month that I have had it.PROS--Amazing display (can't tell difference between this and a 1080p TV)--Good Sounding speakers!--No Pixelation whatsoever (I have Time Warner and it upscales SD channels nicely, although most channels I watch are in HD)--3 HDMI's--Ability to Rename the INPUTS Onscreen... e.g. If a Nintendo Wii is hooked up to Video 2, you can rename Video 2 to "Wii"--Has hidden Anynet CEC abilities... e.g. when I change the volume on the Tv, it automatically changes the volume on my Samsung Blu-Ray home theater-in-a-box volume instead (I use Optical Audio Output)CONS--The remote feels VERY CHEAP.--Glossy screen can sometimes show reflectionsAll-in-all one of the best buys i have ever made in my lifetime... I love when my buddy comes over and says I have the TV every man dreams of having in his living room!!!

$review_text.: I've used silicone isolation headphone before, but none were so hard to keep them in the ear.  For this M9P headphone, I've tried all the supplied ear tips but none of them were able to keep the headphone in my ear.  When I push it in my ear, it'll just eject itself out.  I'll have use my breath to moisten the ear tip and put it in so it stick better to the ear canal. But if I move my head, talk or eat, it'll come loose.In term of the sound quality, I found it inferior to the apple kit headphone.  The base is strong, but the mid is muddy and the high isn't clear enough.The headset functionality was the reason I chose this pair of headphone from MEE, but because of the isolation feature, when you talk, your own voice gets very loud and it is just weird.  But maybe it's how it is for isolation headphone..

$review_text.: This remote will change the setup of your home entertainment experience into something enjoyable


First, let me tell you what I used to have to do to get a DVD on


First, I would turn on the TV and select input 7, then turn on the DVD player, then turn on my AIWA receiver that the speakers are hooked up to
Then I would turn the AIWA dial to Video 2 (since I long ago lost the remote), then finally start the movie
Now, I just need to select "watch a DVD" and all of the above is done instantly

It's really quite amazing!  The remote can be programmed for the same devices in multiple rooms as well to control TV's, DVD players, game systems, stereos, mini systems, boom boxes, cable boxes, home climate, and more.After you install the remote software on your computer, you have to gather all of your model #'s, then attach the remote to your computer via USB


After entering your model #'s the software guides you by asking questions regarding your setup


After all questions are answered the remote is updated to work on your system

Should there arise a problem, the remote has an onscreen guide that will ask you questions in order to fix the problem


My initial problem was that the remote was turning on AUX 2, not video 2, so it actually fixed itself after using the onscreen help guide.This remote has a rechargeable lithium ion battery, and has over 250,000 different devices available at the web site for programming


In the rare event that your device is not listed, this remote can also "learn" functions if you have the old remote.One feature I'm disappointed in is that the remote is not pageable
It would have been a nice feature to add that, especially in a house with little kids that like to hide cool remotes.The customer service department was helpful with the one setup issue I had

Of course, it was user error, but I didn't know how to set it up for 2 CD players in 2 rooms, so they walked me through the problem and I had the issue resolved in under 5 minutes.I highly recommend this remote for audiophiles and videophiles


I cannot imagine going back to 10 remotes.

$review_text.: I had to downgrade my rating to 1 star. NOT recommended at this time.I was pretty happy with the MX1000, especially the shape, which was more comfortable than any other mouse I've used. The Revolution is almost as comfortable and some will like that it is narrower between the thumb and the fingers and shallower under the fingertips. The MX1000 is taller towards the front so your fingers are higher off of the desk.The base has been extended under the thumb - great. Now I wish they would extend the base on the right side so my fingertips wouldn't drag on the mousepad -- I have the same complaint about all mice.The Rev is nice but I miss the up/down buttons that were on the MX100 just above and below the wheel -- I wish the Rev had those buttons. I realize the new scroll wheel is supposed to obviate the need for the up/down buttons, but so far I have my doubts.When you press down on the Rev wheel, you switch between free-spin scroll and click scroll. But this means you can't press the wheel as a SELECT button -- that's a darn shame. I'd rather have the SELECT function in the wheel and control the scroll mode with another button.So what I'd really like is an MX1000, but with a wing at the right side of the base under the fingers and a wheel like the one on the Rev. Even better, shape the mouse like the cup of a hand in a relaxed position.As far as accuracy goes, this mouse seems to have the same tracking engine as the MX1000, which reportedly works at 800 dpi and the laser works better on more surfaces than the MX700.Problems:The settings don't hold for some programs and you have to keep manually reseeting the wheel speed, acceleration and the click 1st spin 1st option.I have two of these and one is going back to the factory because of a  bad battery. A few have posted that the battery goes for one or two weeks or more without recharging; others have posted that the battery lasts only a day or two. Both of those things are true in my experience, depending on which of my two MX Revolutions you're talking about. Your mileage might be the same.With further work on the software, and better quality control on the batteries, which, btw, are not replacable batteries, this could be a good mouse. Different enough from the MX1000 that one can't say it's better or worse -- it depends on which shape you find long term more comfortable. For now, and at these prices, I definitely wouldn't recommend purchasing the Revolution.

First time i saw this on amazon I knew this would make an excellent linear guide for that system and sure enough it was exactly what i wanted and needed. It is easy to drill, I have tapped the ends with a hand held 3/8th-16 tap so you dont need any heavy machinery to alter or cut this rail. Yet it is strong enough to jump on.5/5 stars for any purpose you might be interested in.

$REVIEW.: I only rate items that are horrible or above and beyond wonderful as a typical rule. I have been using Western Digital external and network cloud devices for years. I have had an issue or two with things getting lost but not that big of a hassle when you back up now and then. The real issue I have run into is data transfer rates. My WD externals and network storage devices are always as slow as gum when transferring to and from. Also, I have been using the smaller devices. I have hesitated for years to upgrade to a real NAS device because of the horrible reviews WD as well as Seagate and others got on their products. I needed 16 or more TB and the reviews seemed to be half and half. When one half calls the device a paperweight though, I do not care to play the odds. Further, when reading reviews of the WD and Seagate NAS devices, even the favorable reviews, they still mentioned how slow the devices were.Thankfully, one of those reviews mentioned Synology saving them all of their hassles and more. I looked up this device. I saw the outstanding review ratio compared to the others I has been researching and decided to try it out. I got this four bay DS412+ and added four WD 4tb Red Drives to the order. Now the review begins.I am ordering another of these soon and maybe two. Out of the box, the drives just snap into place, no tools required for my purchase. I plugged it in, I turned it on, I loaded up the device in my browser and I set the settings for guests to read and myself to write. I then started dragging the contents of ALL of my other network storage and shared computer drives to folders on this device. Nine different groups of files all copied at once. Never had a file copy conflict or issue. Never had a hiccup or a moment of confusion. It is quiet, easy to use, works like a dream, and here is the best part. When I copy files from it to my other machines etc. it is FAST. I mean USB 3.0 and Gigabit Ethernet fast, like it should be. I did not know that the network storage could be this easy or fast. I now have no idea why WD and Seagate even bother, their equipment, even those I have that work fine, pale in comparison to this device on every level and some I had not thought of.

I forgot what the wood finish on my desk looked like as it had not seen daylight in months!  Despite having a good sized desk at home, I still manage to put more junk on it than I should

 So when I got this keyboard, I was at first scared that I would lose it under papers

 It is so small!  I have kinda thick hands, so I was worried that it would be painful to use this keyboard


 NOPE!  I am amazed how natural this keyboard feels

 The buttons give good resistance when punched

 And did I mention it was small?  I went from a ergonomic keyboard to the wired Apple aluminum keyboard when they first came out


 That cleared up a lot of room


 And this has given even more room (to place more unneeded junk)!  Seriously, my mouse pad is bigger than the keyboard

$REVIEW.: I bought a Zacuto Z-Finder 2.5x to take advantage of the tremendous video opportunities with the Canon 5DII
With or without glasses, you simply can not focus this camera in video mode without some sort of magnifying setup
The Z-Finder is a professional viewfinder that is head-and-shoulders better than imitators.First off, it works perfectly! Focusing is tack sharp and I can even shoot moving subjects
This is a high-quality optical viewfinder that covers the entire live view screen from side-to-side

The fit is tight and secure on the back of the camera

It takes a pretty good yank to remove the Z-Finder, plus it has a safety loop you can secure around your neck or the camera.The anti-fog disk over the rear eyepiece works great

I've used my Z-Finder in the humid, steamy air of Houston after a rainstorm, and it never has a hint of fog


Zacuto includes an extra anti-fog disk in case you ever damage the original.The tough machined aluminum Gorilla Plate (included) attaches to the camera's tripod socket, then the Z-Finder's mounting frame connects to the plate via an odd combination of thumb wheels and hex nuts
You can still connect the camera to a standard tripod with the Gorilla Plate attached

The Z-Finder is not difficult to attach, but take care to center the viewfinder perfectly


The thumb wheel/flange connection almost doesn't fit with the 5DII, but it is secure when tight

The mounting frame's flange should be 1/4 inch longer.One annoying design quirk is a big protruding knob on the rear of the Gorilla Plate
It makes it very difficult to reach the on/off switch on the Canon 5DII.I'm giving the Z-Finder 4 instead of 5 stars because of: 1

the high cost, 2


the mounting frame flange almost doesn't fit, 3


the annoying and ill-placed tightening knob.But at this time, there simply isn't any other pro-level viewfinder for DSLR video photography
If you are serious about DSLR video, don't hesitate!UPDATE: Don't know why I didn't think about this earlier


I used a hex wrench to remove that darn protruding red knob on the back of the Gorilla Plate
Now I can reach my camera's "on/off" switch! Gee, it only took a year to realize this.UPDATE 2: This week I shot stills and video all day long of a huge sculpture being moved across town


The Zacuto worked great

All the video is sharp and the Zacuto never showed any sign of slippage despite some pretty rough treatment.

No one will be using it as a daily unit, which is a good thing

Works for this purpose, but I wouldn't want it as a &#34;daily driver&#34;.P.S
Bought this specifically to get windows 7 for software compatibility reasons at a low price

You get what you pay for, sorta....

$REVIEW.: I know it is just a monitor, but when I pulled it out of the box, I couldn't believe it
 It is really stylish


 If I have to have a monitor to look at all day, I am happy it is so nice looking

 I had no trouble setting it up, which is great because I have had some nightmares in the past
 It is so much lighter than the ones I had been used to
 The screen is a bit brighter than my old Dell, which I am grateful for
 I have really had no problems or issues with it at all,.


$SUMMARY.: This thing is beautiful

$REVIEW.: This is the first Transcend memory card I have ever owned and I am very happy with it.I have aFujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black)in which I have been using aFujifilm 4 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Cardand aSanDisk 4GB Extreme HD Video SDHC Card Class 6 (Retail Package); these are the only two brands of Flash Memory Cards recommended by Fujifilm.Nonetheless, I decided to try this low-cost memory card and I can tell you that it works perfectly. Though the Fujifilm card is a Class 10 and the SanDisk is Class 6, I have never been able to observe any speed difference in them, either in writing images to the card or in transferring those images from the card to my computer. (Fujifilm recommends Class 4 or better for video with this camera; Class 2 is fine for still pictures.)ThisTranscend 8 GB High Speed Class 10 UHS Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC10U1Eworks no differently than those other two I own.So why buy this one? The price! Take a look at Amazon's price for this 8 GB card as opposed to the prices for those 4 GB ones.I have no means of actually measuring read/write speeds as some other people do. I can only comment on what I observe when I'm taking pictures or transferring them under similar conditions.This Transcend 8 GB card is just as fast as those two others and certainly fills the bill in my camera. Obviously it holds twice as many pictures as those 4 GB ones. Thus I can highly recommend it to you.Thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H. Bulk

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a set of over ear headphones to fall asleep to during the day to drown out the noise of my urban neighborhood. I'm a Bose fanatic so of course I tried them first. Bose had more open and spacious sounding highs but the bass was too light. I also tried Beats by Dr Dre, the studio and the pro. Then I tried every pair in Best Buy and in HH Gregg. The Sony's sound fantastic with the most bass of them all. The mids and highs are also excellent. I listen on my laptop and my iPhone4. For some types of bass heavy music a little equalization is needed because they put out a lot of deep bass which is great for my purpose. It actually helps me sleep. The only set I preferred over the Sony's (by a small margin) were the Beats Pro which were $399. I got my Sony's for $63. No brainer. I like the flat cord and the extreme comfort of the Sony's. The storage bag is a nice touch as well. They seem pretty durable so far, as they have not broken while I've slept in them. No comment on using them on-the-go because I haven't. I prefer in-ear buds for travel.*************************************************************UPDATE************************************************************Almost a year later and they are still working perfectly. No speaker problems, wiring frays, or defects. When I got them I was listening to them on a laptop, an iPhone and an iPad with little equalization capabilities. I now mostly use a Galaxy S3 with the Poweramp app and OMG! Equalization with these will put a huge smile on your face guaranteed. Still five stars. Everyone I let listen to them loves them. I have been using them on the go as well as at home and they are superb. There is only one problem. The large ear cushions are extremely comfortable, but in warm weather they can have your head around your ears sweating. Nothing else negative about them.

$review_text.: Perfect for summer, I found the Slim Cover to be stylish and fun! My previous Kindle cover was black, so I discovered this color is much more exciting. When sitting by the beach or a pool for the summer, I think I'd prefer something fun and stylish. The sturdy stand allows me to read hands-free and because I can spend hours with a book in my hands, this is an added bonus. The only drawback to this slim cover is the use of elastic to hold the four corners of my Kindle device. The elastic seems to stretch and move as I read, and my concern is that eventually the elastic would slip off just like a bandaid! I like the style and fun colors, I like the hands-free stand, and I'm unsure if I like the elastic...over time and continued use I'm certain I'll have my answer to that. I'm curious to see what you think of it, so post your comment too!!

$review_text.: I had considered the switch from HDD to SSD quite a few times in the past. The faster speed, the relative ease of application, and the promise of never having to worry over hard drive failures due to over heating were all big sellers, but I'm old school and the switch was (still) a hard sell. Hearing enough of SSDs failing shortly after purchase and the concept of limited rewrites, along with not wanting to actually transfer all my data (and re-install all my applications), I was pretty reluctant to use this SSD at first.Let me say this ahead of time: those worries were absolutely foolish and if you have the chance to get an SSD get one IMMEDIATELY!Transferring and reinstalling just about everything was still a pain but the faster speed, especially for those using newer editions of Photoshop or playing graphics heavy games, makes it so much worth it in the end. I wish I would've switched to an SSD years ago!

$REVIEW.: I was provided this product by Sharkk to test and provide a fair and honest review.When I first got this product, I thought it was going to be horrible. There is hardly a good portable speaker for 13$ out there. With that in mind I was very surprised when I pulled out my iPhone and connected it and started playing a song. It has a very wide range of audio quality and nice bass for the size of the speaker. For the size the sound is amazing, if you want better sound might as well lung around a bigger speaker. Even one of my friends that was sitting by me when I first tired it was very surprised, because he did not think it would work well. He likes heavy bass and thought that this speaker was great! If you want something that fits it your palm, I highly recommend this!The cord neatly wraps under the speaker. I have not had any problems with the cord coming out of the holder. The speaker collapses  and cuts the height in half when it is time to store it. It would easily fit into any pocket to take anywhere. There are four buttons on each of the &#34;legs&#34; that control the volume and power. I did not notice them until I pressed one accidentally and it clicked. As for the battery it has last 4 hours so far on a charge. I have not used it long enough to find out how long it lasts. Although 4 hours is a long time seeing how small the speaker is.If you are looking for a small portable speaker that has great sound for the size this one is for you and not to mention that it is very reasonable.Pros:-Small and portable-The Price-The sound it hasCons:None

$review_text.: As a longtime general 'gadget geek', Ham Radio enthusiast, and obsessed high-end audiophile, I have high standards when it comes to my electronics and music.  I am always naturally curious about new audio products, and get really excited when I come across a true bargain.  This SimplyVibe V3-5BPS multi-function speaker qualifies as such!  It has an auxiliary input jack, stereo headphone out jack, MicroSD card slot, FM receiver, and it comes with a long lasting rechargeable lithium-ion battery.  From the colorful, well made custom box, to the hefty feel and nice fit-and-finish of this speaker, it absolutely reeks of quality.  I needed a compact, very portable FM receiver with a nice sounding built-in speaker, and long lasting rechargeable battery that I can take with me everywhere around the house, garage, and backyard.  Not only can this speaker receive FM stations well (especially if you're in or near a major metro area), it's sound is truly AMAZING!  I cannot believe the full-bodied, dynamic, detailed sound coming out of this tiny speaker!  Even the bass is solid!  The full-bodied sonics this wondrous little speaker is capable of belies it's small size!  The only minor downside, is the near incomprehensible manual written in 'Chinglish'.  But fortunately, it is easy to figure out and use, especially by watching the many product review videos of it here on Amazon, and on 'YouTube'.  I can't help but thinking how even more awesome a dual speaker, true stereo version of this unit would sound, if SimplyVibe ever came out with one.  One with an FM frequency readout, and a stereo indicator light.  But I digress...
$review_summary.: WOW!  VERY impressive full-bodied sound!  This is exactly what I needed!

$REVIEW.: This 8.9" Tab is basically the 10.1", only a little smaller with all of its good and some not so good features. I am not going to go into 'specs' because they are available at Amazon and at Samsung's own site (yes, there's Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi and so forth) but I will discuss my week-long experience of using it.I am not sure if 8.9" is the sweet spot in tablets but it's good that, unlike a certain rival, Samsung is moving away form the 'one size must fit all' philosophy. I am personally okay with 10.1" but the slightly smaller size may appeal to those who do a lot of on-screen thumb-typing. Also, since the resolution is the same 1280x800 you get a higher pixel density that improves on the 10.1" impressive display.POSITIVES- Lighter - Smaller means a couple of ounces lighter. A possible advantage if you're using the Tab as a reader.- Super-responsive to touch, possibly even more so than the 10.1" Tab.- Flash 10.2 is not only supported but it comes pre-installed - one thing not to worry about.- Samsung adds its own mini apps tray. In the end you pick your favorites from the market but some choice is always a positive.- Size, of course. Anyone who gets the 8.9" picks it for its size so, again, choice.- Great forward and rear facing cameras, same as the 10.1"- Dual-core processor handles Honeycomb with ease and, hopefully, makes it a good candidate for a future ICS upgrade.- You can have the Android market and the Amazon Appstore installed.NEGATIVES- Memory can't be expanded due to lack of a microSD port (but 32GB should be sufficient)- No HDMI port either- Backside could be a little thickerRATINGI had the opportunity to use the 8.9" Tab for one week, swapping our recently-upgraded ICS (Android 4) XOOM, mainly because a friend was eager to experience the 'new' Android. In the end, we were both favorably impressed with the other's tablet and agreed that we could live happily with either.While I understand that the some could miss an HDMI and an SD slot the reality is that my XOOM has them and the only time I actually used them was while testing my tablet. I did not miss them on the Tab during the week I had it for myself. I prefer the 10.1" format myself but I must admit that the crisper display was quite attractive.In the end, the 'negatives' are not such a big deal. I can say that I loved playing with the smaller Tab for a few days.

$REVIEW.: There are a whole bunch of MP3/CD players on the market today. You can probably find one for $.... However this one is really worth the extra money.You can customize nearly every feature imaginable on the device. It supports multiple languages and it also has an FM radio.The battery life is supurb. I normally get around 6-10 hours on a full charge (depending on how loud I'm playing it on my headphones) and if you plug it the extra battery kit you can probably hit a 20 hour battery life (the website says 24 hours).This thing is also quite stylish and after a small learning curve very comfortable to use. I personally wouldn't reccomend upgrading to the 400. It seems the only difference is a slightly (and I mean slightly) smaller design. If you can get the 350 at under $...I would go for it.

$review_text.: At first, I thought these earbuds sounded great after the 120 hour burn in

I used them for about 6 months and they are still working fine
Then I started looking into cheap IEM's on head-fi and found a thread filled with them

This is where I heard about the JVC HA-FX40 earbuds, and decided to buy a pair for around a total of $25


After a long burn in and using these for awhile, I can honestly say the JVC's blow these Klipschs to shreds in terms of sound and build quality

With the JVCs, the highs and mids are much more clear and rich compared to these Klipsch's
The bass with the JVCs are much more accurate and puchy compared to the almost obsolete and inaccurate bass of these Klipschs
Not much needs to be said about the build quality since most people know about the horrid build quality of the Image s4.Basically, stay away from these if you are looking for a good sound and build quality

I HIGHLY suggest picking up a pair of JVC HA-FX40s, which can be found here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079LE43W/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00

$review_text.: The picture is a little dark, and most of the tilt capacity is for tilting up.  My TV stand was above eye level, so now when I sit on my sofa with the TV tilted as far down as possible, the picture is still not quite right.  I don't see why they couldn't make slight modifications to the stand to improve the downward tilt ability.Aside from that mechanical problem, the picture quality is mediocre.  Darker scenes look particularly poor on it, no matter what settings I adjust.
$review_summary.: OK for the price. Tilt ability is poor

$review_text.: Nearly every battery powered device these days is charged by one of those ubiquitous wall warts.  You've seen them - you probably have at least a half dozen already - big rectangular boxes each containing a transformer to convert the 120 volts AC from the wall to DC to charge or power your devices.That's OK if you have one charging a phone, laptop, media player or portable game station at every night stand or desk in your house, but what if you're out of town and would like to charge everything from one or two outlets in a hotel or guest bedroom?Forget those multi-outlet power strips.  They may have eight outlets, but sometimes they will handle, at most, three wall warts.Enter the Accell D080B-007K-R PowerSquid Outlet Multiplier.  This device splits a single outlet into five individual outlets wired far enough apart to handle five chargers with ease.  Great for trips, where you may also be charging razors, GPS units, cameras, camcorders and other devices while on the road..

$review_text.: I have played every format from DVD+RW to DVD-R and each one works perfect.  You can play a DVD full of divx material and it looks and sounds great.Better yet is that DVDs I made from content taken from a Tivo play just great.  Even though my Sony DVP-NS725P could play my Tivo DVDs, the picture was jumpy and flickered between scene changes - very annoying.  But with those same DVDs, this Philips plays them just fine.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera from Best Buy before seeing the one star reviews for it

Usually I ignore those, but everyone seemed to be having the same problem with the battery on video mode, I figured I might want to pay close attention to how the camera behaved


I wanted to try the camera out for a whole day and see if it gave me the same issues that others were getting
I used it pretty heavily for almost an entire day and was almost convinced it wasn't one of the defective ones


I've owned a lot of Canon cameras in the past and all of them have incredible battery life, so I figured one day of heavy use should kill the entire battery

By the end of the day it was still showing a full charge


That is until I turned it to video mode and the battery was then completely drained
Based on the other reviews, I'm not going to take my chances and see if the problem goes away or gets worse


I'm returning the camera today and will probably go with another brand.

$review_text.: We've had this new Onkyo receiver for a week now, connected to our 5.1 Bose Acoustimass 10 system and it works wonderfully.  The HDMI upconversion has made life so much simpler for us and allows us to use a single HDMI connection between the receiver and our HDTV for all our system components.  The lack of audio up/down-conversion has not been an issue for us (but I suppose could be if we were trying to 'tape' a digital audio source on an analog recorder).  We're looking forward to getting the new Onkyo DS-A2X ipod dock whose release has been delayed probably until at least August 2007 (was originally supposed to be released in early July) as the new dock promises full ipod video and photo display passthru.  The value for the buck of this receiver is fantastic.  My only small gripe is that, for such a full-featured receiver, they don't have a way to jump to a preset radio tuner station.  It seems like a silly oversight, given that they allow up to 40 stations to be preset, yet the only way to get to the presets is to scroll through consecutively from one preset station to the next, rather than ie. have a Preset-station selection button and punching in the number of the station preset.  The only way to go 'directly' to a preset station is to manually punch in the station's frequency, but that defeats the whole purpose of having a preset.  I may be able to get around this issue next month when Logitech releases the updated firmware for their Harmony remotes which will allow for macro/sequential-command programming to a single remote button, allowing me to transmit each radio station's frequency with the press of a single button on the remote.
$SUMMARY.: Great little receiver - minor issue with the tuner

$review_text.: I tried to cancel my order because it says that this does not work with the Macbook Pro Retina's.  I was too late but, it does work with mine.  I find that USB 3.0 is a bit finicky in general whether you're on a PC or a Mac.  I do have to unplug it sometimes when booting up my Mac.  Also daisy chaining them gives me mixed results.  Attaching two USB hard drives causes me some issues on occasion but its not consistent.  I don't think its the USpeed unit as I'm seeing same results with an iogear unit I have.  Once I figured out the best "setup", it works fine.USB 3.0 is so fast and readily available for Mac and PC's.  The USpeed Superspeed hub does have some build quality issues.  The USB ports feel as though you have to be gentle with them.  I just have a feeling that it will eventually break.  The iogear hub I have doesn't feel cheap but also didn't work as well as this did.  Because of that, I gave it 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: Usually I have to buy 3-4 cases before I find the right one, but this is perfect right out of the gate. The soft &#34;fingers&#34; grip the Nexus firmly and allow for multiple angle setup without losing their hold on the device. The inside is soft padded material while the outside is a thick grain faux leather. Holes for plugs and buttons are well placed, and the &#34;auto&#34; off magnets are correctly positioned to shutdown the device when the case is closed. This is a good case for office use and minimal protection. For hard use, I would go with the new Otterbox case (which is sturdy but a tad awkward to operate). I've used this case for over two months with no complaints. For the price, it was a good investment. If there are new developments over the next few months, I will post an update.

$review_text.: I have owned the Yamaha NS-555 speakers for about six months...Their performance is astonishing given the inexpensive price!My previous system consisted of a pair of Dynaudio Contour 1.3 SE monitors ($3500.00), a Krell KAV-300r receiver ($3500.00), and an Arcam CD 37 CD player.  That system was absolutely phenomenal, but it was supposed to be, that was expected.  I decided to downgrade and pocket some cash to help finance my master's degree and sold the whole system off.  After some serious research I bought a used Yamaha AX-592 2 ch. integrated amplifier for $75.00 (mint), a Yamaha DVD-S2700 (list $1000.00) for $180.00 off ebay, and the Yamaha NS-555 tower speakers.  I was expecting disappointment, instead I received a pleasant surprise!  This inexpensive system is fantastic sounding!  This system proves the axiom of diminishing returns...You would have to spend $3000.00+ to equal this current system.  The sound as a whole is very clean with taut deep bass and clean, clear mids and highs.  My audiophile friends cannot believe the sound quality/price ratio!  At the price of the NS-555s I expected nasally voices, harsh highs, and sloppy, bloated bass.  Instead I found beautiful clean voicing, smooth treble and fantastic bass pitch and definition!  The NS-555s are not comparable to my former Dynaudios but they were never meant to be.  Yet, they compare very favorably to speakers costing 2 to 3 times as much.The NS-555s are only moderately efficient at 89dB 1w/m so they require a relatively powerful/high current amplifier to extract their potential.  They have a nominal impedance of 6 ohms and considering that loudspeakers generally vary to between 2 ohms to 16 ohms impedance, a stable, strong amp is highly recommended!  My Yamaha AX-592 outputs 140 wpc into 8 ohms, 220 wpc into 4 ohms and nearly 480 wpc into 2 ohms.  You would need one monster home theater receiver to approach these numbers and none that I know of can truly do it with 5 or more channels driven.  I will say it again give them power and they will sing!The very fine build quality of the NS-555s belies their price.  The cabinetry is solid but not over-the-top.  The cabinet is lined with padding, the crossover is very well put together with quality parts, the drivers are of nice quality and the finish is very nice, they look rather expensive.  I have received numerous compliments on their beauty.I most highly recommend the Yamaha NS-555 speakers to any aspiring audiophile.  These speakers are great for music and movies and I cannot imagine a better bang for-the-buck!  They have excelled at all generes of music from Miles Davis to Metallica.  Yamaha has found a way to bring high-end sound to the masses, all of my equipment is very well put together, looks very good and sounds fantastic!Excuse me, I am going to sit down and listen to some music on these fine speakers!!!

$review_text.: I've recently replaced my Linksys 802.11B router with this G-version and had no issues at all with the switch.  Plugged in, installed new software / drivers and I was ready to go in a matter of minutes.  The new version of the router has easy-to-use access to built-in firewalls and other tools to limit wireless access.  I'm using this with an updated PCMCIA card (also Linksys) without any issues - very fast, much faster than the old 802.11b.  I can actually use for online gaming without any significant degradation vs. being plugged directly in.  All in all, a solid product which I'd recommend if you're looking for a wireless router.

$REVIEW.: Battery on the two Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb(s) that I have used have been horrendous. I say two because the first unit I was sold at the Apple Store in downtown Philadelphia was replaced by another unit- that had exactly the same battery issues. Battery issues are these. The first day you have the Ipod Touch 4g 64gb it seemed fine. But I bought it while I was at work (on a break) and got it turned on there at the Apple Store. So it just gets turned on and ends up in my pocket as i go back to work. Next day- it has my apps on it and songs and a few videos and ebooks. But it doesn't hold the all night charge all day. Just a few hours and by day two- it has me stressing that it is going to have power at the end of my day. I don't mean from a day of use either- I mean a day in my pocket. I'm a security guard- so the Ipod Touch 4g 64 is OFF- while in my pocket all day. The only time I take it out of my pocket (and ON)is during the two breaks that I have during the day and my lunch. So during my workday- I get almost exactly 1 hours actual use from my brand new Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb- where it is actually ON- and the rest of my day it is OFF in my pocket! But at the end of my day- it won't even turn on because it is out of POWER.You shouldn't have to pay the $430.00 cash that I paid to be stressed out worrying if your BRAND NEW IPOD TOUCH 4g 64gb is going to work.I have an appointment with the Apple Store this coming Tuesday- they will blah blah blah me- and try and foist a third IPOD TOUCH 4G 64gb on me I bet- but I'm getting my money back.It is a shame, though. It is truly amazing when it works- the most advanced and wonderful piece of electronics that I have ever owned- but I didn't ask to be a beta tester. When I paid my $430.00 dollars I thought they should have worked out the kinks- and expected just the awesome- Apple robbed me of my wonderful first APPLE Purchase. And have left me leery of buying any of their products ever again.My Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb - the one I originally bought and the replacement for it-both sucked battery-wise).Wait to buy this product- it's not ready for primetime.I purchased the iPod Touch 4g 64gb for 399.00 plus 31.92 tax total of 430.92Your telling me that the normal way of charging the thing isnt- the USB that Apple GAVE ME? (that charges 100%)but that I should purchase "some other gadget" for more money? when the way apple sold it to me doesn't work?UMMM No!I'm a (or I was) first time Apple product user with this product.Did I mention it was a replacement cuz the first one was a mess, too?I need to be the one??? to figure out how to keep their brand new gadget running? Me the one to jump thru hoops and such? Do this try that blah blah blah??No- my friend.I'm Not the 430 dollar "paying" beta tester.I returned the replacement- and got a chit for 430 dollars and their solemn promise to send me a check at some time in the future.Bear in mind I paid them cash money- greenbacks/ USA currency.I didn't want a check- I wanted what I GAVE THEM CASH!!!!!It's 4 days later i have no iPod touch 4g 64gb and no money either.Who knew they were such a scumbag company.I'll "probably" get my money back soon? (7-10 business days to cut me a check then mailing it nuther what 3 days?- I paid them lames CASH!!!!!)Dude avoid this company.They left me with my mouth open....... wow who knew mighty Apple was this lame?Apple is a bitter barrel of laughs and Apple sold me a lemon...iLameiUnbelievableiDontbelieveiTiWhoknew?

$REVIEW.: I unpacked and set up my TRENDNet TEG-S16G Ethernet switch and expected "just works," as you do with all switches these days.It "just worked" for about an hour
Streaming throughput slowly dropped to near zero.The RoKu I had plugged into one port kept losing the LAN connection


 When resetting it complained that there was no ethernet connection.Other computers that had to pass through the TEG-S16D to get to the outside world also had dead slow crawling throughput.I power cycled, switched cables, swapped ports - the usual.After wasting an hour troubleshooting, I backed up and replaced the TRENDNet with two smaller switches and all was fine again.For background, I've been a professional network administrator and systems architect for over 25 years


 When I started we barely had Ethernet and there were no Ethernet switches.Pass on the TRENDNet switch


 I recommend D-Link, Cisco, or SMC.

$REVIEW.: For everyone out there worried about buying expensive OFC wire, I'm going to share a bit of real world knowledge.  Electrons do not travel "through" a wire, but rather on the surface of each individual strand.  Save yourself some money by buying a copper clad aluminum.  Same wonderful copper conductive surface, however, you will save weight (aluminum is a lot lighter), save money, and still have speaker wire that performs.That said, Mediabridge is a brand I've been coming to as an electronics installer and DJ, for everything from interconnects to 12 gauge wire to run PA speakers, and anything they provide inbetween.  I haven't ever had a problem with any of their products, they're fantastic quality and deliver every time.The wire here is a true 16 gauge, which is nice, the CCA conductors are lightweight, the insulation is supple but protective.  This speaker wire would be perfect for automotive and short run household systems (surround sound system in a room, e.g.) I'm pleased with the sound quality, there isn't detectable noise or distortion, even at high volumes.  If you're looking to be budget conscious about your stereo install but don't want to sacrifice quality, I recommend this wire to everyone.

$REVIEW.: Kingston obviously has a longlasting name in computer memory

 This hard drive is great for my OS and other performance based programs

 Boots system very quickly(seconds) and pulls and opens files ridiculously fast.3/8/2014Well, the drive failed


 Around December I noticed my boot time about tripled and start-up was running slow


 My antivirus and start-up programs were taking a couple minutes to load
 About 1/3 of the drive completely failed on March 6th and drive wiped data


 Just over 6 months after installing the drive


 It seems to be pretty typical, the web is plastered with this drive having many problems
 Until Kingston reverts back to Toshiba-quality NAND I can't recommend this drive

 I will say this, Kingston's customer support was amazing


 They took my claim and approved my RMA in about 5 minutes
 Unfortunately, shipping cost is on the customer to get the product returned


 I won't be using this drive for anything critical again, and whatever you do use this drive for make sure you back up weekly


 Will probably go with a much higher end drive for my OS instead now
 Good SSD luck out there!

$review_text.: I thought this was going to be a fun little camera to have; living in the Pacific Northwest, a waterproof camera is a great thing to have - it rains a lot here!  :-)  But the complicated menus made me give up on this camera after just a few days - I am not one easily intimidated by electronics, but this one I found little patience for.I loved the green look (NOT because I am into the politically correct "green" movement - it was just a pleasant color) and the heavy feel of the camera; it felt sturdy and it took pretty pictures and recorded clear videos.  But having to go through several steps to change even the simplest setting was something I decided I did not want to do.  I missed having more outside knobs and dials to use, which, of course, a waterproof camera wants to have fewer of; I thus decided I did not need a waterproof camera.I also thought the lens was in a rather awkward place in the top left corner.  I found myself having to move my left hand down, and thus found the camera somewhat uncomfortable to use.The editing software installed on the camera seemed good.  The flash, however, used in my medium sized living room in the evening, was too bright.  Taking pictures in that same room without a flash worked great, though, so no real need for the flash when the room was well lit by my lamps.Something else that bothered me was the lack of catching movement and "freezing" it - my two older cameras can do that without any problems - this one could not.  Perhaps there was a setting I did not find that could have corrected this?  I tried to find out, but could not in the time I familiarized myself with this camera.However, for somebody who wants a waterproof camera, it will be a great pick; the pictures and video's were great, but I returned it anyway.  Based on the short time I had it, I would, however, recommend it for somebody looking for a waterproof and somewhat funky looking camera.  It just wasn't for me.

$review_text.: I bought this item and we took it to New Orleans a week later. We had a great time! I never got lost, it took us to restaurants, and locations all over New Orleans, including the Zoo. It was easy to program, easy to use. The only drawback was aquiring satellites in downtown, between tall buildings. It took us through the french quarter right to our parking garage, across the river to the west side, and home to Georgia via a route I've never tried before, from Columbus to Macon to Athens. I love it.

$REVIEW.: I just can't see any reason to pay the full retail price of the OEM Canon batteries for my Canon 7D.  Two years ago I bought the Opteka replacement batteries and they worked fine. At almost exactly two years.. they quit taking a charge. I only switched to the Wasabi because the overall comments were a lot better and more people rated this one higher. The batteries arrived partially charged and I placed them in the charger to bring them up to 100%.  I was able to use the Wasabi charger as well as the OEM Canon charger. On completion, they went into the camera and registered on the readout. I would have given 5 stars but I noticed the casings seemed a little thin and cheap. It may not matter since I don't know what under the casings, but perception wise, its not a good feature. I date my batteries so we'll see how long they last.  I'll add to my post at the end of their life cycle.
$SUMMARY.: So far so good.

$REVIEW.: I haven't found a way yet to pack in two camera bodies, 4 lenses and accessories. Its a nice bag, just not large enough. Especially if you have a full frame body (Canon 6D) and a couple of L lenses (even though the largest is just the 24-105 F/4L). Storing the lens hoods is very problematicIn addition - the height of the bad is not high enough to safely store your flash units (Canon Speedlite 600EX-RT) in a vertical position.Its a good quality bag - just not big as advertised by Canon. I'm rather disappointed with my purchase.This is one of those purchases that doesn't work well in doing remotely. Your better off going brick and morter store. This is not a fault of Amazon, but that of Canon.********** Update ****************I've given it a few months ...I take day trips often for photo opportunities, hell sometimes for days or a week. I have yet to find a practical way to use this bag. Its awkward in every way!So it just sits home - I never use it - still in brand new condition if someone wants to purchase!

$REVIEW.: After reading the reviews, this case was pretty much what I expected. There is no padding, so it does not really afford any protection for your PS3. If you want a convenient way to transport the PS3, this is fine, but if you need protection, you will need something else.PROS:Compact, lightweight design.Low price.CONS:NO padding.Only one interior pouch fits a controller.No room for games.As depicted in the product photos, there is ONE interior pouch that fits a controller (the other pouch is shown holding cables). This is accurate - the two pouches are DIFFERENT sizes, and it is difficult to squeeze the second controller into the "cable pouch" if you try, which is what I did. With two controllers in the lower pouches and cables in the upper netted pouches, the case was full, and I took my games separately.I used this case as a carry-on during a couple of flights. I also packed it inside a suitcase for other flights, but only after stuffing a couple of t-shirts inside the case to cushion the PS3.So, overall, you get what you pay for. The case suits my purposes - just don't expect heavy duty protection for a light-duty price!

$review_text.: Screen protector cuts glare and figure prints in half. They claim no sticky residue if removed in not quite true. They put the stickum on the outer black area of the screen which makes it secure, but even though you won't have residue to clean on the view screen, you will on the outer black area. No big deal for now as I don't plan to remove it until it wears out and I have to replace it. Otherwise it feels smooth to touch and slide and touch screen responds the same and doesn't blur the display. If it lasts more then 6 months, for just $8, I will recommend it and give it 5 stars if it lasts a year or more.

$review_text.: I decided not to use the HP backup software program included with the drive, but copied just about everything that I have dl'd in the past 5 years, plus the MY DOCUMENTS folders from my old Win2K and XP (using Win7 and Vista now)computers as well as countless, MP3s, JPEGs, BMPs, PDFs that were on DVDs.  Everything has been placed on this drive, and there is still room to spare.  The unit itself is smaller than a good pair of PC loudspeakers - the unit is really small.  It goes into power save mode automatically with your PC when it sleeps - BTW there is no power button on the drive), and it boots up along with your PC when powered on.  While I do wish the drive did have a power switch, I really can't say that I miss it.  The drive is exceptionally quiet, and I have to check the power light to make sure it is in operation.  The price for this unit is almost unbelievable, and makes it a smart decision for anyone looking to archive files and information.  I plan to purchase another one shortly.
$SUMMARY.: 2TB Ext Drive for under $200?

$review_text.: The first thing you need to know about these guys is that they are big. You're gonna feel like Joe 'numnuts' McNally hauling these things around. Completely closed and compressed (against the springs) they are 39" long. The reason they are so big is because they have only three sections, whereas many light stands have four. But since they have only three, all three can be beefy. Even at max height, these stands feel pretty stable.The max height at max stability (legs as wide as possible) is 8'6". It isn't hard to take these guys to the stated 9' height, but the legs are a little bit narrower than max stability. If you want to go crazy, you can even get these to stand at 9' 6", but the slightest breeze or bump of a subject will probably send it crashing down.The build construction is very nice;  the only plastic is the leg knob. I've only just taken mine out for a test run, so I can't speak to the long term durability, but I expect it to be pretty solid.The bag is a nice addition, but the zippers feel a bit flimsy. It will accommodate stands (when closed) up to 43" long.  The bag comfortably holds these two stands with _a_little_room_ to spare. Contrary to what another reviewer stated, there is no way to get two more light stands in this bag. I couldn't even fit one small 7' light-weight stand in with these two. A monopod? Probably. Three sections of aluminum cross bar? Sure. Another light stand? I doubt it. Two more light stands? No way.Considering the price, I'm very pleased with this purchase. These guys are going to get a workout in my kit.Update December 2013: these stands have come out for many shoots, and I can honestly say I have 0 complaints. They work. They are solid, and have required no adjustments. Even the bag has held up just fine, showing little, if any, signs of usage.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent light/background stand

$review_text.: When first came out, it was way too much money for me.  As good as the 20/1.7 is at $350-400 this was not worth double that.  But as the price drops it makes more sense.  It is a better lens than the 20/1.7, but only slightly so with some pros and cons.vs 20mm:pros -high quality glass and build qualityfaster focus.  the 20mm's only weakness is slow focus (at times)slightly faster at 1.4consdouble size and weight

$review_text.: First of all, I bought this camera to shoot in low light situations and I tell ya, it delivers! I have a Canon EOS 60D and I hate lugging it around with me when taking indoor or low light shoots. I have been looking for a P&S; camera with excellent lowlight images and this happens to be the best one. I have not used the movie mode or other shooting modes. My main concern is only the low light shooting. I also bought the Panasonic DMZ-ZR3 due to its glowing review including its low light shooting capabilities but it did not deliver. It had very poor IQ under low light shooting.. very poor.This is the P&S; I have been looking for. EXCELLENT CAMERA! Note: I don't care about the zoom (5x). What I care about is the Image Quality.UPDATE - 1/13/11 - I went to Disneyland on New Year's Eve and took a video of the Parade. The video quality is excellent! It is as good as a high end camcorder.. it is simply amazing in 1080p or even 720p. The only draw back is the battery life. I brought an extra battery to make sure.. and I am glad I did. I highly recommend this camera!

This universal cup holder worked perfect for me, when you twist and lock in the base it's very sturdy.  I removed the rubber cup holder insert that came with the truck to make it more secure with less wobble. If you should order the suction mount always make sure the cup holder mount is larger than the suction base.  Example:  3.5&#34; mount to a 3.25&#34; suction base.

I was very impressed with the ease of use and quality of the images

The 3D view finder needs to be seen to believed
Everyone that was shown this camera is blown away by it


Have only played with it for a few days.

looking forward to taking some outdoor shots
The 2D image is really no better or worse than any other taken with a camera of this type.

you're essentially getting two average cameras combined into one to achieve a 3D effect with an amazing viewfinder.

Want a high end quality COMPACT 2D CAMERA?.

Consider a LEICA BRAND


This Fuji camera also shoots hi def video


the unit has an HDMI output so you can hook it up directly to a 3D TV, put on your 3D glasses and impress all your friends
Impressive little camera and lots of fun


YouTube has some tutorials posted about this item
Pay no more than $399.00

I was careful with the little plastic lens cap but still lost it in the end.  Pretty poor design I think, but not enough to detract from the overall product.

$review_text.: Lets start this review by stating the obvious, this is not a 500mm prime lens costing about 10K, this is a decent lens with great range for under 1K.  It is silly to start comparing this lens to others that cost 6 to 10 times as much money.I am using this lens on a Nikon D7000.  I have read other reviews about the slow focus speed but I am not seeing that on my camera body.  It focuses fast and adjusts rapidly using the continous mode.  Focus speeds have as much to do with the camera body you are using as it does the lens itself.  This lens does not have the internal focus motor so it will not work on cameras that do not support this such as the D5000.The pictures I have got are very sharp up to about 400mm.  The image quality suffers a little from there to 500mm.  It is something I can live with and the images are still usable but get a little soft.  Up to 400mm this lens is very sharp.  For wildlife this lens works great and you can get shots you would have otherwise missed because of the reach.It is a fairly slow lens but I have found that it does not get into the 6.3 range until you pass the 400mm mark.  I bump my ISO to 800 or so and have no problem getting crisp images handheld.  I normally shoot on a monopod because I am shooting wildlife and mostly in the wait and shoot mode and this lens gets heavy.With the hood on and zoomed to 500mm this lens is long, very long.  With the hood off and the zoom returned it is a short lens.  One of the things I do not care for is how many rotations of the zoom ring you have to turn to go from 200-500.  The Sigma is much quicker.This lens does not have Image Stabilization which would have been nice but would probably add another couple hundred dollars and weight to it.  It does come in a very nice padded case and features a filter ring that can be adjusted with the hood on.  Filters are 86mm which are very costly.  Tripod mount is very solid and located well for easy access.Conclusion:  This is a great lens for the money.  It focuses fast and produces crisp pictures.  It is a slow aperature range but I have not had any issues in daylight with focus or speed.  I didn't want to spend 3 to 5 grand on a lens that I will not be using that much.  IMO, this is a specialized lens that I use for wildlife.  I might use it 20-25% of the time.  I normally shoot a 80-200 Nikon 2.8 for my sports and action photography.  This lens would not be very good for that task.
$SUMMARY.: For the price, Excellent

$review_text.: Works great after loading the amazon app store from the browser after going to amazon/app. The Play store that comes with it is crap, and does not offer Netflix, Hulu, Kinsington Office Suite, Anti-virus, Pandora, and all the free goodies, and tons of games. You also have to uncheck a couple things in settings like "Unknown App Sources" check to Allow, or amazon store will not load. You have to check the run "plug-ins" to view some online Flash Player movie sites. Youtube works great. My 3-year old broke mine soon as I got it all setup and was using it a couple days. I had a corded USB optical mouse plugged into it to use the onscreen keyboard, and he finally ran right through it, and it pulled the body from the 5V power socket, right off the PCB inside. I wound up opening it up to see if I could fix it being an old PCB designer. Teeny, tinny traces ripped from the board. Can't half see anymore and would need magnifier and super-fine tip soldering set to even attempt a brain surgery type repair. The board and the components are an amazing display of how small and miniaturized things have gotten since my old PCB designer intro-surface mount days, and through-hole days! The package is very solid and well made, except the two micro-usb sockets. They should improve the design of those. They are the weakest links, and are soldered to a couple small pads on only one side of the board, and they can be popped right off the board pretty easily, so be gentle with the two smaller USB ports! If anything breaks from cord pulling, it will be the power socket like on mine, and then the other one if used. P.S. the micro-SD slot works fine but you have to get the card pushed back past the metal housing with a small pointy tool. The HDMI plug is attached like a tank turret. You'd have to break the board in half, or melt it off with a blow torch to ever get that thing loose! (The device as a whole would break your TV's port before breaking the HDMI plug from the module) It's soldered to both sides, and a thicker gauge tin than the rest of the connectors. The full sized USB port is also soldered onto both sides, and is well attached. I discovered the antenna configuration everybody talks about concerning the Wi-Fi reception. It's high quality insulated wire about 4" long folded back inside, and strongly attached, but the problem is that the body of the device is 98% metal so it still blocks the RF, and acts as a shield to the antenna, though I don't think it's grounded. The antenna is not electrically connected to the metal shell. One could drill a small hole in the plastic cap near the root of the antenna wire and thread it through to the outside to get maximum connectivity. The end has a small screw in the middle, and once it's out, you can take off the end, and then the whole thing slides out the other side. The PCB assembly is captured in a plastic cradle that slides out in the direction of the HDMI like a drawer. It's pretty easy to remove if you need to get that antenna wire outside. I would not put it through the metal case, but through a small hole in the plastic end to avoid any shorting to the metal case. Aside from the two micro-usb ports, it's very robust and would not be afraid to put that antenna outside if you need to, and have some technical skill. Oh, and PS - There is a vinyl protective covering on the outside metal case to protect it during production and assembly to not scratch the anodized coloring. Peel that stuff off so the aluminum can better cool the unit. The plastic film is an insulator and helps to keep the unit warmer.

$REVIEW.: This is almost the PERFECT battery charger (for everything except 9V batteries).  At $22, it may also be the least expensive *smart* charger out there.  It has faced a lot of use over the past 2 years, and I've never had any problems.Most other smart chargers refuse to charge my years-old NiMH batteries, and I had resorted to dumb chargers to do the job.  Now I've tossed them all out, and this BC1HU is the only charger I'll use.  Those old batteries have continued to work great, even in high-drain devices like electric toothbrushes, and this charger gave them a new lease on life.  Although these days I'm craving more and more low-self discharge batteries (like the inexpensive Tenergy Centura's) in all my devices, but not quite enough to toss out old (but still working) NiMH batteries.It works great on all of Tenergy's batteries as well.  It's not the very fastest charger out there, but it charges plenty fast, and the somewhat lower speed means your NiMH batteries don't get quite so hot (which could shorten their lives).  The red/green LED indicators are much better than more expensive LCD based models that look impressive only when you first see them, and get annoying after some time.  With this charger, I can tell from across the room when even just one battery is done charging.Cons:9V battery charging resorts to dumb timer-based charging, and several people didn't read the instructions, and accidentally destroyed 9V batteries.  If only Tenergy would fix this ONE simple issue, I'd buy a dozen of these chargers for family and friends.  It doesn't need to charge 9v batteries fast, just smart & safely.The power supply doesn't fit inside the battery compartment.  If they'd move things around just a bit (without making the charger bigger), so the wall-wart and 12V car adapter would both fit nicely inside, it would be superb for traveling.A USB port (or two) would be a nice, convenient addition that wouldn't notably increase the price, as seen on other Tenergy chargers.  Twice as good if it worked while batteries are charging (most don't).  Several times better if it also supplied higher-power in order to quick charge phones and tablets.  Those features aren't worth increasing the price significantly, though, as USB adapters are under $10.If it doesn't compromise the strength/durability or size, a little bit of ventilation would be nice.  With 4xDs charging, I leave the lid up, just to be safe.  Then again, even with vents, I might still feel the need to leave it wide open...Some people might like an option to charge common Li-Ion batteries as well.  I've stayed far away from them, but 9V Li-Ion batteries are tempting.  And if it keeps getting more difficult to find good flashlights that run on standard (AA) batteries, I might eventually relent on 3.7V cylindrical cells as well.Charger comparison:I also had the Tenergy V-9688, but it rejects most of my older batteries as "bad" even though they still work very well.  It also gets batteries rather hot as it charges them more quickly.  The viewing angle on the LCD is horrible, and you can't tell from any distance whether it's done charging or not.  Its lid is flimsy and breakable.  And worst of all, it isn't any smarter when charging 9V batteries, either!  The poor labeling ("L" & "D") and prominent placement of the light/discharge buttons is also a terrible interface misdesign, which confuses average people and will result in many accidental discharges when they just want to see the charging status.Both model chargers run on 12V DC, so any $3 car plug is all you need for travel use (available from seller, and others), which I consider a big selling point, particularly for jobs like charging flash-light batteries while camping, or running from solar panels.

The movement of the head is smooth, tension is good when needed, and range of movement into portrait is very simple. I do not have droop of any kind on my longer lenses. The security catch works as advertised even with Wimberly brackets which I know is important to some.The one thing I have a love hate relationship with on this is the auto-level catch. When you push it into position it will auto level the camera straight. This is cool and works very well. The problem is that you cant move anything unless this is disengaged and there is the slight issue. It can be slightly troublesome at times to flip the switch back to normal position.Oh yeah, the pano feature on this is awesome as well!

$REVIEW.: I've had this for a couple of years.  I use the Bose cube system speakers and sub for $1,000.  I am totally happy with this.  I have unlimited power, It has great fidelity at any volume I've dared to use so far.  It seems to be built to go into the future - as it has the mid back channels, where all the movies seem to be in the 5.1 format.  You can tell each of the system imputs what audio format you want it to use, and it remembers.  I'm not sure if it knows what format the DVD or blue ray is in and adjusts, but to my inexperience, we usually play with the various modes, or pick one of the THX or cinema modes.  The sound is so good, its hard to tell them apart.  It even makes the old mono Beatles recordings sound good.The only minor drawback I've found is its bulk and weight.  We have a glass TV stand with room for components on shelves.  I was concerned with the weight on the glass, so I got a couple of 1 inch dowels and cut them to support the glass under the feet of the unit right to the floor.  I spray painted them black to blend in, and I don't have to worry about the weight.  I'm pretty sure it would have been ok without, but I feel better making the extra support.  We're moving and this will be one of the first things I unpack and set up.

$review_text.: Device only supports up to two devices, not two additional.Any device with wifi can connect to the peel
 It is a hotspot, not exclusive to IPODs, although the 2nd and 3rd gen will fit in the device the 4 gen will not fit
 The 4 gen will still connect just like it would to any hotspot
 Most hotspots connect more than two devices, but at the same time are much more expensive
 I think this device is a great idea, but a little ahead of the hardware available to it.Cons: Set up is awkward
Needs a new model to fit gen 4


 Needs better on/off/standby switch
 Charge does not last very long, but most mobile hotspots don't last more than a few hours

Needs a removable sync port cover so IPOD's can dock or use sync cable
More data plan options needed


1gig is good for web browsing and email, but that's it


Overuse charges are insane, maybe tracking app/software should be included.Suggestion: Needs better integrated way to charge so you don't need yet another cable to charge the peel as well as the ipod(maybe have a connector in the peel for the ipod sync port that will allow you to use the peel charger to charge the peel and the ipod while installed at the same time).

$REVIEW.: I've been a Photoshop user for years, using it to enhance my jewelry photographs or wild bird photos. My version of Photoshop, however, is old and I wanted to work with newer and less pricey editing software. This is my first experience with Corel's Paint Shop Pro, so I can't speak to the improvements in X6 Ultimate.Installation was easy and straightforward. Two disks come in the package: the PaintShop Pro X6 Ultimate installation files and a second disk: FaceFilter Studio 3, each with its own serial number printed on the sleeve. Since the fast results described in the writeup require a 64-bit OS, I installed on my HP laptop running Windows 7. So far, I have only done simple cropping, brightness and a few quick selection tools, I can't speak to the strengths of this software, but it certainly handles all the items I require for my particular photo editing with as much ease as my old Photoshop and without a lengthy learning curve.PaintShop Pro is quite user friendly and easy to learn, however, some amazing video tutorials are available online to guide you through using all of the tools, including RAW editing, HDR, layers and more. The video tutorials are available at learn.corel.com.The bonus pack includes Athentech Imaging's Perfectly Clear to add color vibrancy, noise and tint removal with one click and FaceFilter 3, the standard edition. This provides the ultimate beauty kit for redefining expressions, portrait enhancement and several photo effects to make your photos sparkle with professionalism. So far, I've tried these on some flowers shot in macro mode with more than acceptable results. I plan to do a more in depth exploration with portraiture. But for now, I feel PaintShop Pro is every bit as helpful as my Photoshop 6 at about one sixth the cost.

$REVIEW.: The Mipow BOOMAX is different from most other Bluetooth speakers I've used because it has dual 3 W drivers for true stereo


 It also has a very stylish design with a durable anodized aluminum alloy body and grille and a detachable soft-touch plastic handle for portability.The Bluetooth pairs easily as MiPow_BOOMAX and the aptX codec provides impeccable transmission


 Sound quality is better than most other miniature rechargeable portable speakers because of the dual drivers

 It also has a bit better bass than most, partly because of two equalizer settings, but the sound is otherwise what would be expected for something so tiny:  fun and enjoyable, though not audiophile-quality.The battery will last for at least ten hours and a 3.5 mm audio cable is included
 It can support connecting two phones at the same time, but I haven't experimented with that.

$review_text.: We had a black out caused by a storm about a year ago. Well after the 3rd days with no power, hot shower and a frig that was warm & rancid milk, I was desperate.  I have a family with 3 small children to care for. Well my neighbor works for the company that manufactures these cables as an engineer and has always bragged about how great they were. Well he was kind enough to lone me a half dozen cables of a new prototype design and I gave them a go.Not only was my house power back up to normal with in minutes but as I was standing there in awe my head started to itch. I mean really itch, I started scratching my bald head and felt fuzz all over my previously bald head. I rushed into the bathroom and looked into the mirror. To my surprise my hair was growing back before my eyes. I was in shock, you could see it growing as you watched. With in 45 minutes my hair had grown back completely! I have looked like Mr. Potato head for 20 years and suddenly I have a full head of hair again. Only one thing could have caused this! "IT WAS THE PROTOTYPE CABLES". That wasn't the end of it either. I herd my wife crying and rushed into our bedroom. I thought she was in pain but they were tears of happiness. She was standing in front of  the mirror with a brand new set of 38D's and a 24 inch waist, and she is 48 years old. But now she looked 28 years old.I could go on and on about these cables and all they have done for us. (Like my three children winning the Nobel peace prize and how they solved world hunger, BUT I will do that in another post when I update my experience with these incredible cables) These cables are worth every cent. I am a believer and so is my entire family. Pick up a dozen "NOW"! It will change your life. I'm not sure how they work, and my IQ is now 658 up from 108 (those cables again). Its could be the Noise-Dissipation System and the Counter-Spiral Geometry but my bet its really the flamadootles unversed to the square mean ratio vortex, coupled with their patented inner freshness lock & seal package. I will post updates soon on any new benefits derived from this product.

$REVIEW.: The idea behind these cloud drives is extremely cool and I love the access I can get through my Android phone not to mention the great price I got here on Amazon.  BUT: as long as the drive is active on my network, none of my other things work ie, internet, getting mail, etc.  Installing the drive was very easy and I only made one call to customer support about some password issues which they took care of right away.  Customer support is top notch IF you get someone with good english speaking skills.  If I want to use my network for, internet, mail, netflix blurays, then I must turn off the cloud drive. With the drive on, access to any of these is severly diminished. Worst of all, mail will NOT download with the drive on, ever! (possible timeout problem) After a few page reloads I can semi surf the internet but it's still very frustrating. Bluray access to netflix is the least problematic but still affected. Another part that could be better is the fact that you can only see a max of 5 gb of pictures using the WD Pictures android app, I have hundreds of gb of pics in a dozen different folders, but the app only shows 4 of my folders which I assume equals the 5 gb limit. The WD 2Go App is very nice too, but you'll need to know the exact name of the file you want, ie. I have pictures that are from my digital camera and the naming schedule is basically a few letters and a lot of numbers, so without a preview you'll have to know exactly what you want in order to open it.  The best thing they could do to improve the drive would be to add an On/Off switch and possibly a USB connection for my main computer.  Over all I really love this drive but it's a hassle turning it back on when I need it.  WD has great products (I have several) and perhaps in the future they'll get this one a bit more user friendly.WD Team, if you have a way to stop my drive from hogging my network please help me.I've had my drive for about a month now, and to be honest I don't know much about networking, but these are just problems i'm seeing with my system. If I can get my main problem resolved, this would be a 5 star item hands down.

$review_text.: I got mine about a week ago.... darn, I paid $31 more! But I must say I was really surprised at the quality of the videos and the stills I capture with my ACDSee software. It's also very nicely made, not cheap. It's so small and light that it adds no weight at all to my hand bag. I did get the extra battery and stand alone charger for nearly $50 more. The battery is about the same size as my mobile phone battery. It comes with a USB extension cord for use with a desktop computer, and a clear rubbery sleeve/case. It's really nice. At this price, I'd buy them for gifts.* You do have to hold the camera as steady as possible, but the quality of the video is still good, even if a little jumpy while walking around and recording. I was concerned about the lack of stabilizer when I ordered the camera, but the video is a lot better than I expected. And, as I mentioned, the stills I capture are good size 2.6mb files, decent enough quality for a 5x7 print.* I never installed the software that came with the camera. I have so many graphic software packages already on my computer, and because this camera captures in a compatible format and the files are in AVI format, all my current software is able to view and edit the video files.* I find the camera easy to hold, especially with the sleeve that it comes with. The very first time I touched the control buttons, they did move faster than I expected, but not so that it took any time to get use to.

$review_text.: Amazon says this is exactly what I purchased last time, and I've tried very hard to make sure I bought a genuine Panasonic part, not a cheapo clone. This time I was disappointed that two of the metal clips which hold the bulb to the plastic frame were not installed. They were flopping around loose inside the packaging, and with some long needlenose pliers and a lot of patience I got them were they should have been, using my old one as a guide. (Being very careful not to touch the glass, only the plastic frame) A reputable factory would not send out something that's not finished this way. Now it's in and works, but I question if it's a genuine Panasonic and if it will perform to spec for brightness (the primary reason to choose this projector over others) and bulb longevity.

$review_text.: I am so glad I purchased this projector! I bought a 110in screen and a sound bar to go along with it
I hooked my Playstation3 up to it and movies and games look amazing! I tell everyone that I built a movie theater and when they see it they are all jealous! I have been showing off my &#34;Life of Pi&#34; BluRay and a bunch of horror movies to everyone and they find it very impressive


The amazing scenery in &#34;Life of Pi&#34; looks so surreal and when something jumps out in a horror film it actually makes you jump versus not so much on a normal TV
After seeing how clear and vibrant the picture looks, you will be so glad you did not spend MUCH more on a different projector


I've seen them priced all the way up into the thousands, what a joke!

$review_text.: Sandisk Compact flash has performed very well for me for about 4 years. This model is great, especially at today's prices.The Extreme III product is fast enough to take RAW+JpegFine images on my Nikon D200 up to about 12-18 images non-stop. At five frames per second, I never miss the action. My key objective is great photography, not videography. Some people may be conflicted between a CAMERA and CAMCORDER usage.Speed can be more of an issue during uploading onto my computer, where USB 2.0 is good, but I don't expect hard drive speed from Compact Flash. I simply take a break while uploading the images.This product will allow high speed photography on a Nikon D200. Some cameras models don't have enough in-camera memory BUFFER storage to capture a long burst of images. I wouldn't blame the Extreme III compact flash speed for this shortcomming, but recommend an upgraded camera body instead.Of course, I don't want or need 50 frames of "motion picture" sequences, yet this is possible with small jpeg ONLY image sizes. A 10 megapixel RAW image requires lots of storage.

$review_text.: This is a more than adequate center speaker for 90% of the people out there who are looking for one. If you are an over-the-top audiophile and/or money is no object, you may want to look elsewhere, but the vast majority of people will be perfectly satisfied with this speaker. Remember, a center speaker's main use is for dialogue in 5.1, so it is the reproduction of midrange frequencies -- particularly 1500-3000 Hz -- that is important. And the TL1 does this job quite well.I have mine paired (singled?) with a pair ofInfinity Primus P153 bookshelf speakers(I would have gotten the P163s, but Amazon had the P153s for 60% off, a deal I couldn't resist), aPolk Audio 10-Inch subwoofer, and a pair of older Yamaha surrounds that were mounted in the ceiling years ago. The Polk TL1 plays well with these and, leaving aside the surrounds, the whole set up ran not much more than 260 clams. Can't beat that with a stick.To top it off, the TL1 has a very low profile, which may be important to many people because a center speaker is always sitting just below (or hanging just above) the screen. It is somewhat reminiscent in its profile of those MP3 or Bluetooth speaker units that Logitech sells, albeit slightly bulkier. If you're the kind of person who really wants to draw attention to the fact you have a center speaker and a 5.1 setup (you know who you are -- you always remove the grills on all of your speakers, too!), this probably isn't for you.

$REVIEW.: I have purchased G766 in SAMS club recently and have tried it for few days with all options to ensure it works for me and reading at other reviews, almost all of the reviews are true or accurate because I tried all the features and I know most of the comments are applicable. Before my review comments I would like to mention that I am tech savy and I do understand &#34;how stuff works&#34;. Before trying this I tried Lorex, Swann Wired systems and also Unidens another wireless model from Fry's.After trying wired and wireless units my recommendation is buy this unit if you are monitoring activity around the house while at home, like kids/wife at home having the comfort of seeing who is at the door, not having to go and peak outside or if you are at home and want to watch maybe pets, kids playing outside, deliveries or solicitors so you can watch a movie with the portable lcd on the side along with your popcorn.If you are planning to use this to watch your home outside of your home, I mean via internet it is a bad idea because of several limitations that makes this great device useless.Features that doesn't work or not there:1. Sends and email with just text and does not send the image when motion is detected.2. Remote viewing via app is frustrating and primitive, cannot view all cameras at once but works well with instant streaming of the activity though.3. Cannot record video on your mobile device, can only take snapshot if you are watching the screen at the timeof the activity.4. Motion sense email alert is hot or a miss and is not reliable.5. Remote monitoring via web browser is a joke. It is very primitive like Windows 95 and as other reviewers mentioned it is clucky, buggy and compatibility issues but when it works it is ok but have to view one camera at a time. I was using Windows 8.1 though.6. Video is recorded in clips of MP4 videos on an SD card and have no option to view remotely or system does not overwrite the old ones if it is full.7. Do not sound alarm when motion is detected so Uniden expects us to sit in front of the monitor and watch it all day maybe night too.... ridiculous. Maybe they shoulkd label these as &#34;Baby Monitors&#34; rather than Surveillance system....8. No ability to record on external drive or NAS drives9. Power cable should be through the mounting stand so that it is not exposed outside for easy tampering.10. For the remote monitoring to work the LCD unit must be docked into the base unit.Good Features:1. Simple to install and no wires no mess.2. Portable wireless monitor is a big plus so you can take it around the house.3. Wireless capability is great and have no issue moving around my two bed room 2000 Sft house with walls etc. Didn't notice any interference with my WiFi as other reviewers mentioned.4. Cameras and base unit takes the same adapter and is very small and compact and not ugly bulky adapters.I will update more feedback as I keep using them.

$REVIEW.: I bought the HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset to wear under my gear while I commute to work on my motorcycle. The earbuds do a great job of staying in my ears in spite of the worst possible conditions - heat or cold, sweat or contact with the inside of my helmet. They've been exposed to some crummy conditions but seem to be holding up just fine. Sound quality is about average, but the headset volume is high enough to be heard over the roar of the exhaust and the wind noise.Call quality appears to be just fine; I've heard no complaints from folks talking to me on the unit. It should be noted that I am NOT talking about using the headset for calling while riding, because the microphone is on the front of the unit which is under my jacket. Connections are perfect every time, and I've not had a call with any echos or delays.I also like the long battery life. This unit has some LEGS!Cons? I can't really think of any. Since the headset wasn't engineered for the purposes I put it to, I am doubly impressed by its durability and functionality.

$review_text.: I own this unit for about 6 weeks now, and so far it works pretty good. From my experience so far I would recommend it - here is some (hopefully) relevant info about this clock/camera:- unit is small, but feels pretty sturdy and well-crafted- I leave it plugged into an outlet - the rechargeable battery alone lasts 4 hours when recording (according to the seller), and about a day without recording (according to me)- get a USB extension cable - the USB cord supplied does not reach an outlet close to the ground if the clock is on a table- video resolution can be set to 640 x 480; out of the box it was 320 x 240- video settings (resolution, video quality, night mode, etc) can be changed when you are in recording mode, and go to &lt;monitor settings> using the volume forward or reverse buttons (thanks to Inspector Gadget for mentioning this in his review!)- out of the box, night vision is weak - can be improved by going into &lt;monitor settings> and set &lt;DV night mode> to "on"; it was "off" out of the box, even though it still had some IR recording capabilities (? - not sure why) - anyway, with &lt;DV night mode> on, you get an OK-ish quality 6-7 feet range in a completely dark room- Mini SD card that comes with the package deal is a class 4 card- out of the box it records 30 min clips, each clip is approx. 30-50 MB in size (for 320x240) or 200-300MB (for 640x480 in high quality) - so for an overnight recording, you would find 20+ clips, each 30 min long, in the morning (video clip length can be changed in &lt;monitor settings> to either 10min, 30min, or 1hr)- this also implies that you get about 15 days of continuous recording on a 16GB card on the lowest 320x240 setting; on the better 640x480 setting, your 16GB card is filled up after about 3 days.- MAC users: this unit gives me a weird problem: when I connect it directly via USB, it keeps mounting multiple desktop icons (and by that I mean many, i.e. >10, and just keeps going). Somewhat annoying, so I just pop out the SD card, put it into an adapter and put that in my iMac. Takes 5 seconds and works nicely. Anybody else encountered this issue, with either Mac or PC?- MAC users: there might be a difference playing videos when using QuickTime Player versus other players (VLC, MPlayerX etc) in regards to sound

$REVIEW.: Pros: 60fps 720p recording, Cheap accessories, Good still shots, Size, Price.Cons: Low light recording mediocre, No stability control, Battery life.I was on the fence between the Flip Mino camcorder and the Aiptek A-HD/A-HD+.  I made the decision to go with the A-HD+, simply because it had 60fps 720p recording, and I would be taking a LOT of action shots.  The camera's main attraction is the 1080p recording, but I have not yet tried this, and will update when I use it in detail.  On that front, it delivers!  In broad daylight, the A-HD+ shoots a very clean and bright HD picture, in the full 60fps as advertised.  The generated files are having a hard time playing back at the full frame rate on my laptop (Core2Duo 2GHz, 2GB RAM, 256MB Video), but when playing back directly to my HDTV, it runs at 60fps without a hitch.  The camcorder has some trouble recording at the full 60fps indoors or in low light situations though... the Night mode improved the brightness of the picture, but at the cost of half the fps and some artifacts in the picture.  The zoom feature does what it needs to do, although I do wish it zoomed in more smoothly.  Recorded audio quality is OK, I encountered no clipping or distortion that was reported on the A-HD.  Accessories for this camera are dirt cheap, and three add-ons are essential for getting the most out of this one - Tripod, at least a 4GB SD card, and extra batteries.  Thankfully, all three are relatively cheap, so nothing to worry about on that front.Still shots are very nice and I feel 5MP is the optimal setting for taking pictures.  There is a one second delay from when you click and when the flash actually goes off, too much time for human error... any tripod alleviates this issue.  For the price, this one trumps any other camcorder out there in it's price range.The loose battery problem is definitely there, but I fixed the problem by cutting a playing card in half, and taping it to the inside of the compartment, absolutely no problems now!

$review_text.: I was looking for a small action camera I could use to mount on my RC quadcopters that could provide good quality HD video. I've used a few other models, but was left disappointed. I purchased this camera after watching several reviews by Techmoan and a few others on Youtube, which praised this little technological wonder. The camera comes equipped with several different mounts and cables. When I first used the camera, I was amazed with the video quality at 1080p (30fps). The entire image was well detailed and most importantly, the camera does a great job at coping with light and dark scenes. I also tried the camera in my car as a dashcam and was equally pleased at the results. I decided to permanently mount it in my car and will purchase another Mobius for my other vehicle.There is a utility you can download which lets you update the firmware and change every conceivable setting on the camera. In the 6 months I've owned the camera, there have been as many firmware updates, which shows continued development for this camera. They have recently added motion sensing and time-lapse through FW updates.This is a great little camera - I highly recommend it!

$review_text.: The Veebeam HD is a great little device if you are only interested in streaming movies and music from your laptop. In my opinion, there are too many cons to make this worth you money at the moment. For instance, you can only use this on a laptop. No exceptions. I have tried this on 3 desktops, 1 Mac and two PCs, and all have failed to work.Another major problem is the range is extremely short, reaching about 15 feet. At that range you would be better off buying a $10 HDMI cable the reaches just as far! Also the receiver has to be in sight of the dock, which means you can't have your laptop in another room, charging or hooked up to the internet, while streaming your media. Also, this Veebeam only streams music, videos, and displays websites (with an annoying 1-2 second lag). It does not stream games, or .exe programs which I assumed would work, seeing as it does everything else...  That lack of a feature really renders this useless for gamers or anyone who would like to use this as a secondary display (not mentioning the lag.)Furthermore, in the description it says, and I quote "When you're ready to watch a movie, plug the USB antenna into your laptop and stream anything directly to your TV. It's that simple." That is not the case. You have to go to their website and download an application that is always running in the background of your computer which adds another tab every time you right click on a media file. Besides it being annoying, (I like the minimal amount of tabs/windows open as possible) it also, to some extent, drains your laptop's battery and hardware resources. When you're on battery life and working on a project, every minute counts when you're trying to finish. So all in all, it does mostly what is says in the description, butONLY that, nothing else. Really it's not worth the $150 that you would be wasting on it. Buy a HDMI or VGA cable instead and save yourself some money. (Unless of course you have some extra money to blow in!)  ;)

$REVIEW.: I wish I could show you a photo of the contact points inside of this adapter. Instead of having a ring of tabs that makes contact with the rings on the 3.5mm plugs, there are only single taps that are offset that make contact. What that means is that if you wiggle the plug, you will 1) bend the tiny tabs and it will never fit right anymore, and 2) it will cut in and out at times.The worst part is that they are labeled as quality. The best quality adapter I have seen are often bundled with headphones from Sony, Sennheiser, and V-Moda. Why can't manufactures sell quality 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapters!?
$SUMMARY.: Complete garbage, contact points inside the adapter are just tabs!

 Maybe it's just my eyes, but there is a very faint picture degrading when using the switcher versus a direct HDMI input from the cable box

$review_text.: This IPOD has a lot of problems and in my opinion is NOT worth the inflated cost. Here are my problems with it.1. It doesn't support FLAC, OGG or any other high quality transfers.2. The video function is a pain and difficult to use, unless you want to pay high costs on itunes for movies3. The battery is not nearly as long-lasting as they suggest, and they are prone to die after a year leaving you with an expensive repair.4. They scratch very easily.5. They often freeze and I have found that the IPOD can't seem to handle over 15 GBs without freezing constantly.6. They often need to be "reformated" which means that you lose all of your music collection from the ipod and must start again.But, my biggest gripe is how fragile these things are. I bought mine from best buy on warantee and within two months the IPOD headphone socket was messed up and I had to bring it back, they couldn't fix it so they gave me another one. Now a year later, I am having more troubles because the IPOD often refuses to sync. I have lost my entire collection of IPOD library countless times and need to re-enter all of the albums again which is a huge pain. I bought this thing for convenience and I am wishing I would have just kept my portable disc player!Buy a cheaper portable digital media player you wont regret it!

$REVIEW.: First off, the Ceton tech support is operated by Smoke & Mirrors, Inc.; so you'd get better "service" from a 1-900#.I've been building home theater PCs for over 10 years, and have never had any trouble configuring drivers so that everything works really well.If anyone remembers the Pinnacle DV500, that so many people complained about because they couldn't get it to work right, and even a lot of the reviews like Tom's Hardware even mentioned that configuring it was fairly advanced, i had no problem getting that thing to work rock solid and fast.So, i've done a lot of this, and this card is absolutely the flakiest device i have ever installed - no contest.And it has absolutely nothing to do with installation or configuration. Despite what some of the other reviews say about getting it working with the cable company, that is pretty straight forward; just have the multi-stream cable-card and the tuning adapter on hand before you start. And probably the most important thing is to speak to absolutely no one at the cable company other than the cable card people. If anyone else gets involved they will not have a clue, and it will go downhill fast. But the cable card people will know all about the card you are installing, and how to get it working.So this isn't where the problem with this card is at all. Once it is supposedly working, it is just flat out flaky. Chronically, i get messages that a program cannot be recorded because there are no available tuners when absolutely nothing else is recording. And other times it will record on all 4 channels with no problem.Right, so since this was installed on a machine that already had a TV tuner card i figured maybe there was a driver conflict and i reinstalled Win7 so it would be an absolutely clean install. Even after the reinstall, it is just as flaky as ever.I mean this goes on all the time on an i7/Asus system with an obscene amount of memory.And here is something else to consider. Unlike analog tuner cards, everything that you record is protected by the PlayReady DRM. If you ever do reinstall windows, or change hardware, all of your recordings will be lost. I mean they will still be taking up hard drive space, but the DRM will think that the recordings have been transferred to another computer and they will not play. What a joke.This device was an absolute waste of $$$$.

It has to be paired with one of the 1Gb original memory sticks; searching this issue on Google reveals that this is not an uncommon occurrence.I've added PNY memory to other computers and know it works well.  I think the issue I'm having is confined to my Macbook and has nothing to do with the memory I added.  Just to confirm, I tested both PNY 2Gb memory sticks, and they both work fine individually.  It's just that my Macbook will only recognize 3Gb at a time.  When both 2Gb sticks are in, the Macbook won't start.

The card allows me to use my canon xt in large jpeg + raw and get about 1000+ shots


However DO NOT FORMAT IN CAMERA!!!!! I formatted the card by accident and it read as a 8gb card I contacted transcend and they were able to guide me thru the process of bringing the card back to 14.9gb


For me this card paid for itself during a school sporting event when my camera went for about 3 shots more than the others at the event and I got the shot with the 2nd place runner overtaking the front and winning by a foot whereas everyone else had a shot of the first place runner about to cross the line then in the next shot was with the 2nd runner already crossing the line.

$REVIEW.: I needed a DVD Recorder with a built in digital tuner.  (My other machine, a Toshiba D-R4, only has an analog tuner.)  I chose this unit simply because I had Best Buy store credit that I had to use the day I got it, and this was the only DVD Recorder in the store with a digital tuner at a reasonable price.I use this machine for basic, off-the-air timer recording when I am not home or asleep.  And yes, it does the job, and the disks look great.  But compared to the Toshiba, it is a major pain to program.  The unit takes way too long to start up, and the timer recording process is not easy.  I have been programming VCRs to record shows since I bought my first BetaMax in 1976, and I can say without a doubt, this machine has the most user-UNFRIENDLY process for timer recording this I've ever experienced.  On top of that, the process for finishing the DVD afterward is also a pain, especially compared to what I was used to with my Toshiba.Furthermore, when recording a show which is broadcast digitally in 16 x 9, the machine records it as 4 x 3 letterbox, and when you play it back, it appears in a window, so you have to zoom in to fill your screen.  There's really no excuse for that.I can't speak to its editing capability or any of the more advanced functions because I don't use it for anything other than off the air recording.Therefore, I can't recommend this unit. There must be a machine that has a far better user interface than this has, so do your homework!  (I wish I had!)

The keys have a fairly clean feel, with a good stoke and a slight click, perhaps a little mushier than optimal but good nonetheless. My big problem is that if you write as much as I do, after a million or so words, the letter labels wear off the more commonly used keys. Fortunately, they are not terribly expensive, so I simply replace them. But at the time of replacement, they invariably still work just fine. Good, solid, workaday product.

$REVIEW.: I ordered an assortment of 1, 3 and 7 foot cables to connect 2 gigabit switches and half dozen PCs and two servers. I had been using older Cat 5e and felt it was time to refresh the cables.  I have tested the cables using my applications and they are performing as well as the 5e cables were doing.  The limit is in the applications, not the cables.I did notice that I was cussing while disconnecting the older cables.  You know, the ones with the little nubbin that refuses to disconnect.  I smiled as I connected the snagless cables.  Everything works as expected and I am a happy camper.  I have ordered another 4 cables to round out my refresh.Prices are right.  Performance is great.Oh, and I'm cussing less.Update ========================================================= (8 months later)I may have cussed less after threading these cables through my racks, but 8 months later I'm ready to replace them.  They don't snag, but after 8 months that little nubbin doesn't release anymore on several of the cables.  Not all, but enough so that I'd not use this manufacturer again.

$REVIEW.: So I'm a T-Mobile convert and wanted to test the waters of the network without a large capital commitment and let me tell you this little phone is surprising.Only downside is the Windows App store limitations, which is nothing against the actual functionality of this phone. Turn off background apps and this thing runs a while!The phone is little (the 4 inches of screen is very narrow) but the touch sensitivity is great.Also, I had never used Windows Phone OS before and it is zippy. You look at the specs of this phone and think it's going to be sluggish, but the interface and launching apps is very fast. *** That being said, if you are used to Android or iOS then you will be disappointed. There are a lot of apps that I truly love on those (Plume, Flipboard, Cartwheel, Dunkin Donuts Pay, Starbucks Pay, Snip Snap) that are not available on Windows. That might not be a big deal for people newly getting into smartphones, but now that I know what's out there, it is hard to be satisfied with less.The screen resolution is poor compared to high end phones, but due to the smaller screen size it is not unbearable to look at by any means.I love how all of the battery saving options are made very clear and background apps are identified so you don't overdrain your battery. That said, if you use your phone heavily, the battery can drain aggressively when doing various functions, but it also warns you when the battery drops significantly in a short period, so if you know you won't be near an outlet soon, you can change your usage habits.Also, the Nokia Offline Music and Here Maps are crazy! Download some stuff while you're online then you can have access to GPS Maps and music offline for FREE!?!?!I honestly bought it because I knew at the very least I get a $70 GPS/MP3 player that has Wifi capability and can be a back up phone if I need.Shocked, surprised, impressive, all for the price point.You have to know what you're getting into and I'm a pretty big tech nerd (I used to have a Google Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and right now this thing performs faster and is less glitchy.Battery life is also acceptable. Read the Microsoft tips page on the website for battery saving and don't use it 24/7 and you can get most likely get a full day out of it, provided you aren't constantly downloading/watching stuff.Anyone who is hesitant about Windows phones or T-Mobiles network this is THE start phone to get.Let me know if you have questions, but considering I was running a high end phone before and still like this little guy (a lot) it's hard to go wrong at the price with T-Mobiles $30 unlimited data and text plan, it makes it a smartphone you can actually use all the time as a smartphone.

$REVIEW.: I purchased 4 of these cameras as a christmas gift for my relatives who didn't have a digital camera and who I knew wanted to break into the digital world. After a lot of research online + with prior excellent experience with Canon cameras and camcorders (have 2 other cannon cameras & 1 cannon camcorder), this was a natural choice for me. Price was another consideration. Its very very affordable, entry level camera that consistently takes excellent pictures and videos and lives up to the Cannon legacy. The modes are very basic as compared to some higher end models and qualify for a basic shoot-and-point camera; but then, what else do the uninitiated, middle aged people want??? Its best feature is its ease of use. Just select, point and shoot! I've seen even people with advanced settings often use the "Auto" mode more often as a rule than an exception. I myself do!!The only minor fault I noticed was its cheaper-made-in-china look. You expect more from a cannon, and that goes for looks as well. Doesn't look too bad, but closer inspection does reveal a not so smooth finish, and its indeed made in china.Apart from that, there are no quality or functional issues whatsoever.Battery life is great, weights very less, easy to carry around, comes with its own handy software (which you don't HAVE TO install) and definitely worth its money.The best christmas gift I gave ever. And everybody really loved it!

 It is critical that her phone remain operational because she has children and always wants to be available.It comes in handy for anyone around her


 She's basically a refuel station for all of her friends
 I've used it several times myself

 It charges anyone's phone much faster than their regular charger.I will have to warn everyone to not use the 2 amp port for charging their phones consistently


 Sure, it will charge your phone in a third of the time, but your phone will stop charging with your typical wall charger.We can get close to three completely dead phones fully charged with this device.

$review_text.: It's a great card for $64
I'm not concerned with benchmarks and ultra-settings


I just want my 30fps on medium or better detail in games, and this card has delivered that with the 10 or so games I've played on my system


If you want benchmarks, I'd go ahead and spend the extra $60ish for ddr5.During a decent load, the card runs around 40-42 C (i'd like to see it closer to 35, but really..
it's not hurting at 40), while the cpu runs around 34 with the same load
My pc room temp will be 68-78 F depending on the time of day
Installing drivers was as easy as putting an install CD in and clicking a couple of times


The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is the size
It will take up 2 slots
Wasn't a problem at all with my setup, but if you're pressed for space, this might not be your optimal choice.Overall, it rocks for a $64 vid card


Great for budget-builds with decent/moderate gaming performance.

$review_text.: I have been looking for a camera with a greater zoom for nearly a year. I have a Canon AS 590 IS bought through Amazon which takes excellent photographs, but it only has a 4X zoom. I take indoor, outdoor, low light, wildlife pictures and pictures for a local flea market. I wanted a longer zoom for the wildlife pictures that the Canon could not reach.I looked at cameras with a 10X to 30X zoom from $150 to $400 and read all the customer reviews and all the professional reviews. The pro reviews usually showed pictures taken at full zoom which was very helpful. Any camera I saw in the stated price range has a slight softening to a horrible softening at full telephoto.Last Saturday I was disappointed with all of them for the long zoom shots. I saw a sale flyer for this Panasonic DMC-FH25 at $99, so I looked on Amazon and reviews were extremely favorable. I found a pro review and the zoom shots were the best I had seen. I decided to buy the camera, figuring if nothing else, the zoom was worth $99.I have used the camera all week long and it has been equal or better to my beloved Canon and the zoom is as good as advertized. I have an old oak tree 100 yards behind the house and with the E Zoom button I focused and shot the picture. The photo came out so well I can see the bark pattern on the tree.The camera is very easy to use and with the IA mode (Intelligent Auto) I did not have to do anything but press the shutter button (after pressing half way down to allow the auto focus to lock) and the pictures are great. So far it is the best $99 I have ever spent.Pros: Super easy using IA mode and excellent results (sharp pics)E Zoom one touch button uses 8X optical zoom and digital zoom to make 18x with no visable picture degradation.Exposure levels can be changed by pressing one button on back of the camera. This is great for getting the right exposure on a white flower under a bright sun.LCD on back can be set so you can hold the camera up over your head and still see the screen. This is great if you are behind a crowd but want to take a picture of an event.Quick menu button enables you to make menu changes on the fly to improve light compensation filters.It is super easy shifting from stills to movie mode at 720p. And movies look very good.Battery life is very good. It ran for hours while I accustomed myself with camera features. Battery comes out easily and recharges in an external supplied charger.Camera is very small, yet feels good and looks great.LCD screen has modes to adjust for taking pictures in bright light.Party mode takes great indoor low light pictures.Cons: No manual focus, but then the auto focus works very well.Battery takes over two hours to recharge from a complete drain.Movie mode files are .MOV and need to be converted to .WMV for Windows Media Player. There are ways if you search on the Internet.Software that comes with the camera for picure handling was barely adequate. I just use my Canon software instead.So far those are the only drawbacks. I will update if I find more things good or bad.Update 4-17-2012 The battery is easy to remove and reinstall. It takes just under 2 hours to recharge from zero. The battery and SDcard cover is just a slide on off so no worry about it breaking the plastic. The battery is good for 200 pictures without flash and indoor pictures are good without flash under normal daytime conditions. You can take all your pictures using IA mode if you care to do so. Macro pictures are great. AF Zoom allows you to take a macro from 3 feet away. Indoor pictures usually snap at 400 ISO without a lot of noise. I have posted some pictures taken today on my blog at [...]/ You can judge for yourself.

$review_text.: This is an amazing piece of hardware, backed by a company with an even better customer support system.While CableCard may not be the best option for someone who is computer-illiterate, you don't need to have a degree in Computer Engineering to make this work for you
 I think a lot of people are hesitant to take the plunge, but with just a modicum of of a sense of adventure, you can start using this product, which as a DVR will simultaneously outperform every set-top box that your cable company wants to rent to you, while doing so for considerably less in monthly fees


 This thing is simultaneously cheaper AND better

 It's chalk-full of *win*
 All you need to start using it is a desktop PC with:1) An available PCIe x1 bus

 If you don't know what that is, simply google-image "PCIe x1"

 The prongs shown sticking out of the bottom of the Ceton InfiniTV 4 plug into this connection, which if you have one, can be found inside your PC

 If you don't have such a connection available, you should instead check out the "Ceton InfiniTV 4 USB", which is a similar-but-external device that will connect to your desktop via an available USB connection.2) Sufficient RAM


 Ceton recommends 4 Gigs


 If you'll want to have 3-4 users simultaneously (more on this later), you might want to be open to the idea of expanding to 8 gigs.3) Sufficient hard drive space to start laying down Recordings
 I'd recommend a 2-gig internal


 You can always offload recordings that you want to keep to an external hard-drive (as long as they aren't DRM-copy-protected, which often happens with HBO/Showtime/ect recordings).4) If you want to hook a TV up directly to your PC, having a video card capable of outputting HDMI is likely ideal.5) A Multi-channel CableCard (otherwise known as "M-Card") which you will rent from your local cable provider


 If you don't have any other equipment, many cable companies will give you the first card for free

 The rates on additional CableCards is often times somewhere between $2/month and $8/month, which is considerably less than renting a HDDVR set top box from your cable provider.Once you have all of those things covered, instillation and activation is pretty easy and very straight-forward.Once up-and-running, if your desktop is connected to your Network, then various other devices (like XBox 360's and the new Ceton Echo, for example) can access all of your PC's TV recordings and even take remote control over one of the 4 TV tuners


 So with some up-front equipment expenses (PC, Ceton InfiniTV, and perhaps a couple of Xbox 360's or Ceton Echo's), you can dramatically reduce your monthly cable bill, because each of these devices can be hooked up to a TV and, while connected to your network, provide your entire cable channel lineup and all television recordings to each of them (tuning to up-to-4-channels-at-once) while no longer paying your cable provider to rent any equipment


 So if you have 4 HDTVs in 4 rooms, and you're paying to rent 4 seperate boxes from the Cable Provider, those charges can all come off your bill, and all 4 TVs will be able to access the same TV recordings.For a long time, the only thing you didn't have access to over CableCard was OnDemand content

 You had to navigate to the Website using your PC, and you simply couldn't use it with Xbox
 Just recently, however, Comcast released an XFinity OnDemand App as a free download in the XBox Marketplace, so now all you have to do is leave the Windows Media Center interface and head back to your dashboard to get OnDemand content
 I'm not sure if this requires an XBox Live Gold membership (and it's associated $80ish dollar annual fee) or not, as I am a subscriber anyway
 It may


 But having XFinity OnDemand, Netflix, HBOGo, and Hulu apps functioning on a device that also has access to all of your TV recordings and can pause-rewind live TV is pretty killer.And your recordings are now being made on to YOUR equipment

 So you have full control over their health and well-being


 With the use of some basic PC-healthy software, you will find that your hardware is far more reliable than the garbage set top boxes that the cable company provides, which seem to break down and need to be exchanged every 12-24 (if your lucky) months.And finally, I want to mention Ceton Customer Support


 I haven't had any problems with my Ceton product


 I have, however, had a problem with Comcast supporting the CableCard that my Ceton needs in order to work properly

 Although the problem had nothing to do with Ceton's product, Ceton's support team took ownership of their problem

 They could not have been more helpful trying to troubleshoot the problem with me, and when that failed, they actually dealt with Comcast on my behalf


 And got results
 Comcast eventually fixed the problem
 Because of Ceton's support team

 In this day and age, customer support like that is almost unheard of.I think it's a pretty awesome device

 And while you don't have to customize/tinker, as the product is ready-to-use almost right out of the box, if you do like to customize/tinker, opportunities are almost endless in the Windows Media Center environment


 Microsoft would be a fool to abandon this software
 Just because it hasn't caught on yet with the masses doesn't mean it's not awesome

 This is something Microsoft has that Apple/Google cannot (or at least haven't yet) matched
 They need to embrace WMC
 Have their new Surface Tablet play nice with it
 The possibilities/potential would be grand
 Hopefully they seize on those and do something extraordinary with it.As for the Ceton InfiniTV 4, I could hardly recommend this product more


 4-tv-tuners for the low-low monthly price of only one CableCard makes this a great way to reduce your monthly bill.

$review_text.: I bought one a long time ago at a big-box store and its still going.  I use that one at work.  I was so glad to find a good deal on a "used" one here on amazon for home since I've never had a mouse last 4+ years with only a single problem (the battery).  Its great sized compared to a majority of mice that seem to be made for people with "8 year old's hands".  Plus the weight is perfect as I used to take apart other mice and put model train weights inside to get the heft right to be accurate or, if a corded mouse, to prevent the thing from moving slightly on its own because of the cord pulling on it.  Microsoft's ergo team hit the nail on the head with this mouse, period.The problem:The rechargeable battery system included is weak at best.  It only took about 4-6 months for me to ditch that at work (battery wouldn't last a full day after >14 hours charging).  A regular AA battery lasts about 9 weeks and I found a deal on Amazon about 3 years ago for 150 Duracell AA for next to nothing that has been feeding it since (and for a while longer too).I suspect that the charger they picked was cheap and low enough power to work safely with the exposed terminals of the charge pad, but its just not powerful enough to keep a NiMH happy for a long time in the short use and low draw application they put it in.

$REVIEW.: I looked for a mid-priced receiver and this this is a good one. Easy to set up. Easy to operate. It does not have a lot of power, which I did not need. It drives my small Bose speakers quite well. I like the ease at which you can switch inputs and there are plenty for every device I have. I use this receiver as hub of my entertainment system, running TV sound, DVD, Satellite, etc. through it, with picture output to the TV.

$REVIEW.: The software is a little buggy, but it can be worked around.  One of the issues is that if I launch a full screen program, like a video game, while this is recording then the recording gets interrupted.  When you launch the full screen program it will basically start the recording over.  So if you're 45 mins into recording something the file once complete will only have from that 45 min point on.  I work around this by having the programs I launch while recording not use the full screen mode.  This works fine.  Sometimes occasionally the included software will lock up and I have to kill the processes and unplug the adapter and plug it back it.  This will reset the issue.  Also it appears to have a button ontop, but it is not.  When I first got it I pressed the "button" and the plastic piece broke off and now rattles around inside.  This has not affected its performance.
$SUMMARY.: Works to record VHS.

$review_text.: A great product that works as described.After flashing the SSD firmware from a bootable CD, putting a 120gb SanDisk Extreme in a (Dell GX620 sff/3ghz Pentium Dual Core w/2gb of RAM) was a walk in the park and so was installing Linux Mint 13 Cinnamon on the SSD.  Enabling the Trim function as described on various Mint/Ubuntu websites went without a hitch.  I've enabled a few other basic tweaks and they also have worked without any problems. Be sure to use the the EXT4 file system when partitioning, Linux Mint 13 uses it by default.  Do not use the Linux Mint 13 KDE release, not even Orkin could kill all the bugs on that turkey.At this point I am using the swap partition and browser caching on the SSD, but will be moving those to RAM as soon as Amazon gets my memory delivered to bump my computer up to 4gb.  A note to other Dell GX620 owners.  The Normal mode in the BIOS is in fact AHCI mode, as such it does fully support the Trim function.  Linux can also emulate the Trim function using CRON if you do not have an AHCI capable box.I'm telling you all this because getting the information to determine whether an SSD would work on my computer was like pulling teeth. User Name "SpeedStep" on the Dell forums was a lot of help.Buy an SSD, you'll like it.  Unless your Mac or an XP user, it isn't that big a deal.

$REVIEW.: A truly dangerous defect that is pervasive with ONLY the 16gb and 64gb versions- a large quantity  of these spontaneously become write-protected after awhile (days to months) and often you can't even read from it to recover your data!Patriot states there is no low level reformat tool to correct this internal setting. They simply  recommend RMA (return to manufacturer), with subsequent loss of your files!After this happened, I googled and found numerous complaints (Patriot forums, New egg) about this failure and loss of files.

I never have to worry about forgetting something - I just throw the whole thing into my ski duffle and know that I'll have everything I need to shoot, carefully organized


I keep all the parts of a GoPro 3 Black kit in here, plus an extra battery and some extra mount types.I only have two minor quibbles: Given that all the GoPro mounting parts are black, it would have been great if the interior of this was any other color
Also, some of the smaller part holes don't seem to map to anything that came with my GoPro 3 - maybe they're for the older models.

$REVIEW.: This may seem a bit foolish, but be sure you know what this device is and is not. This device is strictly for RAID storage, not for hot swapping.You CAN mount drives on their own, but do so very carefully. Follow the instruction booklet to the T. If you mistakenly engage the RAID hardware in the device, it will wipe and partition the devices.Now, getting on with the review assuming you know what you are doing:-The door on the outside is flimsy and likes to pop off. This is not a huge issue to me, as I have the device sitting in one location and doing its thing out of the way of the rest of my rig.-With my particular setup, the motherboard likes to be fickle and occasionally not post when this device is plugged in. This may be a non-issue, depending on your setup.-The power cord on the side that has been mentioned in the past is indeed annoying, and becomes increasingly so as you take down and put up your rig. If this happens regularly (LAN parties, etc) you may want to seriously consider where the box is going to sit to keep that cord out of the way.Overall read/write speeds have been fine with the RAID (4 WD 2tb Green Drives) and I have not had any major issues apart from the flimsy door, which now has been removed as it kept falling open.

$review_text.: This thing is a must have for anyone who owns a tablet.  Life just gets that much easier.  Who'd have thought such a simple thing would make such a difference.  First off, I love how heavy this thing is.  The weight helps make it usable on any surface...including a bed, which is where I most often am reading or watching videos on my tablet.  I have a couple 7" tablets which I've used with this and it works perfectly to hold it vertically or horizontally.  My friend has a 10" widescreen tablet and propped it up vertically and it holds it pretty securely as well (although I wouldn't try doing so on a non-stable surface such as a bed).  And the ability to lay the tablet down flat on it so it props it up only slightly is also great for playing games.  Overall I use this little guy pretty much all the time  I'm using my tablets.  Can't remember my tablet life before it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased my Time Capsule a little over a month ago after having my hard drive go on my 6 month old lap top and loosing a lot of my work & photo's, and having to reinstall all my programs again.  It was a ruff way to learn a lesson about backing up but I did.  I checked into a lot of different hd's but keep going back to the Time Capsule.  I read some of the neg reviews but after talking with a few people I know that own them and haven't had a problem I decided to get one.  Hook-up was a breeze, to make the first back up on my computer and my wife's computer go a lot faster I hard wired it. (a few hours vs overnight) After that I put the Time Capsule in another room shut the door and Time Machine makes wireless back up's in the back ground all day long.  It's so fast, if I didn't keep checking I'd never know it was working.  I'd recommend the Time Capsule to anyone, I have an Apple Power Mac so I can't speak to anyone on how it will work with a pc.  If anything changes I'll update this review but for me it was one of the best purchases I've made for my computer.

$review_text.: I have been using the Syba SuperSpeed Hub with my Windows 7 64 bit laptop for a month and have been pleased with the hub
 I have found I can use the hub without needing to plug in the included power cord for most devices with the exception of 2.5 inch hard drives which use two USB plugs

 These hard drives apparently demand more power and would not work without the additional power supplied to the hub.All four of the USB ports on my hub work perfectly with any of the devices that I have plugged into the hub including mice, keyboards, hard drives and other devices.What I have found is that Windows 7 will not give a warning when the hub itself is plugged into a USB 2 port


 It was only when I plugged into the hub a USB 3.0 device that my computer gave a warning that the device would perform faster if plugged into a USB 3.0 port.A downside to the Syba SuperSpeed Hub is the piercingly bright blue power light
 It certainly could have been toned down a bit
 I would also have liked to have seen another indicator light to warn when too much power was being demanded so that the user knew to plug the hub into the power supply as would be the case if a drive was plugged into the hub
 A third light to indicate when the hub was plugged into the power supply rather than running off of the USB connection would also have been a nice feature.Overall, a good, no frills powered USB 3.0 hub

 It is plug and play and does exactly as advertised.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update September 11, 2012 - The USB hub is now dropping the connection to my devices whenever I bump the cable between the hub and my laptop

 Usually I will hear the Windows chime that advises that a device has disconnected from the computer and it is just a matter of unplugging the USB cable to the hub and then plugging it back in to get my devices working again


 However, sometimes the devices are not recognized by Windows on the first try
 When I try to use my external hard drive through the hub while the hub is powered, the computer has trouble maintaining a connection to the hub.My original review was for 4 stars because the hub worked flawlessly and did so for over a year
 But, it just didnt last and I am now looking for a replacement hub
 Therefore, I have reduced my rating to 2 stars since it really should have lasted for longer than this.

$REVIEW.: I only used this once for a week of travel


But in 50 hours of driving, this car charge did what it was supposed to do
There is only one USB port that will charge an iPad, so you have to make sure you plug into the right port.PROS:* compact size fit easily into tight spaces.* 2 USB ports will keep to busy iPhones charged and running.* Build quality seemed good.CONS:* You can only charge one iPad at a time.* USB cord fit wasn't the tightest
While the USB cord never fell out on it's own, it was easily yanked

Your mileage may vary depending on the cord


This was not an issue that kept me from keeping phones charged.Test with iPad 2 and iPhone 4S

Both where charged successfully while using them, including mapping and continuous music playback.TIP: Rental car users, make sure the 12 Volt socket works before taking your rental car
 I've had problem with that before, and if you are taking a long trip, then it sucks to not be able to charge a phone.

$REVIEW.: I have been using my Olympus SP-320 for more than 6 monthes, and I am very satisfied with its performance.If you are looking for an easy to use, compact, high resolution digital camera with advanced features then Olympus SP-320 is the best choice for you.  With 30 shooting modes plus the option of using manual settings for more creative control, the SP-320 is a highly flexible camera.No doubt, the Olympus SP-320 is powerful enough for the advanced user yet simple enough for a beginner to capture incredible images. In addition, the Olympus SP-320 is a good choice for someone looking for a camera with advanced features, but who is on a tight budget.The Olympus SP-320 and the Olympus SP-310 are similar in being compact, rich in features; the only difference between the two is the digital image stabilization available on the Olympus SP-320. The Digital Image Stabilization Mode is very useful in capturing crisp, clear pictures--free from the blur sometimes caused by camera shake or moving subjects.The 3x optical zoom lens on the SP-320 has a focal length range of 8mm -- 24mm (35mm equivalent of 38mm -- 114 mm).The Olympus SP-320 is powered by 2 AA batteries, which makes it very easy to replace any time any where.The SP-320 has also a range of amazing optional accessories, including lens converters and an underwater casing.
$review_summary.: I love my Olympus SP-320 Digital Camera.

$REVIEW.: Started out being a great little camera....Then after owning it a few months, the left side of the LCD Screen became cloudy width vertical lines in it making it impossible to view the menu or function properly
It was still well before the warranty ended, so I sent it back to the factory

I waited three weeks and heard nothing so I phoned the Nikon repair department and was informed that I must have dropped it, therefore it wasn't covered

This was totally WRONG
I was taking a picture as this happened & I always carry it in a cushioned case
So to make a long story short....they ripped me off for $107.46 on a LCD repair that was defective!!!CANON will be my choice of cameras in the future!!!

$REVIEW.: After resisting buying this lens for a long time, I finally caved in after the canon 50mm f/1.8 or 1.4 was too limiting on my rebel XT. I haven't regretted the purchase. It is a tad soft at f/1.4, but not unbearable as long as you don't pixel peep (the 50mm f/1.4 was definitely sharper). My first copy was sharp with no front focusing issues. So I cannot attest to the quality issues of Sigma.I use this lens exclusively in the 1.4-2.0 range as I have the excellent Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 for breathtaking shots f/2.8 and above. I only use the center focusing point on my Rebel XT and it hasn't given me any focus problems, though it is difficult to confirm the focusing using rebel xt's small viewfinder. With a thin DOF there is plenty of margin for errors, but I have managed to focus accurately most of the time. After an initial auto focus, I use the manual focus to check my focus.The only thing ugly about the images it produces is the bokeh. It produces a wierd rounded triangular bokeh, as though one side of a circle was smashed in. Never seen anything like that before. But the quality of the images is otherwise very good and well saturated and I am willing to live with the bokeh. Others may not be so forgiving.The build quality is nothing big to brag about. It has a black matte finish which seems delicate and susceptible easily to scratches or dust sticking to it. Otherwise, it feels solid and as heavy as canon L primes.With the cost of this lens, and the Tamron 17-50mm lens, I have essentially committed myself to crop cameras. It has been my experience that, for the sub 500$ lenses, crop lenses often more useful, have much better color and sharpness than any full frame lens in the same price range with some notable exceptions like the canon 50mm f/1.4 & f/1.8.

$REVIEW.: I got this camera because it was on sale, a good bargain for a 12 MP camera. I have a Samsung 52" LCD HD TV that I am so happy about and love a lot. The price was much less than the competition from Sony or Mitsubishi on the TV I felt like I got a real value and thought I would trust Samsung again because I knew what they are capable of.The SL620 is a nice form factor, fits in my pocket and comes out ready for action quickly. It has the 12.2 Megapixels and 5x zoom, really astonishing technical achievements in a great package.There are some things that I do not like about this camera that might have been deal breakers had I known about it before my purchase.I really do not like the proprietary USB port and cable. Every time I go to hook this up to charge it or download the mini-hdmi (what it looks like) connector does not want to connect. It is hard to see whether it is up or down because it is so small. This is really irritating, and I am sure would be expensive if I ever lost or damaged the cable. A big thumbs down for that. I have gotten used to a standard mini-USB cable, but Samsung uses this one port for download, charging, and displaying to TV as well which probably saves money and parts - for them, but it does nothing to make the camera easier or better to use.Second thing is that I love the on-screen help, but when you flick between modes the text is on the screen not even fast enough to read - very frustrating. You have to keep clicking away and back to read the help screens? Maybe there is a setting to adjust this, but learning the camera becomes harder, and when they do not implement the help well, it is worse than no help at all because it is just a distraction.Next is the viewfinder. I have found that I have to be very conservative, ie. move back and try to give extra margin around my subject to shoot because what I see on the viewfinder is not necessarily the picture I end up with. I have not really analyzed this to find out exactly where the picture is or how it changes with modes, but one needs to see on the viewscreen exactly what the picture is, otherwise the viewscreen is useless too.I wish I could post some video I shot on this camera, the subject is off to the top of the frame, and even cut off.  When I was shooting it it was all in the center of the viewscreen.  This is a major problem ... I wish I could take it back at this point.The pictures are so huge that taking the picture seems to take a while before the camera comes back. The "snappiness" of the response leaves a bit to be desired.I also do not like the way the zoom is implemented as a vertical rocker switch up near the top of the trigger. Your thumb wants to move right and left if you hold the camera like a normal human being, and making it go up and down really makes the zoom clumsy to use, and makes the camera more likely to shake.As I said, I like the form factor, the detail is wonderful, the size and shape are great. The picture quality is very good. The screen help idea is great, and the text that comes up when you change modes is a good idea, but as I said you can hardly read it before it goes away leaving it just as hard to tell what mode you are in as the cameras that have no such help.I have to say I am disappointed overall in the design details of this camera, though all the parts are there and the picture is nice and very detailed an the zoom power is very good.The video is sharp and clear and very nice. I cannot say for sure but I think the image is stabilized in the video.I would recommend this camera for those who want all the features of a 12 MP 5x optical zoom for an inexpensive price and do not mind overlooking some ... what I think of anyway ... as bad design judgements. With proper tweaking this camera could have been so much much better.I wonder if Samsung can make a firmware upgrade or something to fix some of my gripes ... though I have never heard of a f/w upgrade for a camera.

$review_text.: OK, Here's the deal... This is just a mini laptop. It has Windows 7, 4GB of memory, 500GB Hard Drive, and a really decent processor. So... it's just like the big laptops. Well sorta.After using Windows Easy Transfer to load ALL my "stuff" from my larger laptop to my new Acer, I started playing around with it. After downloading Firefox, surfing the Internet on WI-FI was a breeze. TV Shows or "streaming video" quality from Hulu was freaking excellent! No problems at all.WELL...There was ONE problem. The speakers / sound level. They really dropped the ball on this. I can barely hear anything at full volume. It's OK to work with, but for playing music or watching movies? No way.However...Plug in some quality ear buds, like those from Skull Candy, and it sounds like a freaking "surround sound system" is installed! Truly awesome quality sound.Too bad ear buds or headphones are required, otherwise I would have given a full 5 Stars for this Acer.I bought this Netbook to take with me overseas and I believe it will work out just fine... as long as I don't lose my ear buds!Definitely would buy again despite the low volume.

$REVIEW.: The last GPS I got I couldn't even figure out how to turn on...they have really come a long way as far as ease-of-use.  This one...opened the box, easily assembled it onto the base with no directions, plugged it in, turned it on (okay, I had to go to directions for that, but they are very clear), followed all the steps (very intuitive - it walks you through it) and there I was - it had me pinpointed to my exact position in the parking lot - wow.  So I plugged in an address, and yes, I'm old-school - I was shocked with this relatively inexpensive machine started TAlKING to me, nice voice too - very clear directions, tells you exactly how far to go before turning.  This is the new model, which is why I got it, but it seems to have all the best features discussed in reviews of older models (I read a lot of reviews).  Again, I'm not proficient in technology (my 11 year old niece has to help me with my phone and forget an I-Pod) but from my point of view this has all that a typical driver would need - I even think my even less-technically proficient parents would like it and I plan to try it out on them.Update after a week: The screen shows several things I hadn't noticed, like your speed, the speed limit for the road you are on (some roads, not all roads), the expected time that you will get to the destination, the direction (North, South, East, West) and how far it is in miles. It's not distracting, as these notations are on the perimeter. The voice directions are very good, a warning prior to coming to a turn and then a 'turn left on ____ St.' when you get there and how far it is, as in 'turn left in point-three miles'. And it tells you which side of the street (left or right) your final destination is on, which is very helpful on a busy street.Also nice is the 'Map' feature: It's simply a map of where you are, showing an automobile icon that moves as you go along...it shows landmarks, street names along with the speed limit and your speed so you don't have to look down at the speedometer and guess if you're going the speed limit and what it is. This can be used even when you don't have a destination plugged in. Plus, the machine saves addresses so you just have to tap on an address from a list of places you've been, instead of retyping it. It also saves the cities, so you can pull it down from a menu instead of typing it in...so I would consider it generally 'user-friendly'.I got the portable Garmin Friction Mount to hold it in place (it's a beanbag type thing) which is really great, as you can easily stow it on the floor so no one decides to 'borrow it' if they see it on the dashboard.  Overall, couldn't be more pleased...this one doesn't have 'traffic alerts', so if you want 'traffic' there is another Garmin model that would be more suitable.

Even when you are not even touching the mouse, the pointer jiggles around. not good at all.Didn't worth the cost of the return shipping.

$REVIEW.: For background info, this is the very first time I ever give a 1 star rating to anything I bought on Amazon...I bought these screen protectors for my iPod Touch 2G
This is not the first screen protector I've used, so I know it can be tricky, but really these did not work for me at all
I had an issue with the first one where a spec of dust got trapped underneath, not the fault of the protector obviously, but I did notice that the rest of the protector did not look very good either, no air bubble, but just a lot of areas with either imperfection in the plastic itself, or a too large quantity of adhesive that creates dark spots all over the place
Because of the dust spec, I removed the protector, which left a lot of adhesive residue on the screen which had been on for only 24 hours by then

I used rubbing alcohol to get rid of the glue, that was not too bad
I then used a 2nd protector, hoping for better results

This time, no dust or hair got trapped underneath, no air bubbles either

But still it is covered with spot or defects


Again, I think there is just too much glue

I then had the iPod in my pants pocket (with nothing else in it) for just 4-5 hours, and when I took it out, the entire surface of the protector is scratched
It looks awful when the iPod is turned off and you can still see most of the defects when turned on


And I expect it will only get worse as time goes by.So, I have 3 more of them left, so tonight, I'll try again (and again, and again if needed...)

But for now, I would strongly recommend to stay away from this item, I had better luck with this one in the past:[...] and plan on ordering them again if none of the other ones work
Good thing they are cheap!

$review_text.: The first thing you'll notice is that it is big.  In fact, I was afraid there would be issues with case crowding or interference with other components.I installed this cooler on an Asus M32N SLI WiFi (Nvidia 590) motherboard with a newly added Phenom 9850.  I opted to replace the Cooler Master (that also worked well) on my old X2 5200+ chip since it was already 2+ years old.  It also let me evaluate the Zalman.I had two concerns when I opened the box: clearance for my newly added Corsair Dominator (1066) RAM that has a very high profile due and the weight.  To my great relief, it fits perfectly.  The jury is still out on the weight and I presently have my tower case laying horizontal until I work up the nerve to stand it up.  The installation bar is sturdy but I will reiterate: the unit is heavy and without question I will remove it before moving the system any large distance.Finally, I couldn't be more pleased with the results.  The stock Black Box AMD heat sink / fan is so loud it makes my office sound like an airport (that has been my experience with all AMD stock fans).  The system with AMD stock fan with no over-clocking caused CPU temperatures in the 59 to 61 Celsius range.  The new Z9500 AM2 dropped the temperature 10%: my system is running at 55 degrees with the fan speed set in the middle range.  Nice.There are less expensive options, for example CoolerMaster products that I know work great with very low fan noise.  But given the temperature drop and silent fan options, you can't go wrong with the Zalman 9500 AM2.

$review_text.: The Gigabyte A75M-UD2H with the AMD A8-3850 APU Quad-Core Processor is a very nice combo for a home theater system.  The positive about this setup is the ability to have fast CPU and a med range graphics card without having the additional heat and airflow issues.  I am going to review both the motherboard and CPU here because you really can't have one without the other.Windows 7 Performance Information: Processor 7.3, Memory 7.4, Graphics 5.9, Gaming Graphics 6.6, HD 7.6.Pro's:-- Fastest motherboard post time I have ever owned.  15 Seconds from the time I hit the power button till the time I see the Windows boot screen.-- There is a 5 of SATA 3 (6 Gb ports  + one external SATA 3 eSATA)-- Top mount SATA ports (rather than on the side of the MB).  This makes it easier for tight fitting micro cases.-- Easy BIOS upgrade software in Windows makes life easy.-- Six USB ports on the back (only two are USB 3 though)Con's:-- There is no way to default the video to HDMI.  The problem with this is if I don't turn on my TV and receiver first when it boots and doesn't see a video device it defaults to something else (probably DVI).  I can't get the motherboard to go back to HDMI without powering it down and restarting it.-- Only has 1 case fan connector on the mother board.  This really stinks being I have three case fans.-- Only gets a 5.9 on the graphics card score in Windows 7.  Lowest stat by far in my system)Notes:-- When the system boots it sees my 8GB's ram.

$REVIEW.: In-ear "headphones" are kind of a personal fit.  I imagine that ears and heads are shaped and sized differently enough that some people would hate how these fit since the business end is hard (but smooth) plastic, not foam or whatever soft material.  For me, they fit my ears perfectly.  They are very comfortable since I barely feel them when I wear them.  The over-ear portion fits under my glasses, keeping them snugly in my ears.  I can hear sounds around me well enough while wearing these, yet they supply nice, full sound.  The cord length is good (longer than average I would say).  For the price, they are a very nice set to have for walking or bike riding or other activities where you want something light that won't fall out of your ears as you move around.I would consider these 2 or 3 times better than the JVC Marshmallow, Gummies, and Ipod ear buds that I have bought my kids over the last couple of years, and they cost less.

$review_text.: Pros:=====+ Great Blu-Ray picture+ Netflix support+ Recent firmware updates (despite Samsung, according to Cnet, having a reputation of poor firmware support)+ Amazing audio support+ Blu-Ray 2.0 compliant+ Well designed menus and clear manualCons:=====+ Slow load time (gets more annoying the more movies you watch)+ Horrible format support for non-Blu-Ray discs.  This device can't even play MP3s or JPG photo-discs.  Are you KIDDING?!+ Awkward remote control button placement with no back-lighted buttons.+ Stupid audio CD playback where you can't even use the numbers on the remote to select which track you want.Okay folks, if all you want is a great Blu-Ray player that can handle multiple older formats of discs, you probably want to go with the Panasonic series given editors choice award on CNet.  However, if you love Netflix like I do, then this seemed/seems like a great option.  Sadly, it seems Samsung has cut a lot of corners in the non-Blu-Ray department to get this model out.The Blu-Ray picture is excellent in the Samsung, but they stumble greatly in giving us features we are accustom too.  It is really odd to see a product excel in one area and be so sub-par in another.  This frustrates me greatly because now I have to keep my old DVD player around to play photo CDs, MP3s, and finally DVD-Rs that my computer can burn.  Samsung never promised to support these formats, but they really should in this day and age.  My only hope is that Samsung will offer a firmware update that will address my complaints but there is nothing on the radar indicating that they'll do this.  Otherwise I will have to buy a new Blu-Ray player in about 1-2 years, and this is partially why I dropped the rating down to 3 stars.The player does a very good job at playing/upconverting DVDs.  I had to turn off the auto-DVD correction however as it was making the picture worse in my opinion.  CNet claims that the Oppo player is only a hair better than Samsung in this department, but no one notices a hair's difference in audio/video.  In other words, the Oppo is really 10-15% better in up converting DVDs in my personal comparison.I also recommend turning down/off the sharpness otherwise you'll find bad transfer/compression artifacts magnified.  This was very evident in Black Hawk Down (Blu-Ray version) where mosquito noise in the sky shots were more visible with the sharpness on high.  Although people rave about Black Hawk Down, it was done in MPEG-2 which I think may lead to skeeter noise, and no fault of Samsung.  I still need to test this player with movies that is using better encoders besides animated movies like Kung Fu Panda and Cars, which were amazingly clear on this player.Finally, a little tip for those doing USB firmware updates... (1) make sure you download the USB update instead of the CD update per the instructions on Samsung's site, (2) unzip the file and place it at the root of the USB drive, and (3) plug in the USB drive after you booted up to the main screen instead of having the drive plugged in before powering on.  That's when it finally worked for me.

 I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase

 It's a great camera for going out and I have no problem taking pics in a dark bar/club

 I've even been able to get decent hand-held pics at sporting events

 You may get red eye in close group shots, but that's to be expected with the flash placed so closly to the lense
 Anybody who says this camera doesn't take good pics does NOT know how to use a camera...The Auto setting is very user friendly and you should be ale to figure out the proper manual settings if you read the instructions.

I wanted a quality mp3 player that didnt cost tons of money (like all the stuff that begins with the letter "I")
This Sansa fit the bill perfectly
It's so easy to hook up to my computer to download the mp3s, the computer charges it as its hooked up (it doesnt take regular batteries - the battery is built in and recharges itself, which is a great feature)

Then, I take it with me in my car and use this cool little Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter and Auto Charger (separate purchase on Amazon -Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for Sansa) to listen in my car


I also bought an extra (separate purchase on Amazon -SanDisk 8GB microSDHC Card CLASS 2 (SDSDQ-8192, Bulk Package)) because I had so many music files to add

I havent had a chance yet to use the video or image features, so I cant comment on those


All in all, I am 100% happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this item.

$REVIEW.: Everything about these headphones shouts quality

 Most importantly, they have an amazingly clear sound

 The audiophile term is transparent; they add nothing and take away very little

 With an accurate, live recording, what you hear from them is what you would hear if you were there.One aspect I particularly appreciate, and others may love them or hate them for this, is the accuracy of their bass response

Some less expensive headphones, and even a few more expensive ones, are designed to "punch" the lower end, sometimes by unnatural amounts.For example, one recording I use while evaluating headphones is of a heartbeat
 It's a great source for low frequency, low volume, non-steady sounds
 Some lower end headphones I have manage to turn these soft, subtle sounds into what you would expect from a bass drum
 I have higher end headphones that don't distort the volume so much but still don't get a sound that is natural

 These manage to get everything right
 That accuracy extends across the spectrum.As to the other aspects of these headphones:* The cord is over four feet long and tangle free.* The audio/phone control buttons are easy to feel and provide good feedback when pressed.* Callers had no problem l hearing me when I used the microphone.* Siri had no trouble understanding me when I used voice commands.* This is the best fit I've had with ear gels of this type
 (More on this later)* The packaging is also appropriately high quality

 This is important if you are giving this as a gift.So how, you ask, did I improve these headphones for a few dollars?  The problem is I have never been able to use the round, press-in ear gels that are included with these headphones


 Thanks to the variety of gels Denon provided, I got a good fit


 However, good as it was, I wanted better because these are headphones I will want to use.In the past, I've had to rely on custom-made ear gels
 In this case, by "go-to" store bought gels, theEtymotic Research ER38-18 3-Flange Eartipsfit perfectly
 The bad news is, due to the right angle bend in each ear piece, they wouldn't fit far enough into my ears with the cords hanging down
 The good news is they fit remarkably well by pointing the cord upward and looping it over each ear


 (If you haven't tried it, you should
 It makes many headphones more wearable.)  Worn in this manner, they provide the outstanding audio quality already described, block out a considerable amount of outside noise, fit securely, and are absolutely the most comfortable headphones I own.


$SUMMARY.: Outstanding Headphones!  I made them outstandinger for less than $3.

Quiet frequently I have a pretty bad lag when when streaming movies and playing games on Xbox live

Even on the PC, which is connected directly to the Fios modem

The instructions were simple, the process took me about 7 minutes
I noticed a few other Fios user's review and they had to contact Media Link for assistance

That was not needed for me


The router came with two sets of instructions, one for DSL users, and one for "ALL USERS, EXPECT USERS WITH A DSL MODEM&" I used the instructions for all users since Fios is not DSL


Easy peasy baby.FUDGE CAKES! I just tested my speeds again
Average on my pc is now....

$review_text.: I bought a Pentax K-30 for my more rugged outdoor photography sessions.  I don't typically need a flash, so I leave the GPS unit attached all the time.  My camera still fits into my LowePro 100 Slingbag (with no extended camera battery attached).  HEre is a quick review of the O-GPS1COMPATIBILITYI use it on a Pentax K-30.  The K-30 does in fact support the Astrotracer feature on the GPS.  The GPS menu on the K-30 is easy to access and use.FORM FACTOR and AESTHETICSThe O-GPS1 has a fairly tight form factor.  It adds about 2" to the top of the camera.  It does take over your hot shoe and will block the built-in flash. The GPS unit itself is about 2"x2" square.  It looks great on the camera. And has not been getting in my way at all.FUNCTIONALITYAs I mentioned, the Astrotracer feature does indeed work on the K-30.  I have used this feature a couple of times and it has been great.  This feature allows you to manually focus on a celestial object (not planets, though) and the mirror will adjust so that the exposure follows the star, etc.  The main reason I bought the O=GPS1, though, is so that I can remember where in the world I took a shot.  The location comes over in the metadata and has worked with both Lightroom and Aperture without any hiccups.  The GPS on average has required a 3D satellite signal within about 90 seconds or less.  Location info has been very accurate.  You will need to recalibrate the GPS each time it dismounted (you do this by carefully turning the camera on each axis).  The metadata even indicates which direction you were facing when you took the shot.There is a built in compass as well as a trekking tool.  You could conceivably store the location of your car when you park if you are going for a photo shoot on a trail, but you would be better off with a dedicated GPS for that.  Still, it's an added feature and I'll take it!DURABILITYI haven't managed to drop the GPS (yet), but it has been subjected to dust, dew, wipe outs on the ski slope, and a sudden, brief downpour.  It will need to stand up to this and more based on my intended use of the K-30 its mounted on.  So far it has stood up to all of these tests, the biggest of which was my wipe out on the slopes where my camera and the GPS were totally covered in snow.RECOMMENDATIONReally, at this price point, I think the O-GPS1 is a great deal if you want location info included with your photos.  Accuracy and reception inside or in an urban area with tall buildings might be touchy, but if you're an outdoor shooter, the O-GPS1 is a great device.  And it seems to be a perfect match for the weather-sealed K-30.

$REVIEW.: This is the first time I have used a SSD on a personal system. When putting together my last upgrade for my computer, I was between getting one of these or getting 8 more gigs of RAM.I am so happy I chose the SSD.I did some research about SSDs and found that for its price, the Samsung EVO series was delivering quite an outstanding performance. I decided to give it a try and use it as my operating system drive, which obviously mean it is the drive which the computer uses to boot up.The difference from my old HDD is simply impressive. It takes but just a few seconds to have all my programs running. After the Windows logo, the screen goes from black to being completely populated by my 3 desktops (I am using 3 screens at the time) and all programs running in just a moment.I wished I could provide the difference in actual seconds, but it is simply impressive.I am extremely satisfied with this SSD and I am actually thinking on investing on another one for my most regular games and programs.I am sure I will never go back to a HDD for booting, it is just too big a difference.So, if you are like me, a person who is annoyed at having to wait for the computer to complete booting up, this is what you have been looking for.

$REVIEW.: This product arrived in great shape and is working as described.  Was in New condition.Camera is as good as it is reviewed, maybe even better for the price.  The optic zoom is very smooth and quiet, the photo quality rivals higher Mega Pixel cameras.  Most importantly for me, was the true clicking operation of the dial selector for features on top of the camera.  It truly clicks and holds on each selection, not like many smaller handhelds that glide through the features and any movement changes your selection.

$REVIEW.: Bought this after replacing internal SuperDrive in 2009 MB Pro with SSD (using OWC Data Doubler). Decided it wasn't worth buying a case for the internal for the same price and didn't see the point in buying the official external Apple SuperDrive for almost 3x the price when it is used so little. Drawer feels a little flimsy but otherwise works great. No drivers needed for either Mac or PC.

$REVIEW.: First and foremost, the battery compartment would not stay closed with a battery in it

Without a battery, it closes fine, but it's not very useful without a battery
I tried several batteries, rechargeables and alkalines
They were all just too big, or should I say the battery compartment was just poorly designed

The overall look and feel is cheap, I knew that getting into it
It's a $10 knockoff wireless mouse, I didn't have high hopes to begin with


The edges are poorly finished, the top coating didn't completely and evenly coat the top surface
It was just one thing after another, but I was willing to overlook those things
But I could not overlook the fact that sometimes when I picked up the mouse, the battery fell out

"Tape it up" some said, no


I'm not expecting a lot from this mouse, but for $10 I'd expect it to be able to hold onto a battery
When it was working on a flat surface and without having to pick it up, it was fine
For the money, I would have kept it


With a battery compartment that felt designed by Mrs Smiths 5th grade arts and crafts class, no.

$REVIEW.: While the advertising on Amazon says this is a Neewer product, it is actually made by Meike of China.  I'm sure they're one and the same company but it would be nice to have the correct manufacturer's name listed.I ordered this battery grip knowing it was designed for the D5100 and not the D3200 which I just purchased.  From photographs of both cameras the body style appears identical and they use the same battery, so for the price, it was worth the try.  I removed the battery door from the camera (which is nerve-wracking because I certainly didn't want to break it), inserted the battery grip onto the camera, inserted the Nikon battery and it works perfectly.As has been stated in other reviews, I wish the shutter release cable was attached differently, that the battery door didn't rattle and that the plastic was of higher quality.  At least it matches the camera body.The fit is excellent and it gives more "heft" to an otherwise light camera.  The feel of the battery pack and camera combo is very good.I just wish Nikon would make a battery grip for their lower end DSLRs.  I'd certainly buy it and rate it higher than a 3 I'm quite sure.The reason for the 3 rating is:1) Cheap plastic2) Cable for the shutter release on the battery pack is unhandy3) The rattle of the battery door (I'm sure that can be fixed but would prefer not to have to fix new equipment regardless of cost)I would recommend it to others with the above three reservations noted.

$REVIEW.: If you have UHF (All HD is now UHF) stations that are actually broadcasting between channels 15 and 40, this antenna will pull them in from behind many trees, full foliage, at 50 miles. UPDATE: Went the entire winter with great signal. I fine tuned the aim last weekend. I found out that I proper aim is right through a major main branch of the maple tree. But when I go out way in front of the house, and look down the station path to the antenna, there is half of the right side visible, and half of the left side visible. This means that even though the tree limb is 12" across, the TV signal is still hitting a major portion of this antenna. It is working avery well. I really loave this antenna. It replaced a Yagi. Much better reception.

$REVIEW.: This is a very good little transmitter.  The manufacturers sent me one to test and review, and I am very happy with it.The unit itself is compact (about 6cm x 2.5cm x 1cm), weighs just a few grammes and looks very neat.  It has a nifty fold-away 3.5mm jack plug which, when plugged into the output of my mp3 player, forms a tidy double unit with the player itself.In use, it has a full range of FM frequencies to transmit on so if you run into interference you can easily change frequencies, and a small but clear digital display of the frequency.  The reception on my car radio is excellent, with very clear sound and no distortion or hiss.  I've tried it on my living-room stereo, too and it's fine up to a range of well over 3 metres, meaning that I can play my mp3s through the stereo while having the player next to me on the sofa to control.  Again, the sound is very good.By turning up the volume on the mp3 player to nearly maximum, the level of sound coming from the radio is similar to other FM stations but it does mean you need to watch you don't forget to re-adjust and accidentally blow your head off next time you use the player with headphones.  (Guess how I found out...)  Just thought I'd warn you.I'm very pleased with this little unit.  It's neat, does the job very well and I can recommend it.

$review_text.: I just got this today along with the M510 wireless mouse

When I first plugged in the keyboard, it was recognized right away


I turned on the mouse but I couldn't get the mouse pointer to move


I checked the batteries and all seemed fine
Finally, after plugging my USB mouse back in, I went to the Logitech site and discovered there is "Unifying" software that has to be downloaded and installed

Once I did that, the mouse and keyboard worked fine from one USB bluetooth dongle.Overall, the keyboard is very nice
It's very thin yet very solid feeling

The key action is like the keys on my Macbook Air pretty much - a bit different than my old iMac keyboard that this is replacing but I like it


I do have a few slight gripes that together, make me subtract one star from a perfect rating.First, the function keys are setup like a Macbook in that the function keys do double duty
The F1 - F4 keys also do the screen brightness Up/Down, Expose, and Dashboard , F7 - F9 do media rewind, play/pause, and FFW, and F10 - F12 do Mute, Sound down, Sound Up


To use these, you have to hold down the Fn key (which replaces the Help key on the iMac keyboard (which I never used))
Not a big deal because you can remap the function keys in Sys Prefs anyway but something to note

I guess the only thing is the loss of dedicated Volume keys above the number pad like I had on the iMac keyboard.Next, as others have noted, the feet that raise the back of the keyboard up seem very flimsy

Hopefully, they won't break but I'm not holding my breath.Finally, it's not clearly shown in the photos but the black model has a white ring around the edge

The pictures on Amazon are taken against a white background so it's easy to miss but I was expecting an all black keyboard to somewhat match my case.Other than those gripes, I like it.

$REVIEW.: This is a very flexible IPAD and smartphone mount that fits snugly in any cup holder, as the base will push out and secure itself when you turn it.  I've used it with two cars,  a 2011 Mazda 6 and a 2013 Toyota Camry,  I found that the position of the cup holders makes a big difference.  The fact that the cup holders are a little further away in the Camry allow me to ideally position my IPAd for viewing (I like to use the APP &#34;Waze&#34; for navigation). My only quibble is that I wish the handle could telescope so that the positioning of the height of the IPAd was adjustable.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.

$review_text.: I bought this stand for use with my Ipad Mini Retina. The Apple case has too steep a viewing angle to really use on things like planes and this stand not only works with the case still attached, but also has enough different angles that I imagine it would work for a variety of surfaces. It also grips things like slippery tray tables quite nicely.When I travel, I have this in the same Skooba case as all of my cords and power warts and, although a little bulky, it folds up nicely. After reading other reviews about the robustness of the locking mechanism, I'm careful when opening or closing the stand but like the overall heft and build quality. There may be better stands out there, but this works well for me.

$REVIEW.: I have Verizon FIOS and replaced the FIOS DVR with a TIVO mainly because I wanted more recording options and the ability to offload and upload programming to and from my PC. I paid $25 for the Tivo Plus option to be able to connect to my PC.My Tivo HD has been very reliable for the past 24 months and it continues to be reliable even after I upgraded the internal hard drive to a bigger one. Never had a failure and only a couple of reboots, nothing serious.I was hoping that the Tivo works as well as my old Panasonic Showstopper ReplayTV DVR. Unfortunately that's not the case. The interface is VERY SLOW and on many screens such as Season Passes there are endless delays with the "PLEASE WAIT" message up on the screen for several minutes at a time. Very annoying.  On my old ReplayTV and on the FIOS DVR there were never any delays. Overall the interface is unpolished and it goes from SD mode to HD mode and back depending on what you do. Tivo really needs to get a lesson from Apple on a slick interface such as the AppleTV.  So this annoyance is really frustrating on a daily basis.Another annoyance was the installation and one subsequent failure of a cable card (this is not TiVo's fault). Unfortunately Verizon is not used to servicing Cable Cards and therefore it took repeated cable guy visits to finally get it set up.The last annoyance is the fact that the interface with the PC is not working properly. I'm unable to upload to the Tivo from my PC after Tivo updated their software. I can only download programs to my PC - a very slow procedure.So looking back at it, I regret getting the Tivo. I should've stuck with the Cable Co DVR. In the future I might switch to a home theater PC when they come up with a system that doesn't need cable cards.

$REVIEW.: These types of portable speakers are the best little speakers of the many cheap kinds we have tried.  The sound is loud and clear.  (They are INEXPENSIVE speakers, so keep that in mind - if you want awesome high quality sound, you won't get that in a $2 speaker!)We use these to boost the sound for movies on our laptop, and it is loud enough to hear even with a vacuum running not far away.  Since this has a standard plug that fits computers and many mp3 players, I also use this with my Sansa Fuze for audiobooks when I don't want to use headphones such as when I'm cooking.I like that this particular item (unlike other similar folding, portable speakers at the same price) comes with a usb plug so we don't have to use batteries (it takes 4 AAAs); we can power up from the laptop instead.  I also found a usb wall adapter to purchase online so I can plug that same usb cord into the adapter, and then into a regular wall outlet (I haven't received it yet so I can't comment on how that works).  Too bad the regular wall adapters for this cost more than the speakers themselves!We have 3 of these types of speakers, and plan to get another pair or two so we can have one in each bedroom, in the kitchen, and for the car (we are all big fans of audibooks!) At this price, absolutely worth it.The only thing I'll make sure of next time is which accessories are included, such as the usb power cord, because some sell for the same price or more for just the unit itself without any extra cords.

Some other after market cables will not fit. THIS IS THE CABLE TO BUY. The cable comes with a driver disk which is junk. Mine was blank. Throw this disk away and download the Prolific 3.2.0.0 driver for free online. Many Chinese manufactured cables come with a cloned chip in the USB plug and will not work with Windows using the standard Windows Driver. The PROLIFIC 3.2.0.0 driver will work perfectly. Baofeng has programming software for use with this cable but a free program called CHIRP is much batter and works with this cable and the Prolific 3.2.0.0 driver. The radio can also be programmed manually. It is 1,000, 000, 000 times easier to program this radio using this cable and the CHIRP software. This cable will not fit ICOM, VERTEX, YAESU, KENWOOD radio's. It fits Baofeng Radio's and some other Chinese manufactured radios.The PROLIFIC 3.2.0.0 driver and the CHIRP program are available free of charge at www dot miklor dot com. you will also find instructions on how to use the CHIRP software and how to install the PROLIFIC 3.2.0.0 driver. Again ... THIS IS THE CABLE TO BUY for BAOFENG RADIO's. You might find one cheaper but you are just buying trouble. BUY THIS CABLE. USE CHIRP. USE the PROLIFIC 3.2.0.0 driver with this cable!

I love that in the laptop compartment, there are many slots for CDS, papers, and space for the battery
On the outside (with a velco lock cover), underneath are more slots for putting memory cards, small papers, etc.This case is quite sturdy for the price about about $35


However, it's very annoying when you have to go navigate through tight spaces

The reason I purchased it was to specifically give me more movie expansion space for the iPad

First priority was to upgrade the firmware on the goflex which went off without a hitch
Second, was to download the ipad / iphone / touch apps for the goflex, which led me to the issue of only having the option to play MP4 movie files


So, since I also had the app oplayer installed, I would try running avi and my mkv files through that
Although they ran well enough, they just didn't run smoothly, and that also applies to the other so called players from the app store that play avi and mkv files


They play the files, just not smoothly enough

Since my ipad is jailbroken, I went in another direction
Installed XBMC on the ipad, connected to the goflex and I couldn't be any more happier with how XBMC plays all my media files
Super Smooth and full of tweaking audio and video features

Highly recommend going in that direction if you have a jailbroken ipad

500GB's of space will give you a pretty decent collection of avi, mp4 and mkv movie's and so far the battery life has held up to specs
Mp4 movie's through the goflex app will give you even more battery life because it buffers in a more efficient way, but XBMC is the still the way to go when wirelessly streaming XVID, AVI, MKV and even MP4 files because of the tweaking options in XBMC.I've also got no complaints when using the goflex with my iphone, touch and laptop


So far, it's been pretty stable, so if you are frustated by the limited space on the ipad, even having 64gb's to work with, a 500gb goflex satellite external wireless hard drive allows you to bring a nice collection of movie's and tv shows on the go that can keep you entertained while traveling.P.S The most efficient way to save battery life and still allow you to watch your avi mkv mp4 files perfectly smooth is a tip I came across which allows you to download your movie / TV file from the goflex to the ipad using oplayer, then you can open the oplayer folder with all your media files in it within XBMC

That way, instead of streaming the video file, which sucks battery life, you can just transfer the file from the goflex to the ipad


If it was, for example, a 700mb avi file, you can download it to your ipad in around 4 minutes, then turn the goflex off to save battery and just watch it directly on the ipad which saves battery life as well because you don't have the wi-fi running.If your ipad isn't jailbroken, you can still follow this procedure through the oplayer app, download the media file from the goflex directly to the ipad and play it through oplayer


It's just any media file, unless it's an mp4, doesn't run completely smooth in any of the apps on itunes that can play avi, mkv files, etc.

$REVIEW.: I give this cover only 3 stars because I expect more for something at this price

After stating that I will say that the cover is very beautiful


 It makes you feel like you are reading from an antique novel instead of an e-reader

 It is very eloquent looking
 The material was stated to have a leather look, I do not agree with that but it does have a kind of soft look

Regarding the straps that hold the Kindle Fire - I am not very confident in their ability to keep the Kindle in place so I handle with care
So far so good


 Also just for an FYI it does not stay close so I lay it down with the back facing up
 Overall I like the cover but will look for something more secure and probably have some sort of stand attached to it for times when I want to watch a movie or something.

$REVIEW.: For any subject/object requiring precise placement and framing a gear head is imperative, and this head is currently the best value in the market for 35mm camera users. Such subjects/objects include product, food, interior, architectural, and some portraits (location/life style). Other types of photography including landscape, sports, and events might benefit more from other types of heads such as ball heads or none at all.The Manfrotto 410 offers full control of each axis independently of the other axis. Hence, the head allows for rotation, and forward and side tilting. Each movement is essential for framing subjects/objects. For example, while photographing interiors achieving level placement is very important to maintaining none converging vertical lines. By having the ability to control forward tilt independently from side tilt, obtaining straight vertical lines becomes an easy task. Furthermore, while photographing food if the front lip of the plate appears too dominant tilting the camera slightly upward can easily correct the problem.The key phrase is slight or minor, because three way heads offer the same feature above but they do so with out the precise control. To make any of the adjustments above one has to loosen the lock for each control and make the adjustment by hand and then relock on the desired position. Such method is crude and cumbersome especially for fine adjustments required for product and interior photography. More so, the adjustment can slightly change which relocking the axis, rendering the adjustment useless.Unlike three way heads, the Manfrotto 410 has gears inside its housing to facilitate precise movements. Turn the knobs slightly and the head will move slightly in the desired direction. Keep turning and the head will continue until it completes the movement range. Admittedly, turning the knob to complete the full range of movement takes a while. For faster adjustments there are levers, when released, allow for free movement by hand exactly like a three way head.That means you get the best of the two heads, precise and free movement, plus much more including very small adjustment knobs compared to three way heads. Also, the quick release plate included with this head is bulky but very stable. The quick release adapter is built into the head making it impossible to change the quick release system. That is disappointing until you consider that Kirk makes an adapter that attaches directly to the quick release adapter and allows for use of Arca Swiss plates instead. It is quite pricey accessory but considering the cost of the head compared to other alternatives this combo comes out cheaper than buying another head with built in Arca Swiss quick release system.Fully recommend, buy with confidence!

$REVIEW.: The unit works fine. I play relatively little golf, but it has done everything I'd hoped for.Short Version- CALL the iGolf folks to get started. imo there's setup/registration is not that clear in the Getting Started/registration process.Long Version(s)MAJOR GOTCHA- Unit Name Distinction- This unit is a "Neo PLUS".  It is NOT  a 'Neo' .  Bushnell makes a Neo, and the web pages look very similar. Regardless, whether you are working with pages at Bushnell's site, or iGolf's site, be sure to specify Neo PLUS.  Do attempt to register, or download any sync apps, device apps, or manuals for the Neo.  Actually Neo+ syncing needs no app.  It's done right on your browser.MAJOR GOTCHA-  Don't lose that course you "manually mapped" !  If you manually "Map" a course into your Neo+, you can't send it to iGolf, but most important- DO NOT SYNC AGAIN, until you talk with iGolf.  Better yet- call iGolf and talk with them first.  It can be done, but you'll need their help.MINOR GOTCHAs- At the iGolf site, remember your registration is already paid for.  Be sure in snaps into the belt clip with an audible  "click".  I've had the unit fall out of the belt clip twice. But since listening for the "click" it's stayed put.Avoid those "hazards", and it's an excellent value.

$REVIEW.: This speaker is amazing! You have to understand that the sound quality can't be compared to a $250 speaker

Dialogue comes through clearly
It has a decent amount of bass to it, but not too much to sound muddy

The highs are clear


I like that it has a center tweeter and two 5.25 inch woofers on either side
I think it sounds very balanced
The only thing that I would caution you about is that this is no "space saving" speaker
It is fairly large: 6.7 x 15.8 wide x 8.5 inches ; 10.6 pounds

You definitely need a shelf or an older CRT TV to set it on
For the money, you can't go wrong with it


I would most definitely buy it again.

 It is small, compact and does what it needs to do
 I love that I can just put it in my computer bag and just go


 It doesn&#8217;t have excess software which means less clutter for my computer
 Not too expensive as far as burners are concerned

$REVIEW.: I have owned SX30 and SX40 cameras in the past. SX40 was a HUGE improvement over SX30. However, I am not sure that I see too much difference between SX40 and SX50. It is an AWESOME camera, dont get me wrong. However, if you are just an amateur photographer (like me) and you already own SX40, I would probably recommend keeping your SX40. New version allows you to shoot HD movies and has some minor differences in technical specs. However, I am just not sure if the prices difference between SX40 and SX50 justifies the difference in quality of the images. I think you should at least wait for the price to go down a bit before upgrading.If you DONT currently own SX40 and you are in a market for a new high-end point and shoot camera, then this is the camera for you. I keep all settings on Auto and I absolutely love the quality of the pictures.Its a really great camera for the money!

$review_text.: The invisibleshield name is a slight misnomer. It's not invisible. You can tell it's on your device. And that's a good thing all around.There is no color to the shield, but it has a somewhat greasy looking gloss to it. By greasy, I mean, it's not super reflective - so it's got great viewability in the sun. The skin also grips a lot better than any other skin I've seen - so it just sits in your hand with great stability  (like a rubber skin). At the same time though, finger strokes over the screen are smooth and don't stick.The key, however, is the scratch protection. After 9 months of getting tossed around in my book bag, the screen on my ipod touch looks the same as the day I applied the invisibleshield. The video clips and those crazy guys at the mall are not lying. this shield will take a beating and "heal" itself of any superficial slices/scratches whatever. Any other screen protector would resist small scratches, but hold onto the deeper ones - and gradually build up over time, until it needed to be replaced.BOTTOM LINE: The InvisibleShield comes with a lifetime warranty, but you won't use it. This screen protector will last for the life of your device. (And will make it easier to use the device too.)

$REVIEW.: Bought this Apple Magic Mouse as "used - like new" for about $45. It really looked mint new when received it. Apparently, the previous owner barely used it -- probably because the previous owner just wanted to continue using a regular double-button-with-the-middle-wheel mouse or probably wanted a nice gaming mouse. Well, that turned out to be good for me since have always liked the Apple Magic Mouse when having used it on another mac, but didn't want to spend the full $70 to get one. So, in the meanwhile have been happily using a cheapwired mouseuntil recently when all sorts of cables started cluttering up my work area where my Macbook resides most of the time. So, got the Apple Magic Mouse to get rid of the mouse cable. Oh, one thing that you will have to get used to is the lower profile of the Apple Magic Mouse since this mouse is not as tall as a regular mouse. Also, if you are used to doing the right click on a regular mouse, then you'll have to go into System Preferences, click  Mouse, and check the box for Secondary Click to get the right click to work. And while you're in there, you may want to increase the tracking speed also. And since you're in System Preferences, also go click into Bluetooth, click Advanced, and UNCHECK the box for "Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer" -- my thinking is that since can tap on the keyboard on my Macbook to wake it up then unchecking the wake-up setting will probably at least help a little bit to conserve the battery when the Apple Magic Mouse is asleep. There is also some software called MagicPrefs that other users have talked about, but these settings on the mac seem to be good enough for me at the moment. And so, this Apple Magic Mouse seems to be a good purchase and really looks like a cool device to have.

$REVIEW.: Ordered this headset on May 6 and thanks to Amazon Prime, they were on my doorstep May 8.Setup was a snap and I'm delighted that Sennheiser included an adaptor for connection to a 3.5 mm headphone socket


 Fits my flatscreen t.v


perfectly.Charged the headphones overnight and put them to the test today for the primary purpose of my purchase: being able to clearly hear my t.v


while using my treadmill - something I've been unable to do because the treadmill is pretty noisy.The headphones fit my head snugly and the sound is excellent
 Took but a moment to tune them to the t.v


and once the tuning and volume are set, there's no need to touch the controls again.They worked flawlessly during my 45 minute workout

 No hiss

 No static
 Thanks to the good fit, they even muffled the sounds of the treadmill.While I was walking, I wondered if I could connect them to my iPad

 Another perfect fit!  Now, that's really terrific since I can listen to my music while outdoors washing the car or maybe even mowing the grass!Great product from Sennheiser and great service (as usual) from Amazon!

$review_text.: This was very easy to unpack and set-up.  Only 4 narrow screws are used in attachment to the wall.  I mounted it on my apartment wall, and when I remove it it should be easy to fill the holes so I don't get charged by the management company for destroying the wall.  Take your time in leveling before you drill.  I was a little off and had to use an allan wrench on one side (under the top hook) to raise the side a bit.  The packaging could be a bit less wasteful if they were to fully disassemble the back plate before boxing.  I was confused why it was pre-assembled because the instructions called for having to assemble it from 4 pieces.The free HDMI cable is a great bonus.  Best buy charges like $50 for these, which can be had for $10 online.This project took 2 trips to home depot.  I needed 16 5/16" washers for attaching the arms to the back of the TV (the included hardware, while extensive, didn't fit my application perfectly...the included M8 screws were a little long).  I could have bought 4 new 20 mm M8 screws to replace the 25 mm M8 screws; however, they only had 3 at home depot so I elected to go with washers instead.  I had to go back a second time to pick up a second socket.  Beware the top and bottom mounting screws are different sizes!Great product.  Save yourself $200 by skipping best buy and getting this.

$REVIEW.: I am not too familiar with these types of gadgets, so for some reason I had expected this item to set up and work a bit differently from what actually happened.I had expected to: plug this into a relatively convenient outlet [one close to where my existing WiFi signal is weakest] and then when I turned it on it would connect to my existing WiFi (automatically or with simple command prompts on my computer) and then the extender's WiFi signal would "piggy back" off the existing WiFi signal and my WiFi range would be further increased to whatever distance this extender device would carry it.Instead, what happened was that I plugged it in an outlet (very close to my existing wireless router as instructed) and followed the instructions pertaining to the WPS connection (i.e., push the button on the range extender then push the button on the existing wireless router for a connection to take place) to a tee and nothing happened


Nothing! I had to make a hard connection to my computer via the very short (included) RJ45 cable, and set up the device as I would a regular wireless router; then plug it in an outlet not too far away from my existing wireless router.Now, essentially I have two different wireless networks


So when I am out of range of my existing wireless router's signal, I have to (manually) connect to the new one created by this so called range extender


It's kind of silly to me, because it's not what I had expected, but I suppose it's okay, as I can go about 5ft
further in my house than I could before and have a (second) WiFi network I can connect to :-/

$REVIEW.: I actually just bought my second version 2 Zune AC Adapter...I'll keep one in my car, and the other I'll keep in the house. The one for the car I'll use when I head to the shore and other places (like airline trips) that might not have available USB connections.Sure, Zune sells a car charger that I'd like to have, but as of this writing it is ridiculously priced at like at over 60 bucks, and I'm not plugging some knock-off into my car lighter only to risk blowing out the car's fuses. The Zune AC adapter is cheap, and even cheaper with some of Amazon's trusted (95% plus, multiple positive ratings) third party sellers (which is where I got both of mine). (For what it's worth, the 60 dollarv2 Zune Car Packalso will connect and let you broadcast your Zune music through your FM car stero, so that may actually be worth it for you if you can't connect your Zune to your car stereo via a high qualityCable).A full charge with the AC adapter takes just an hour or less. The prongs are retractable, which is good because I had similar AC adapters that I've traveled with that have broken off.The only real gripe I have is the greediness of Microsoft and Zune not including a sync cable with the AC adapter that is required to connect the adapter to the Zune. Of course I have the cable that came with the device, but it would have been nice to have a dedicated cable for the adapter. I'd have even preferred an adapter with the power cable permanently attached to the adapter.Now, you might be asking why I would need to keep a Zune AC adapter in the house with so many capable USB connections available these days. Good question! If you're plugging your Zune into your computer for the first time and the Zune software doesn't seem to be recognizing your Zune, this will be especially interesting for you. Is all you see on the Zune screen a battery image with a lightening bolt in the center of the screen (in other words the battery image is not where it belongs in the lower right hand corner of the device home screen)? Then the AC adapter could be your fix.Recently I bought my second Zune for my son, and the computer with all his songs is an older (like circa 2002) Gateway...apparently with lower power standard USB ports. If your computer is like mine, it might even tell you when you plug in the Zune for the first time that "the device will function better if you connect it to a high speed USB port" (...or the message says something like that anyway). I initially thought nothing of this message until I realized that these low powered ports weren't initially charging my second Zune.So I connected the Zune to the AC adapter, let it fully charge, then reconnected to the computer. The Zune software immediately recognized the Zune this time, and I was syncing and listening to music in minutes (I still get that message about "functioning better with higher speed USB ports).So, overall, the Zune AC adapter is a very worthy investment for me and a very good little add on to any Zune.

Paired this with an A55 as I figured it would be good to have the extra bandwidth for the fast 10fps continuous priority and HD video and I'm not disappointed.  Video files save nearly instantaneously from the buffer and even transferring to my laptop, there is virtually no delay - Windows doesn't even get a chance to pop up a "Copying Files...." dialog!  This completely blew me away.For the price, an excellent buy for photographers working with HD video or high resolution RAWs and JPEGs.Would definitely buy again.

His old antenna and booster actually work better than this one did.  I felt stupid because I told him it would be so much better.  We have tried it in several different locations, but it just doesn't get a great reception.  It could be where he lives, so that's why I gave it 3 stars.  But he's out in farm country, so there is nothing to block the signal.

$review_text.: I can't even begin to explain how much easier it is to work in 3D with this little guy. My modeling skills have actually gotten a lot better since I purchased this 3D mouse because I can actually focus more on modeling and less on navigation. Set-up was super easy with a quick driver download from the 3Dconnexion's site for Mac install. I work in Cinema4D and I love being able to switch from modeling mode to camera fly-by mode (which, if using Cappuccino, you can record your mouse movements as a camera animation, genius!)The base is solid and heavy, so it stays put as you use it. The cord is very long so you don't have to worry about where it goes on your desk.Overall, this is an amazing product for the price (much cheaper than a lot of gaming mice, and much more effective).If you work in 3D software, you need this mouse!

$REVIEW.: Always buy in pairs, because one will always fail, especially at the time it's needed the most.  This probably is the inheritance of dead Wall Street junkies like Jobs, deliberately making units to fail, to scrap every little penny out of consumers, and using immature children to prop up its product image through comical reviews, so that they can upgrade their yacht, or upgrade their boyfriend.  I may just well go back to paper maps, tired of buying these junk every year, just right after warranty period expires.Just unbelievable how some stupid people write review, only after using their product few hours or even before they really get to know the products.  Why aren't the executives who makes such greedy/destructive decision being trashed as quickly as the product they deliberately make to fail, and take these paid poster into 6 feet under?  What do these trash people ever do to extract/produce precious earth material required to make this junk electronics, they're so eager to destroy them altogether?There is no reason why electronics component fail, and these should last a lifetime if was designed by qualified engineer who takes their job with pride.  After having to replace GPS unit every year or so, I finally called Garmin to whine, and their customer service personnel was attentive to hearing customer's complaint, and agree to replace the unit, free of charge, even after manufacturer's warranty coverage. This is unlike Nikon idiots who send it back to customers worse condition it was shipped, breaking something else, just to ensure consumers buy/update to newer Nikon junks, every year.  Replacement units were arrived in less than perfect condition; after two consecutive exchanges, Garmin replaced 2 year old LM1450 with this one, free of charge.  How many times do Nikon forces customer to return, lasting how long?

I have to admit that the only reason I'm not giving this kit 5 stars is because I am disappointed in the grey, brown, pink and yellow filters. They just don't pick up enough. It's such a subtle difference, I could use the filter effects on my Nikon to gain the desired effect. Definitely a fun filter kit though. It's a great kit however for the price and it arrived lightning fast. I can see lots of future fun pictures using this kit.

$REVIEW.: The nylon bag that held the feet was torn and so had a hole. I believe the feet scratched up the track during shipment. The track rails are not quite the same width across the whole track because one half of the track the camera mount will slide by itself on a slight angle but then will bind half way down. Adjusting the bearings helped on the side that used to bind but now the other side is looser and so now the camera mount wobbles because the bearings are not tight against the rails. The carrying case is nice but it should have a pocket(s) for the feet. The feet looks to be nylon so when on a smooth counter the whole unit slides across the counter when trying to slide the camera. They should have used rubber feet instead of nylon. So because of the feet allow it to slide unwillingly I have to use a tripod instead. It works for the most part but I'm not happy with the scratches and the rails not being even across the whole unit.

$review_text.: Been with D-TV for many years. We had a Hughes SD TiVo unit and loved it. Got tired of waiting for HD Tivo unit for D-TV, so bought two HR24, and got them linked together. Love the features and fact that you can play from either DVR. Menus are logical and the HD interface upgrade is nice enough (but does not use the whole screen for some reason).The big problem is the remote. Its a very poor layout. Even after 6 months, its not as intuitive and ergonomic as the TiVo peanut. Worse, the buttons are easy to accidentally hit, and sometimes they seem to not work. The system hesitates for as long 5 secs sometimes. Very bad user experience when this happens. When its responsive its pretty good. Can be fast. D-TV is the best option in my area. Take a look at the new TiVo HD unit which I missed by 6 months....after waiting 3 years for it. But I hear it still has an SD interface.No problems doing self install of the dish, 2 HR24 units, and the power inserter. ( I purchased thru other vendors. Its cheaper to have D-TV do your upgrade often at no cost, but self-install gets it done right if you do you homework and are handy.)Th PQ was better than I expected. Some channels have very good HD.

For those looking to upgrade the factory ford 5x7/6x8 speakers, this is a great choice..The install went well, speakers fit into factory holes without any struggle. I did zip tie the speaker wires/connector to the front speakers so they can't get hung up in the window.The adjustable tweeter is a very nice feature, I turned them all to +3, and rotated towards me.Overall the speakers sound very nice and clear, much better than factory. The bass isn't anything to speak of, but I have separate subs for that task. These speakers matched up with subs sound awesome. I'm powering them with a Kenwood deck, 22rms watts. The speakers are loud and clear, didn't break up as I expected at higher levels. May even put an amp on these for more power.Get some at this price!

$review_text.: We've all seen the Laptop cooler's that have fans and suck battery life until the fans burn out in a couple of years, but this is the ultimate alternative. The heatshift pad has a fine felt bottom and a smooth cooling top. Encased between these two layers is a crystal layer that, when heated, becomes a liquid layer to quickly and efficiently transfer heat. Turn off the laptop or take the pad out from under it, and as it cools the liquid resolidifies into its native crystal form. There are other great reviews that show on-screen details of how drastically it cools the laptop, and while I have not tried them myself, I can tell you that the fan on my machine runs at noticably slower speeds when the pad is underneath.

I was very surprised at the quality of this little router. I replace it with my Netgear router which I'm really not too fond of, because my wireless phone always interferes with the Netgear. This little router is a powerhouse for sure. Not only did it not interfere with my wireless phone, but I noticed that the speed increased as well. We tested it with four tablets, two laptops and my desktop, and I have to say that I was really impressed with this little gadget. The instructions are a little tricky, but if you know what you are doing, you won't have any problems with it. If not, you can always call customer service to guide you through the process. This is a keeper!

$REVIEW.: For those of us who would like a larger screen, but a portable computer, this laptop is ideal and it offers many benefits.*  Windows Performance Index of 5.7 on a scale of 1-7.9, but is limited by the video card.  Processor is ranked at 6.3.  To move up the performance scale significantly you would have to spend nearly $300 more.*  Relatively light weight for a 17" laptop.*  The processor is an Intel i3 processor, which makes it snappy.*  Great RAM, 6GB, and 640 GB HDD.*  Video card is decent, but this is not a gaming machine and for the price it quite good.*  The screen is 1600x900 pixels which means it is ideal for watching video and it is LED backlit for great uniform brightness and colors.*  It has an SD card slot, DVD-RW, 802.11 b/g/n, and Bluetooth 2.0.*  Decent battery life given the battery size, processor, and screen.*  Fast boot up time.*  Aesthetically pleasing shell.The negatives about this laptop are:*  Network card is 10/100 Mb/s whereas it would have been just as easy to put in a 100/1000 Mb/s controller.  This means that transferring data across a fast internal home network will be slow.*  The track pad is slow in responsiveness.*  The keyboard feels unnecessarily cheap and if you type a lot and fast, you damage a key.*  The screen hinges are also unnecessarily cheap that you could possibly break, and in fast opening and closing they seem to flex a bit.*  There is bloat ware on this laptop, but is removable.  There is no reason to buy Norton or McCaffe and it is better to use MS Essentials which is free.*  HP doesn't provide a restore disk with the drivers; they are on a partition on the HDD.  There is also no Windows 7 media disc should you need to reinstall Windows 7.*  HP customer service is usually some kid in India who is looking for a real job after college and couldn't care less about your IT problems.  Don't call unless absolutely necessary.All in all not a bad laptop, but I wouldn't pay more than $500 delivered.  Amazon has had this priced under $500 regularly and can be found at Staples or other places during sales during the year for the same price.

$REVIEW.: I bought this grip for my Canon 7D because I could not afford the Canon model. After receiving it from the shipper in good order, I tried to out immediately on the camera. The fit was very good. The camera recognized both batteries with no problems. While it does appear to be a little bit more &#34;flimsy&#34; than the canon model, It still fits very well and feels solid. I only advise to keep in mind that this is made out of plastic and is not as hardy as the canon one. Functions flawlessly, does what its supposed to do, and its a third of the price. Great purchase.

$REVIEW.: When I first got this unit my initial reaction was why does it have such a large metal face? However, I quickly learned, once the iPod is connected to helps fill in the space.As for the unit itself I found that it worked perfectly with my 2nd gen iPod Touch. However, I did have to remove the case to make the connection. I also had a hard time lining up the dock connecter to the iPod with the spring loaded support causing all sorts of problems. It just gets in the way and is a bad design. Even the control buttons next to the iPod connection work.I disagree with the other reviewer who said it plays as soon as connected. I didn't have that problem. I connected the iPod and it didn't play until I told it to.As for sound quality, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was pretty good!There are a few features that would make it better and worthy of four stars. How about a battery backup? A remote control for the iPod would be great!The alarm clock is an alarm clock. It works as expected.Overall, an average product that could use improvement.

The next step up would be Grado SR60 or Sony MDR-v6 (which i own) but those are a lot bulkier and more expensive.It has very strong bass for its size.

$REVIEW.: The Amazon Kindle is a great tool and one the best things about it is how compact it is.  It weighs next to nothing and is thinner than the average cell phone.  While those are both great benefits, they also give the Kindle the feeling of being somewhat delicate.  Amazon makes a folio cover, but at $60 it's definitely a bit pricey.  I searched through Amazon for different options before settling on the Belkin sleeve and I think I made the right choice.While the Belkin sleeve is not a folio case, I think it is a much better option for protection.  When I throw the Kindle in my purse, I like that the case covers it from all angles and is tightly fitted to the shape of it.The inside of the case is lined with a very soft fuzzy material that protects the surface of the Kindle, front and back, from scratches.  The exterior material is water-proof, which is very nice and the zipper is weather sealed.  I can't imagine taking the risk of carrying my Kindle out in the rain, but I guess having the option to do so is always nice.Another nice feature is the front pocket (where the pleats) are.  The zippered pocket (also weather-sealed) is a great place to stow away the charger plug and cable.  This pocket is also padded so I'm not worried about the accessories being pressed into the surface of the Kindle and causing marks on it.I'm definitely glad I picked this over a folio case because I feel I'm getting way better protection at one third the price!

$REVIEW.: Having decided to cut the cable cord, I purchased a Terk digital antenna at Best Buy for twice as much as I bought this latest Terk antenna here on Amazon. The first Terk I purchase was not amplified and was essentially a flat wedge type antenna. It would lay down flat or stand up straight with the provided plastic stand. I did not pick up all the channels I wanted and at times I would have to re-position the antenna to bring in channels that were at one time coming in fine. I decided after doing a little research that I would buy this Terk Amplified antenna to replace the best buy model. This one has worked almost flawlessly, I live in a somewhat rural area and it works just fine. Granted there are not alot of high buildings or homes around me so there are not many things that get in the way aside from a few mountain ranges. Upon receiving this Terk amplified antenna I sat it on top of my entertainment center slightly extended the dipoles and connected it to my television. It worked immediately, no adjusting, no moving the dipoles it just worked and has continued to work since day one. Antennas are a tricky thing in that many external factors that are beyond your control will influence your reception. The best bet before you buy one is to go to [...] and use their handy reception guide to give you a little wisdom before spending your money. All in all I recommend this antenna however do a little research to find the solution that is right for you.

$review_text.: I have had the Motorola Xoom for about 2 weeks now.  I held off initially because the 3.0 (Honeycomb) OS just wasn't ready.  So I held off.  I finally dove in with 3.1 and was quickly upgraded to 3.2 and most (if not all) of the biggest issues are now resolved.Most people want to know what they problems are first, so they can figure out if they really want it.  So I will cover them first.1.  The Xoom is heavier than most other comparable out now.  If you plan to use this as an e-Reader, this is an issue. (Note you will also find this under the plus section as well)2.  Price.  It only comes in a 32GB model, so the price (appears) higher than comparable items (that only pack 16 GB of storage).  Though you are getting more for your money, it is a higher entry point, and that makes it a non-starter for some.3.  Smudges.  Motorola has a habit of putting glass on their products that seem to attract smears and streaks, like no other product on the planet.4.  Honeycomb.  This is another plus and minus.  I put it here, because many of the "flaws" that people find in the Xoom were problems with the 3.0 version of Honeycomb.  The device unfairly gets the blame here.  Now that 3.2 is out, those have gone away, but the perception of problems with the Xoom persist, even though they are gone.5.  Honeycomb Part 2... There is presently less than stellar number of apps designed for Honeycomb.  It is getting better by the day, and as the market grows, so will the number of apps and games, but for now, if you like to play games on your device, you will find the experience limiting.OK, so now we got the bad out of the way, lets cover the good.1.  Sturdy.  Some complain about the weight of the Xoom, but it feels and is SOLID.  It is not flimsy, and you don't feel like it is going to snap in your hands if you put just a bit too much pressure on it.2.  Productivity.  Since this device (and Honeycomb) is built as a tablet OS and not just a big iPod Touch (like the iPad) it is meant for getting things done.  The Widescreen layout and easy connection of a Bluetooth keyboard, along with apps like Evernote make this a great out of the box productivity tool.3.  Flash, it runs it and as well as any device.  iOS will NEVER be able to do that.4.  No corners cut.  It has 32 GB of storage, 1 GB of RAM and an SD Card slot (which now works as of Honeycomb 3.2).  Others cut one of those corners to lower the price... but cheaper is not necessarily good if you are getting less as well.Overall, while there are pluses and minuses to any tablet, the reputation (which really belongs to the early release of Honeycomb) is the only real "problem" with the Xoom.  If you want to get things done... this is the device to get.  If you want an e-reader or something to play games on... then you may wish to look at something else.

I must warn you: this device has a variety of bugs, the most annoying of which is the fact that the battery periodically drains down, leaving you with Zero power.You would think that HP would put a fix on line or would instruct its call-center staff on how to solve the problem. No such luck. The call center staff are unable to solve the problem; they keep telling ytou to install the latest BIOS, which I did immediately upon purchasing the device.So, I have to say: unless HP fixes the various problems with this device, CAVEAT EMPTOR.I'm about ready to buy a Palm, despite the high switching costs.

Needless to say, that screen protector was expensive.My two other kids also have Kindle Fires.  Instead of buying another expensive screen protector, I decide to try this product.  Like all screen protectors, these screen protectors are realitive easy to put on.  The real challenge is how quickly can you put it on the screen.  No matter how clean or dust free the screen is, dust can stick to the screen quickly than you say "excuse me".  Anyway, I destroyed one of the screen protector because I was slow and clumsy.  The next two went on without any trouble.  I used a credit card to remove the bubbles.  These screen protectors look tough enough and should last a few scratches.

This monitor will definitely help your aim in shooter games such as cs, cod series, dod, whatever other crap you can think of.This monitor is definitely worth its pricetag when you see the difference it can make in a gaming environment.As far as 3D vision... I would never attempt to play video games in 3D. I might be interested in adult films in 3D, but games... dgaf.The fact that this monitor also comes with an adjustable stand at this price point is also very appealing to me, I'm very anal about my setup being ergonomic.TLDR; If like pc gaming enough to spend over $200 on a graphics card, you'd might as well bust open your wallet to buy this and give yourself the ultimate gaming experience. This model is the best price:performance of all the 120hz units on the market right now.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect for serious gamers

$review_text.: I needed something that could record footage from old gaming consoles such as NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, etc. so I could make online video reviews.I've tried all sorts of PC capture cards and they always seem to have a problem dealing with the crazy resolutions that old consoles produce along with the whole de-interlacing mystery. The Colossus works great for capturing HD footage from a PS3, but it just didn't seem to agree with an old Nintendo.Basically any time I would use a capture card to capture NES footage, I'd get some weird flickering on the finished file... or it just wouldn't work altogether... or I'd get audio/video sync issues. All of the above really.This device works masterfully for my purposes. My setup is that I have my consoles running through an RCA switcher which then hooks directly to an old CRT television (after all, old gaming consoles are meant to be played on old CRTs). The CRT has RCA out so then I have the CRT connected directly to the DVD recorder with RCA cables.It works great! Records a beautiful 29.997 FPS picture of your game footage with no flickering whatsoever. I overpaid for this thing, but I don't even care. After trying all sorts of capture cards on my PC and jacking with dozens of software settings trying to make it jive with my NES, I was so relieved that this thing finally accomplished what I wanted it to that I didn't even bother trying to box it up and take it back to the local store in favor of buying the exact same unit online for $70 cheaper.For those of you looking to do something similar with your recorded game footage from a classic gaming console read on... for everyone else, you probably won't care about this...First, be sure to finalize the DVD in the DVD recorder. Your PC will not read the disc otherwise - nor will any other DVD player. When finalizing the disc, be sure to select that you DO NOT want to copy-protect the DVD.Second, put the DVD in your PC disc drive. Open the DVD with Windows Explorer and you can browse the files and folders. You will need to go into the VIDEO_TS folder on the DVD and copy the large .vob files to your PC hard drive. These are actually the video files that your video footage is stored on. The .vob extension is just another file format for MPEG-2 which is the DVD standard.Third, you most likely will need to convert the .vob file format to something else if you are wanting to edit your game footage into a video review. I use a freeware program called MPEG Streamclip and convert the .vob file format. After you have converted the file format to something else, you can import it into Premiere or Vegas or any other program that you are using to edit your footage.You may not have to convert the file format, but for me I kept getting audio/video sync issues whenever I imported the raw .vob files directly into Premiere. I had to convert the video files to DV-AVI. That was what worked for me for importing the footage into Premiere, but you may find a completely different setting that works for you.
$SUMMARY.: Works great for my purpose...

$REVIEW.: Pros - excellent small size and no wires results in less clutter on the desk.Cons - Keyboard has been reduced in size so much that the PageUp, PageDown, Home and End keys require also pressing a function key at the same time which is awkward and annoying.Touchpad has almost no configuration options, no sensitivity setting, no scroll zones and verticle scrolling requires dragging two fingers up or down the middle of the touchpad and parallel with the sides.  Since your hand and fingers are not typically positioned in a way that is also exactly parallel to the sides of the touchpad, scrolling can be inconsistent.  Touch and drag almost never works.As a desktop replacement keyboard, this is not the greatest solution, but there are few products that include an integrated touchpad.As a remote control keyboard, perhaps to a laptop connected to a TV, this is an excellent choice.Note: I purchased this direct from Logitech since Amazon had a two month shipping delay.
$review_summary.: Not perfect, but fairly good - touchpad has been dumbed down

I'm very satisfied with the performance of the adapter, I'm able to shoot in excess of 1,200 shots (RAW) from a 32gig card.  I don't know the exact number because the camera only goes to 999.

$review_text.: I bought a Toshiba Satellite L775D-S7340 to supplement and later replace my 9 year old Toshiba Satellite 1955-S805.  I bought another Toshiba because of the durability of my older laptop.  The price of the L775D-S7340 was 1/4 of what I paid for the 1955-S805, but has 8 times the memory capacity.  When I turned the L775D-S7340 on I used the power supply to charge the battery while I created 2 sets of Recovery Discs.  I then downloaded 4 security programs that I use on my older Toshiba laptop as well as 76 Updates for Windows.  I plugged my Logitech Wireless Keyboard and Mouse which worked immediately.  I had no problem with the keyboard but prefer the curved keys which are on my old Laptop to the flat keys on the L775D-S7340  The weak link on L775D-S7340 is the Touch pad. The Touch pad is difficult to use compared to my old Toshiba Laptop. I really do not like Touch Pads and like to have a bit more space when I am using the computer which is why I have the wireless keyboard and mouse. The first accessory that I bought when I got my first laptop was a infrared mouse.  My older laptop is better built and studier than any of the newer laptops regardless of the manufacturer. Another thing that I don't care for are some of the Apps that come with it that I have no use for which I will delete. The Satellite L775D-S7340 is a very nice computer and is a good buy for the features that you get and I recommend this model to someone who is either interested in another laptop computer or for a first computer.

$review_text.: Hope I'm not updating this review in a few months to lower the rating because so far I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase.  I will never again buy routers with internal antenna.  This puppy has such a good radio signal all around the house that we no longer need repeaters.  The phone & tablet both of which used to take a bit to pick up Wi-Fi when in the back of the house or basement (even with the repeaters) now immediately grab the wireless signal.  Barely any lag time.The download/upload speeds have improved as well.  That is probably due the fact that our repeaters were not fancy ones with two radios  - one radio to retrieve the broadcast signal from the Access Point & another radio to broadcast it out.  With only one radio (as ours have) your repeater has to do double duty, both retrieve & send the broadcast signal from the AP which effectively cuts your bandwidth in half.  Thus we have faster speeds.
$review_summary.: Simple, fast, strong radio signal & looks pretty wicked - what could be better?

If you're not careful you can easily damage it and thereby making the speaker inoperable.  You need both of your hand to turn on and off the speaker.  To my surprise, I found my speaker extremely hard to turn on and off.  Anyone having carpal tunnel or arthritic hand will find it impossible to turn on and off this speaker.Maybe my speaker is semi-defective but I am disappointed that brand like Altec Lansing will put their label on speaker like this.

$REVIEW.: I needed a new switch for my bedroom since my old Netgear 5 port switch did not have enough ports to work with the number of devices I have accumulated in my room.  The upside to this update was the fact that the TP-Link is a lot faster, as well.  My Netgear was limited to 10/100 and the upgraded speed is very noticeable.  I have an Airport Express that plugs into it that I use for music and as a separate wireless network to get more range for wireless devices.  Plugging the Airport Express into the TP-LInk has made everything a lot faster than it was before.I should mention that this was plug and play.  I simply unplugged the cables from my old router and plugged them into the TP-LINK and plugged it in.  Everything worked without a problem.My main complaint, which is not limited to this device, is the plug for the power socket is on one side and the ethernet ports are on the other.  So, no matter how you put it in your system, you see cables.  I have my TP_Link hidden behind some gear, so you can't see it without moving stuff out of the way.  For home use, I prefer something that looks like the Airport Extreme, but this has a lot more ports, so you just need to find a place to put it where it won't be seen.

$review_text.: I am a long standing Comcast customer and I simply ADORE this Magnavox machine! NO incompatibility problems for me.  I own THREE.... in addition to a HD Tivo box.  Like the Tivo box, this Maggie has an OTA air tuner that I can use with my outdoor antenna.  It has a diqital QAM tuner that I can run a coax lead from my Comcrap cable straight into... bypassing the cable card in my HD Tivo.  By doing this I get the local channels of SEVERAL adjoining municipalities that are BLOCKED by Comcrap's poorly performing cable card. Their techs are for the most part clueless on all things cable card related!I see some idiots complaining about "missing" and "scrambled" channels. Are you people STUPID enough to expect this device to pick up these channels for FREE? I did my research going in and knew beforehand that ONLY the clear channel unencrypted channels could be viewed with the Magnavox machine's QAM digital tuner.  In order to watch the "missing" channels I have to PAY.... Pay to use my TIVO as the Comcrap cable card allows the more conventional cable channels...HBO, ESPN, A&E...; etc to pass. I'll note that ALL the shopping channels are unencrypted clear channels... BOTH CSPAN's, WGN... Maybe a couple more in addition to all those wonderful in market AND out of market locals.  Note that many of the IN MARKET locals are not carried by Comcrap... the newer three digit "extra" digital HD channels!  I bought the Maggie to veiw and record these many local channels ... many over a hundred miles away...that my outdoor antenna struggles with and that the government forces Comcrap to carry.  Of course I don't expect this current situation to last forever. I'm sure those bloodsuckers at Comcrap have lobbyists at work as we speak trying to BUY legislation so that they can scramble ALL the channels.. locals or not.  But, as it stands today as of January 3, 2012, there are DOZENS of clear QAM channels the Maggie picks up that my official, approved... and EXPENSIVE Comcrap supplied cable card/Tivo combo device can't!So much for the TUNER/Channels part on this review.As far as the build/parts quality and ease of use go, this Magnavox device is more than adequate. A few minor bugs and irritations.  As many other reviewers have noted, there aren't many of these type devices left. Very little choice.  I do feel the Magnavox provides good value for the money spent. Since these are SD devices only, the stock hard drive provides plenty of capacity.  I wish at some point in time High Definition DVR's might come available.  They would need MUCH larger drives built in.  Time will tell.

$REVIEW.: I was looking to upgrade my speakers for my home theater setup. I had been shopping the local stores & had found this exact set for as much as $600! They sounded great in the stores & was told by salesmen about their quality.Of course not believing everything I'm told I had to research online & found many good reviews and then... I found these on Amazon. Exact same set Signed, Sealed, Delivered & they were mine within a week for $187 TOTAL!I have a dedicated TV room that's about 10x14 and these speakers fill it with beautiful sound. I'm impressed and I luv 'em! Thanks Amazon!

$REVIEW.: I bought this Plasma TV and it it Great, EXCEPT that I cannot view any JPEG images.  What a hassle I went through buying dirrerent memory cards and PC card adapters only to find out that it will not display standard jpeg images and only specific images straight out of certain cameras. I have an older Minolta Digital Camera and these images do not conform, hog-wash. If you want to change the images in ANY way before showing them, red-eye, color balance, contrast, etc., it will not display them either.I have found the same issue is true for their DVD Recorders as well; no jpegs except from specific cameras.

$REVIEW.: The sound quality of this speaker was surprisingly good for how small it is

 I wanted a speaker for under my  pillow and since some reviewers did just that I thought it would be okay

 But with the volume of my Ipod up to maximum I can barely hear it through my pillow


 For on top of the pillow it's great, really good sound so I'm giving it a 5 star review.

I received it as promised, it was well packed ,and it turned out to be better than I exspected..The case is very strong and will protecct your earbuds with no problem , being a man I have a tendency to put things in my pants pocket. And the first thing I know I have sat down on ever what it was, and mashed it beyond recognition. This case sports Two elastic nets , one on each clam shell, this holds the earbuds in place and still has enough room for a pack of replacement tips for the Buds. On the other side I have room for the charge cable and my Marware capacitive Stylus for my Kendle HD.. If you need somethig along this line I would highly recomend this case.Flay

$REVIEW.: I've had this for about 2 weeks now and was nervous about the negative reviews which stated that the battery didn't hold a charge and discharged very quickly under use. I am please to say that I've seen none of these problems and would go so far as to say that it actually lasts longer than the official Sony battery that came with my A33 camera. This battery also fits perfectly without any shims. The charger works fast and I love that it will allow me to charge up at home or in the car. Great value! I'm probably going to pick up a second battery, just for those heavy shooting days.

$review_text.: Got this for a child to use on the nightstand to charge an iPod touch at night.  Small footprint so it can fit pretty much anywhere, charges with no issues, and allows the iPod to dock without removing the case (MAJOR benefit). The fact that you can re-orient the thing to sit in both landscape and portrait format is a bonus, since kids often want to use the iPod for horizontal gaming and videos.  The sound is fine for what it is.  Lots of apps can be downloaded for free in order to turn this dock into an "alarm clock" as well.  Bottom line, fine for a charger that also does a couple of other things!

$REVIEW.: As a 'collector' of headphones, all headphones have their own unique sound with varying degrees of quality.  Essentially, each pair of headphones has its satisfactory qualities as well as its qualms.STREET by 50 Cent Wired In-Ear Headphones - Black by SMS Audioare a solid pair of headphones.  The sound, solid qualities easily outnumber the qualms.  The headphones stay in your ears (or at least they stayed in mine) without any hassle, which I can attest to a pair ofMonster NCredible NErgy In-Ear Headphonesthat I recently reviewed.  The balance of sound within these headphones is also better than those in my opinion, though not overclouded with bass like Beats by Dr. Dre Solo HD White On-Ear Headphone from Monster.  The bass is balanced more to the left as it should be, but the mix between the treble and mid frequencies seems well attuned for.As far as the package, the control talk feature works soundly, rivaling Dr. Dre's Solo Beats feature (volume controls) and trumping NCredible Nergy's (minimal pause/play button).  Additionally, the package contains a small case for the phones, as well as a manual and a booklet of accessories and other products.  Honestly, there is little to gripe about these headphones.  The design is cool, especially the blue/black/silver trim.  I would recommend these over other headphones I own and definitely as a cheaper alternative to say Dr. Dre Beats By Dre solo headphones.  Are they as elite? Perhaps not, but these are solid headphones and incredibly portable by all means.

$review_text.: I have the Apple branded Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter for using my external monitors at home.  However, when I was at school or at a meeting and needed to plug in my MacBook Pro into a projector, I was out of luck if I did not have my adapter.  So I purchased this one to keep in my laptop bag, so regardless of where I am or if I remembered to take my adapter with me, I can hook my MacBook Pro to a projector or other VGA device.  I purchased this one over purchasing another Apple branded one since the Apple one is $30, which is kind of high.  This one resembles the Apple branded one with two exceptions, the VGA connector is outside of the plastic (sticking up outside of the box, the Apple one is inside), and the white box is a bit fatter than the Apple one (the part that hooks to your VGA cable).  The packaging that mine came in looked just like the Apple on, just without an Apple picture on it.  I hooked it to an HP 21" HD monitor at 1920x1080 @60HZ and had no problem, this adapter worked just like the Apple one and I could see no problems!In the end, I got this as a backup one for use on the go, it seems to work just like the Apple one and I have had no problem yet.  If I encounter any problems I will let you know.  I highly recommend this for anyone who needs to use external monitors with a MacBook, with a Mini DisplayPort, and does not want to pay the $30 that Apple wants for its adapter.Also, since some have mentioned watching out where you buy these, I will let you know that I purchased this NEW from BestDealUSA, Fulfilled By Amazon, and item arrived NEW, in packaging, and worked perfectly!  Although it was a bit different from the picture, but not by much (the VGA connection was not pushed into the adapter, but stuck out).

$REVIEW.: I bought this recently to replace an older 5 disc Sony model that I spent nearly 200 for just 2 years ago


Some changes I noticed include: they did remove the front panel menu navigation buttons, so make sure you don't break/lose your remote

Also gone is the cool 2 color front panel lights around disc buttons 1-5


One good thing though is that they made it shorter in height, thin is in

Never had a problem w/ my old one, Sony is among the leaders in reliability


I like the dot matrix display a lot- which features a 3 stage dimmer.This model DVP-NC875V(Black) is a great value

I bought the black because it matches the rest of my AV gear, but it's also available in silver
I got mine from a local retailer for 123, new

The on-screen menu is clear and easy to use
The manual is also easy to understand and well written

Set up was painless, I had it out of the box and playing with-in minutes

The remote is sleek/thin, easy to use, tons of buttons, and fits my hand well w/ the bottom finger groove
Some cool buttons are the (2x & 4x) zoom and instant replay

It can be easily programmed to control the volume on your receiver(lacks a mute button) as well as control your TV.It features hi-fi

multichannel SACD - though unfortunately only playable through the analog 5.1 outputs, would be MUCH better if it was playable through the superior digital outs instead.(Running one wire is also a much cleaner install than having to run 6 for audio to the machine's rear) I hope they someday get this right.It features a list of various play modes, including program play, shuffle(random) play, repeat play, A-B repeat play
CD/DVD text compatible(if available)

Built-in dolby digital/DTS decoding, great for people who don't already have decoding in a receiver, lacks pro logic II decoding I've seen others have


Of course, selectable progressive scan.It has BOTH optical & coaxial digital outs
Superior 108MHz/12 bit video DAC! 192kHz/24 bit audio DAC! Sony's new precision drive 3 system
40 disc resume memory- very convenient feature and a lot more than others offer! region 1 or all region/NTSC only


Built-in screen saver(after 15 min.)
Energy star! It shuts off after 30 min

of inactivity
Great feature! Power consumption is 14w


S/N 115db
Distortion: .003% Dynamic range: DVD video & SACD =103db/CD=99db.Just a couple cons: lacks(higher end)HDMI output, doesn't play WMA, DVD-RAM, DVD-ROM, CD-ROM(photo CD format)or DVD-audio discs


However, it is extremely hard to find a player that's compatible w/ every single format out there
What it will play: DVD, CD, SACD, VCD, JPEG, Kodak picture CD, MP3, CD-R/RW, DVD +/- R/RW, CD-ROM(music CD/video CD format).Also, a personal issue, I still wish DVD players had built-in digital clocks like VCRs did
I also wish you had a choice to rotate the open tray either way when exchanging discs


Keep in mind the 5 disc models are quite a bit larger/wider than the single disc models, but they do offer you more flexibility in return.One final piece of advice, please use component video for your video signal (if you can) and invest in quality set of wires, like monster cable
S-Video is the next best thing

Composite aka A/V cables should NEVER be used for a DVD player, even though they are usually thrown in the box for free

Composite: Good for VCRs, Horrible for DVDs

 Anyways, hope my review helps..
this is a great product so go get one!

$REVIEW.: As I prepared to write this review I realized I don't think I've ever not liked a Belkin product.  They seem to see a need and either solve it in a creative way (iPod and iPhone accessories come to mind) or solve it by having their own quality version of a cable or a charger or whatever the product is.  The reason I bring this up is because this cable is another example of "the Belkin way".  They've made a quality, sturdy, snugly fitting cable that delivers video and images from your phone to your big screen TV.  The price has come down on this and even if it hadn't - the old "you get what you pay for" is true to a certain extent in cables.  Super cheap will not hold up.  Cheap will be fine for a while and for most folks longer.  Mid-range will almost always suffice (I am considering this cable in this category).  Pricey is almost always a waste of money (unless you have an ear/eye/system that really distinguishes between great and super great).  That's my opinion anyway, and I didn't notice anything but a clear picture on the pictures and videos streamed to the TV.

$review_text.: The tablet has some nice pros going for it


It has a nice feel and it runs smoothly depending on what you do with yours


I use mine while waiting  - I ride with people sometimes and read and I sit in the bed and want to lounge - and thought it worked really well for that
I do have to say that I was really surprised by how thick it was when I first got it, then even more surprised by how well it handled considering how thick the item is


There's a light-weight quality to it that allowed me to use it easily, tilting it this way and that while goofing off - I mean testing it
I suppose that's what Lite means.I want to also note that I'm tech-savvy enough to utilize an item, but I'm not going to quote specifications

There are other reviewers doing that and they seem really knowledgeable, so they're a better option for that
I tried the item out and tested it in the real world, using it at the doctor or during breaks or on the go, if that helps any.I played a lot of applications for trial and the tablet ran smoothly, not having some of the hiccups I've noticed in other items when it comes to smaller games
There were a few issues when it came to some of the larger games I've purchased, with the requirements making me pause as it lagged it certain spots
I could adjust settings and control the issues, but there was still so lag

Playback on videos online was nice and movies played great as well, never once having an issue


To me this was a big plus

I also read comics on my tablets, and while a 7 &#34; screen is not the most optimal setup for it, the tablet does a great job with fill and with colors


That's always been an issue for me when using something like a Kindle - perhaps it has been fixed by now, but there was always a framing issue that bothered me
With this, no framing

You can always zoom on frames if so inclined to make up for a smaller screen, which I do with this one
I read a book on it while goofing off; the read went well as expected, which I didn't really doubt
Android readers have always done right by me


 Online use is good, no problems noted, with everything from directions to the restaurant to looking up random trivial working out.Other reviewers have mentioned the price, and that is one issue the tablet has going against it


It will get cheaper as time goes on, so while it is an issue while writing this, it won't be for long


Another thing is the 8 GB internal memory, but with the ability to connect a mini-SD to almost every device these days, it wasn't too much for me to consider for myself but something I felt worth noting


 I'm not a video-chatter so the lack of one camera does not bother me
I honestly have never liked a camera pointed at my face while using a device, but that's something you might want to look into if that is a selling/buying point.

$review_summary.: Nice tablet

$REVIEW.: I love this little computer.  The netbook is half the size and weight of my laptop, making it extremely portable. I've been taking it on all my travels since I got it. It is really true that the battery keeps it running for up to 8 hours, which is more than enough time for cross-country airline trips. Also, because of its small size, it easily fits on the tray table of my shrinking airline seat in the economy class, even if the person in front of me reclines (this is not true of my laptop). But the best thing is that this netbook runs real Windows-7 (as opposed to Windows-Light which many brands of netbooks run.)  This means that I am able to load it with my favorite programs and apps and it works great.  In other words, this little computer is not just for checking your email and surfing the web, but you can do real work with it.  The only downside is that it's not as fast as a top-of-the-line laptop for CPU intense tasks.  But you should not worry about this unless you play chess on your computer or solve differential equations, or run place and route for CAD tools.  I do those things, but not when I am traveling, and not on this little computer.I bought this computer five months ago, and I liked it immediately, but I waited until now to write a review.  I wanted to make sure that it will not have any issues.  I also wanted to make sure that I can install my favorite software on it and run that stuff reasonably well.  Considering its price, this is a great value.

$review_text.: I bought this Garmin mount to replace a Bracketron Nav-Mat mount
Why replace the Nav-Mat you ask? You have to use the wind shield suction cup attachment to attach your GPS to the Nav-Mat, like all suction cups, they come loose, at the worst possible times

It's very annoying and dangerous to have to resuction it while you are driving

This Garmin mount solves that problem, the mounting stem doesn't rely on a suction for its attachment.DECEMBER 2012 UPDATE: I now own a smartphone which functions as a GPS so I'm no longer using my Garmin GPS as much
I purchased this new car mount for my phone:Arkon SM410 Universal Windshield with Dashboard and Vent Mount for Smartphones and PDAsYou can attach it to the vent or use the suction cup
I wanted my phone at eye level with the road so the vent mount option was out and you already know how I hate suction cups
Much to my surprise, their mount uses a ball and socket which matches that of the Garmin Mount so I was able to take off the phone holder from the Akron mount and attach it to stem of this Garmin mount
It fits perfectly! So for those of you looking to continue to use your smartphone with this mount, I highly recommend picking up that Akron mount.

$review_text.: I have had different brands of CD burners over many years and found the Sony brand to be one that provides consistent quality and performance

This has been my third Sony CD/DVD burner


In the past I've also owned Memorex (good) and Lite-On (they actually provide a technology many brands utilize)


I have this installed on a six year old self-built Pentium-4 system running at 2.66ghz and it runs fine
I would expect that older and less able processor systems would be suspect of newer drives based on the processor and resource demands (such as Pentium 3 processor systems)


One should take this in consideration regardless of brands when updating any component of older systems

I have no hesitation or reservations with the Sony brand for most electronic components in general though.

$REVIEW.: I use the older WD TV Mini at every TV in my house to stream from local hard drives. I find it much better than the WD TV Live in terms of access speed and the time it takes to recognize a 2 TB hard drive and just plain scrolling through the files and folders on the hard drive. I do not want to use the device to access the pay services on the internet so for me, I rate the WD TV Mini much higher than the WD TV Live. I just found the WD TV Live to be very, very slow at recognizing files on the external hard drive.

$REVIEW.: I also own this case for the GS4 also and it looks roughly the same. I only recently got the case for the X, so I can only assume over time it will end up wearing the same as that of my S4. The only difference between the two phones seems to be that the positioning of the buttons on the X requires a bit of trickery to ensure the plastic can sufficiently wrap around the sides. The case comes as two pieces, an inner silicone layer with space made in the corners for the material to squish in the event of impact. The outer layer is a hard plastic that is surprisingly durable. I have not been very kind to the case and it only shows impact damage on the bottom corner plastic from landing in some gravel. The covers over the ports are nice and hold well; the plastic and silicone do not show any signs of wear even after continuous disassembly/reassembly on my S4. The only &#34;bad&#34; thing about this case is the screen protector it comes with. It is thick, cut smaller than the lip of the case(why?) and does that awful rainbow thing when it gets fingerprints and oil on it, which it frequently does.

$REVIEW.: I want to love this product, and sometimes I do.After moving all of my media equipment into the other room, I needed a solution for controlling them from the sitting room, and didn't want to spend loads of money on an expensive, dealer-installed universal remote control.I tried a couple of products that left me unhappy and desirous of a better solution. I first purchased one of the Next Generation extenders after reading the positive reviews on amazon. I set it up properly, but was disappointed when I realized that almost all of my equipment required the A/B signal switch to be set one way, while my cable box required the other.So I bit the bullet and ordered another unit, thinking I could use one transmitter battery to control both receivers. I was pleased to find that my experiment worked, and having two units properly controlled all of my equipment.Happily ever after? Not quite. This product is very testy. When it works, it works flawlessly and guests are always amazed. When it doesn't work, it drives me crazy having to go into the other room to control my entertainment system.Fortunately, I don't watch soooo much TV and this solution works for now. I probably will end up getting a fancy remote sooner or later though.NOTE: I use this product with the Logitech Harmony 700 and have no issues with compatibility.

I carry this keyboard around me and I love it because it is pretty much a full size keyboard so you don't feel like your fingers are scrunched up. The only negative is that the esc button is too large so I do end up hitting the esc when i want to hit the #1. Once you get used to that it is fine though, but it is annoying.

$REVIEW.: My son got this as a gift on christmas and was pretty much unreachable for the rest of the day.  He's three years old and loves to play Temple Run 2.  There are a could of things that make this tablet frustrating and a few more that make it down right unusable.Frustrating:1. screen has about zero viewing angle.  Even staring at it straight on the screen looks dim and almost opaque at the edges.2. it's very slow to boot up and unlock3. Temple Run 2, preinstalled, is choppy during normal use4. on screen software buttons get in the way of little swiping fingers, especially the screen shot button which makes Temple Run 2 stutter even worse than normal.  This almost always results in the end of the game. (extremely frustrating for my son)5. kid, obviously the target audience, dropped it, causing the plastic frame to come partially apart.  Goes back together easily enough but now the power button doesn't line up properly so it's difficult to put the tablet to sleep or turn it off.6. bad battery lifeAlmost unusable:1. Temple Run 2 comes preinstalled, but takes play store upgrades as expected.  After a recent upgrade, any time the tablet loses power Temple Run 2 refuses to load.  I was forced to uninstall the upgrade, then reinstall it before the game would run again.  Doing this once wouldn't be too bad, but having to do it every time my son wants to play is ridiculous.2. In response to the above issue, I tried keeping the tablet charged and preventing it from losing power.  This does prevent the issue with Temple Run 2 not running, but it makes the tablet run slower and slower the longer it stays powered on.  After the second day the game runs just about as slowly as when screen captures were inadvertently being made.  Just horrible.The above review doesn't even compare to that of my son's.  He's three and is pretty much fixated on any screen time he can get.  At this point when he's offered his allotment for the day on the tablet he cries and asks to please be given his old phone (galaxy s2) instead.So that's it, the target audience hates this product so much it makes them cry

$review_text.: I picked these bad boys up during a sale at the store I work for a while back, mostly for use as speakers to practice mixing on as an aspiring DJ since they have an RCA connector that allowed for them to be easily connected to the mixer I have. I had a set of Creative Labs SBS 560 5.1 speakers hooked up to my computer for passive listening purposes that I was perfectly happy with and function quite admirably to this day. Since that time, though, I've transition away from a desktop and a large L desk setup to a much smaller cart style desk and I've gotten rid of my desktop entirely.Kind of a long story for it's purpose, so I'll cut it off there with a TL;DR summary of &#34;I don't have the physical space around my computer to make effective use of a 5.1 setup anymore.&#34; As a result, and since I've been focusing my musical efforts on learning to play the drums and production vs. DJing as of late, I decided to pack up the 5.1 setup yesterday and move these guys over to my computer desk. I've been listening to some music while working on other things this morning and I've gotta hand it to Logitech... they've made a damn fine pair of speakers with this model. I usually practice mixing with the volume down relatively low seeing as how I'm still at an amateur level and don't want any of the people I live with tearing my head off over the racket of a botched beat matching process. Not to mention that I'm usually more focused on the mixing process than I am on the music itself when I practice, at this stage of learning almost to the exclusion of the actual music. As a result, while I knew they were good speakers that produced solid and clear sound, I hadn't listened to them in a way that would allow me to appreciate their full glory. I had been debating a higher end pair, the audiophile in me being able to convince my frugal side to consider going as high as the Z623 model, but for a moderately-sized room these are perfectly powerful enough to fill the room with delicious, nutritious, high quality, crystal clear sound waves from whatever music suits you.Currently listening to Daniel Waples' new album, Lisn, which is very mellow in relation to my usual fare of dubstep, drum 'n' bass and that sort of thing. Much more focus on the high-end, no doubt. These speakers capture that part of the sound extremely well, while the subwoofer still squeezes every bit of &#34;oomph&#34; out of each percussion/drum hit to make it just as satisfying to listen to in that regard as any big room club song... more, actually, but that's because it's Daniel Waples instead of some rinsed out to hell and back track everyone and their mother has heard so many times they're sick of it, not so much because of the speakers. You can literally hear all of the fine details of the recording... not just the notes, but you can make out the underlying sound of the precise way in which his hand hits his Hang with each stroke. The sound stage is pretty impressive, too... I actually feel like I can visualize where each instrument was in relation to the mic when it was recorded, even though the speakers are only stereo speakers.All in all, while the surround of a good set of speakers like the SBS560s in a 5.1 setup is fantastic when properly arranged, these speakers are just as good in the sound department and are formidable enough at enveloping you in blissful sound that I'm not going to find it difficult to listen in stereo until my space allows for a surround configuration again, if nothing else.
$SUMMARY.: At first I wasn't sure if I would be happy with these instead of a higher end set...

 I've owned many headphones through the years and none can compete with 595's
 I cannot speak to headphones costing over $500, but in this price range, this is it

 They are very comfortable

 I can listen to them for hours without any discomfort
 They are dynamic enough to listen to an ipod, or use for home theater or gaming


 I have eclectic taste in music, anything from Pink Floyd and Funkadelic to Miles Davis and Keith Jarrett, and they all sound good on these cans

 I listen to these headphones with a headphone amplifier, but they sound great without one as well, so don't worry about that right away.

$review_text.: First, the good news - works without incident on both MacOS X 10.8 (using USB Overdrive to enable the extra buttons) and Windows 7 64-bit.  It's small and fairly light, and tracks accurately (not a given in this day and age).  It's a mouse, and it does mousing well!  It's thicker and wider than many travel mice, which is a plus in my book.Now, the bad news - the power switch on it broke the FIRST TIME I used it.  Luckily, I found instructions online for disassembling this mouse, and was able to rig the power switch so the mouse is on all the time - but that doesn't do much for the battery life.  Speaking of battery life, it's not very good - I have to replace the batteries about every two weeks.  I'm using Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries, but I suspect that the smaller current capacity of the AAA batteries this mouse uses (vs. the AA batteries every other wireless mouse I've had uses) are the main factor in the poor battery life.  (For comparison, most AA-powered mice I have go for two MONTHS on a set of batteries.)

$review_text.: This amp is incredible for the money! It isn't audiophile quality, but it is perfect for the kitchen or a bedroom or any casual listening place. The power supply that now ships with unit works fine. I paired it with a used Airport Express (that I bought for $40) and some spare satellite speakers and, voila! Inexpensive Airplay system for the kitchen! It easily fits in the cabinet with the power supply and Airport Express and delivers plenty of power and good sound. Even if you have to buy speakers, you can build a great sounding stereo AirPlay system for far less than an integrated AirPlay unit.EDIT 10/14/13I liked this setup so much that I bought another one!

My camera's internal memory can be written to faster, of course, and so there does come a time when I might have to wait, but only if I have filled my camera's memory.

$review_text.: This coiled 3.5mm male to male cable works, remains tidy compared to a non-coiled cable, and is very reasonably priced.  I was interested in this cable both to connect my iPhone to the aux-in jack in my car, and to connect a wireless microphone receiver to my camcorder.  Works well in both cases.I wouldn't really call it a 2 meter cable.  If you stretch it much beyond a meter /  3 feet, the tension on the cable might be enough to unplug one end or the other from your devices.  If you really need to reach 6 feet, get a non-coiled 6 foot cable.

$review_text.: The first two paragraphs are me trying to convince you NOT to get this camera. Whereas the last two paragraphs attempt the opposite.don't get itThis is the first camera I have ever bought. I got it back in October of '09 and it has been wonderful. I still plan on using it for years to come. The buying process of an SLR is a tough one. You really need to research them, see what they can do, see what your needs are, and analyze whether it would be a good fit before buying one. Getting an SLR is an expensive decision. They can cost anywhere from 500 to 5,000 dollars (and you'll still need to factor in what lens' you'll want to buy). But I'm sure you already know all of this. What you need to know is whether the XSi will be a good match for your needs.In short, my answer would be no, for just about everyone that's reading this right now. When I bought mine, video recording was still a feature found on the higher end SLRs and it wasn't all that great of an experience. Now SLRs are used to make absolutely stunning works of art using video features. And the XSi doesn't do that. It's a great camera, and I have no regrets in getting mine when I did, because I have been able to capture some amazing memories since then that I wouldn't have been able to if I had waited. I would advise that you spend the extra couple hundred dollars and get one that can make some movies. ISO is also a factor. On more modern cameras in this class you'll see ISO going up to 6400, whereas this one only reaches 1600.do get itThis camera is a great choice for someone who has just discovered their passion for photography. Getting an SLR after you have had a point-and-shoot for years is like going from driving a bike around, to being able to drive a car. And this camera would be an excellent first car. It has many of the luxuries of other higher end cars yet it is still affordable when compared to what else is out there. If you get this camera you will be very pleased with it for the next five years. And keep in mind, it's not so much the camera body that makes great pictures, it's the lens. So if you start to feel limited by the camera, just get a new lens.Since this camera is affordable (compared to other cameras out there) you have room to go and spend a little more on lens from the start. The XSi is a wonderful starting point that will hopefully allow you to expand you photography in all kinds of ways you never considered. So if you're looking for a camera that will give you a good base that you can work up from, with a good value, I'd recommend this camera. The nicer more expensive cameras out there are great, but they still lack things that they should have in their featured features, such as stereo audio recording, more control over video recording settings, and auto-focus during video recording.Either way, just remember, getting a camera is an extremely personal thing. It should fit your needs for now, as well as five years from now. Cause I doubt you'll want to get a new SLR in just a year.

$REVIEW.: I can't add much to what is already written in every other review here.  This is junk hardware of the worst kind.  I am seriously considering dumping DirecTV, after being a subscriber since 1999 (aside from a 1-year diversion to Dish).  Their customer service for this lemon of a device absolutely sucks.  I can no longer trust them to provide reliable service or stand behind their products.This is a disaster.  Do NOT purchase!!!

$review_text.: I was a bit taken back by how BIG this "laptop" really is, but it has handled everything I've thrown at it
From playing Diablo III Beta on full settings to opening up large PSD's in photoshop (while multitasking with other programs), it's handled it greatly


Only thing I changed was adding in one more stick of ram to put it at 16 total
The access panel to the HDD/Ram area is super simple

Just unscrew with a coin, and boom, instant access

One of the better notebook keyboards I've used in awhile too.

$REVIEW.: The "Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera" is a feature rich wireless network camera that was surprisingly easy to setup for both in home viewing and Internet access. I was slightly concerned after reading the detailed steps in K. Lam's excellent review (currently the top review for this product) but now think that it must be dated since the included software took care of all the steps, including setting up the Internet access and free viewnetcam account.The box includes the camera, power supply, various mounting hardware, a security cable, documentation and quick start guides, and installation CD.The initial configuration of the camera requires it to be connected to your router with an Ethernet cable (not included) so it can be discovered by the installation software. Setup is very easy once the camera is discovered, but you must know your wireless SSID and security settings if you are going to use this in the wireless mode (also remember to set the switch on the bottom when finished).Once the basic setup is complete, the setup for remote Internet viewing next. The scary part of K. Lam's walk-through was not needed as the camera software took care of the port forwarding by talking directly to the router and then connected me to the viewnetcam website for registration. Once that was complete, I had my own easy to remember URL for viewing and controlling my camera. Total setup time was about 30 minutes and no calls to the tech support line were required.You connect to the camera via your standard browser (IE 7, Safari, and Firefox worked fine) so no proprietary software is required. The interface allows you to Pan and Tilt the camera and change most of the options by selecting the tabs along the top. It is a fairly intuitive interface and is easy to navigate for even those who do not posses an IT degree.A quick tip, the display resolution defaults to 320x240, which shows a fairly small image in the browser window, this can be changed to 640x480 in the drop down window to show a much large image.Overall, I am very pleased the image quality, ease of setup, and ability to remote view and control the camera.Highly Recommended!CFH

$REVIEW.: I bought this to allow my wife and daughter to view the terabytes of our own digital pictures and movies we've collected.  How else are you going to view them? When was the last time you printed out all your pictures from an event (OK, once in a while I do, but geez, not often).Unlike the cheaper WD TV Play, this one plays my Canon movies in MOV format (H264).  There are sites that show you EXACTLY what both players can handle.  Save your time and just get this one.My Harmony One remote controls this device flawlessly.It turns on when power is supplied. If the power goes out or you flip the switch on your power-strip, when the power comes back on, this player will too. Moreover, it will supply power to any USB drives that draw power from its USB port (as is true in my case).  When I touch the drive it's hot, so the WD TV gives the drive enough work that it can't hibernate.PRO:Plays virtually everything (see WD site for specifics)Compatible with Harmony remotes.CONS:Defaults to power-on state

$review_text.: As a precurser to my review

I have heard earbuds and headphones that range from $100-$300
I'm also comparing them to the $30 UE500 earbuds that I bought
I put these through my normal paces

I add my headphones I've tried over the years to add some weight to what I have heard in terms of sound quality, or lack there of.Headphones: AudioTechnica ATH-M50, Philips Citiscape Uptown, Grado SR80i, Ultimate Ears UE6000 and UE9000.Earbuds: Apple Earbuds/Earpods/In Ears, Bose IE-1, Shure SE-425, Ultimate Ears UE500, MEelectronics M6.So I bought these for a few reasons


I had the UE500, but they didn't fit very well in my ears without foam ear tips, and also didn't stay in the ears very well

I also needed something to plug into AVIOMS for on-stage band situations at my church
The last was because almost everyone in my worship band had these
So I thought, what the heck, might as well try.Sound:I listen to all types of music now a days

Ranging from Hardcore Metal to Rap to Worship to funk


So I need earbuds to be versatile


I can say these earbuds have the most inconsistent sound out of any earbud I've listened to

Sometimes the Treble is too harsh while the bass is perfect, while other times the Bass is too overwhelming and the Treble is very relaxed


I leave my Phone and Laptop EQ off, because I like listening to the music "how the audio engineer wanted"(Beats are terrible Price to Performance
Don't buy them)
I use a Note 2 and a 15" Macbook 2012
Spotify at 320 kbs.Overall, I'd say soundwise, there are better earbuds for the price

I would say to avoid these if you want cheap earbuds for purely sound

I'd go with the UE500, which sound a lot clearer and have a better sound overall
These weren't the reasons I bought them though, so heres to the other part of my review.Fit:These have the over ear design that I wanted


The first time I put these in my ears(default tips) I literally thought they were broken


The sound soudned distant

The more I looked into this on my own, the more I found out it was the earbud causing this


They don't include Foam ear tips, which was a negative for me personally

I literally tried out every tip
Everything I tried, I got the same results

I finally concluded the small tips were the best for my ear

So now onto how well they stay in

They're very good at staying in my ears

They've never just started to come out on its own due to the over the ear design.So my final thoughts


I feel like there are better options for the price when it comes to sound

Fit wise, I'd like to see foam ear tips included, because none but one of the tips fit my ears, which sucks because if I lose them, I'm out of luck.Pros:-Really Good fit-Case is very nice
Can fit earbuds and 1/4 male to 3.5mm Female inside.-"Memory" wire actually stays put even after you take them off.-Long wire-No cable noise(from what I can hear)Cons:-Inconsistent sound.-Plastic housing and Cable that goes into the earbud itself seems that it could break easily.Update(11-19-13):I've now tried the earbuds with a headphone amp

Didn't hear much of a difference with these surprisingly

Fiio E6 with Bass Boost made these sound muddy

The "mid" boost added a little bit to the experience

I also tried them to play video games..

yeah no

They're way too bassy for games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc

It also sucks trying to talk with these on


If you would like to see how I get my headphones hooked up to my PS3, please go look at my review of the Citiscape Uptowns, I write it down in the comments!

$review_text.: I've been using these for the past 6 weeks, for about 1hr, 3 to 4 times a week.They are OK, but I did not like the fixed (but removable) over-ear support. I have removed them and just "attach" the phones around the goggles. No problems here.I like its small size and the soft material used for the earbuds. But sometimes the in-ear detaches from the phone and you cannot easily pull the seal from inside your ear. I do not have long nails so I need to keep simming to finish the laps and then go home to finally remove the seal with a pair of tweezers. This can be very annoying and happens to other waterproof phones as well. The good thing is that if the seal comes off while you are swimming, it floats, so you do not lose them.Nevertheless, they should come with a spare seal for each of the 3 sizes that are shipped.No noticeable issues with the sound quality, which is good, in my opinion. If you are swimming and not listening to a classical piece quietly in your living room, the phones do a pretty good job by keeping water out and by being louder than all the splashing that's going on around you.Good cost/benefit overall.

$REVIEW.: I've become a big fan of Samsung LCD TVs after living with this set for a couple of years.  The LN46C550's image is bright and sharp, with excellent adjustability via a very intuitive settings menu.  What's more, the built-in electronics are very high-quality compared to some other inexpensive/midrange TVs -- the upscaling/interpolation and sharpening of non-HD sources is absolutely first-rate.  I've watched video from a wide variety of sources using analog and digital inputs on this set and I find the image often looks better than it has any right to.  The backlighting is even despite the lack of LED lighting (though it has developed a slight irregularity over a few years of use, a flaw that newer models should correct).  Burn-in is nonexistent.  In short, this is a very high-quality LCD display indeed, especially considering the non-astronomical midrange price It was sold at; Samsung seems like a great deal all around and I'll be considering another one next time I purchase an LCD TV.

$review_text.: The Seasonic power supply has the best packaging I've ever seen for just about any item purchased.  It is almost like opening a treasure of sorts.  Packaging is first rate but better than that this item is built like a tank and always scores in the top of its class.  This power supply is very quiet and extremely stable.  One of the best features is that the PS is modular so you only use the cables needed and there aren't a lot of extra cables to rob your system of airflow. I bought a full size tower so I had plenty of room to route the cables out of sight.  It was one of the cleanest installs I've ever done.  This is one of the best power supplies that you can buy.  I would buy it again in a minute.  One point of caution.  Make sure that your cables are seated properly.  At first my computer wouldn't turn on.  I re-seated he main cable and all was well.

$review_text.: I've been using this router for less than a week.  ONCE you have it set up properly it works great!  This is the second wireless network I've used.  I set up my old Belkin system by myself about two years ago.  In recent months I've had problems with it.  I had two computers hooked up to it via Ethernet cables, and used the wireless ability of my Belkin router to communicate with my old Epson Workmate 600 printer. Recently I got rid of my oldest computer and replaced it with one suitable for my wife to telecommute to her office system via VPN.  What I've recently purchased is a new laptop, one new desktop for my wife to telecommute via VPN to her office server and two new printers (Epson Stylus Pro 3880 for my professional photography, and an Epson Artisan 810 all-in-one printer for documents, copying, and faxing.)... and of course the Cisco SysLink E4200 router.  Initially I only had my newer desktop and laptop hooked up to the SysLink router.  I had no problems hooking up our brand new computer for my wife.  The problem occurred when I loaded my printer software for the Artisan 810 printer in my laptop and the new desktop.  The printer software could not find the printer.  No problems with the pro printer I hooked up via Ethernet.  Anyway, all is well now and my home network works flawlessly!

$REVIEW.: As another reviewer mentioned, this laptop is a powerhouse!The screen is just beautiful, and 11.6 inches is perfect for viewing.The current 9 inch mini netbooks are too far on the small side, for my liking, butthis one straddles the line between portability & pleasant viewing, easily.It's very sleek, very thin, solidly built, though light.Windows 7 is an absolute marvel, erasing those awful memories of the vista experiment.Windows 7 is so intuitive & well thought out, one need not even read the tutorial.This OS blends everything beautifully, leaving a well organized (and easy to get to)list of files & folders.This Toshiba may be more expensive than the current breed of budget netbooks, but it iswell worth the extra money.It does everything so well, from booting up to displaying video, all with a streamlned speed & grace.My only issue is the somewhat flimsy feel of the keyboard.It's nicely laid out, but one is almost afraid to hit the keys too hard.Overall, an excellent addition to Toshba's Satellite family of notebooks.

What I don't like about it is that the fitment seems to be a little off, as if it bulged and actually pushes the clicker below my trackpad upwards so you don't really feel a physical click when using the clicker.

$REVIEW.: I bought this mouse at bestbuy as it was not available on amazon yet. My previous experience with a wireless mouse was not good. I bought it from HP and it came with a charger cradle to recharge the batteries and a disk to download the software. It started to freeze up often, so I replaced it with the original corded mouse.While researching current wireless mice, i was confused as to why none came with a charger cradle. Apparently, the new technology allows a wireless mouse to use a standard set of batteries that last up to two years! This is great. I was looking for a full size mouse as I use this on my desktop and don't need it to be portable for a laptop. The feel is perfect. Contoured sides with rubber grips, the wheel is smooth and the buttons on the side are high enough not to get in the way when you are holding the mouse. These buttons can be programmed to do custom functions. I don't have volume controls on my new keyboard, so I programmed them to control volume up/down. I set maximize screen by pushing the scroll wheel. The USB receiver is small (I guess they call it nano receiver) so if you want to use it with a laptop and leave it plugged in all the time it is very inconspicuous.There is an on/off switch, but it also goes into sleep mode to conserve the batteries. It works right out of the box, but there is software you can download off the Logitech website if you want to customize the button functions, etc.The mouse has worked great and I couldn't be happier with it!

$REVIEW.: Suffers from the same issues of others Chinese branded small routers, good functions but awful support information in classic broken English.Once you find its quirks works great as a router and fine as a repeater (beware, when changing between router and bridge modes, for some weird reason the browser does not update the configuration page automatically you need to do it manually since the available settings are different for each mode), make sure of updating to the latest firmware,Since it has an external antenna its range is better than similar portable routers.For less than 9 bucks I can not complaint.

$review_text.: I've used these Eneloop brand re-chargeable batteries since they first came on the market. They are exactly what they claim to be, always charged. I've found they are fine for cameras, remote controls, GPS units, clocks, radios etc. I always have a few extras around.There are probably other brands of re-chargeable batteries that work well, some may even be cheaper, but I plan to stick with the Eneloops. They've served me well.

$review_text.: I bought this item for mobile charging

 I always found myself getting stuck with a low battery, and this item allows me to get stuck with a low battery anywhere and then recharge it on demand


 I can be walking through the mall charging my cell phone, I can be out in the woods hunting away from my vehicle and charge my phone
 The charger meets my needs, it will charge my cell phone 2-3 times fully on one charge
 Very happy with the quality, appearance and useability of this item
 Small enough to fit comfortably in my pocket

 I also recommend the 3 inch charging cables on amazon (comes in a pack of 3) so that you don't have to carry around a long and bulky charging cable.

$review_text.: UPDATE: 6/6/2011although i don't have the exact details on when i recieved the replacement, i want to say it took one month...it's in my emails and it is unimportant right now.That said, i am very very disappointed with the replacement


Not only did I come out $5.00 more for priority mail to send the memory in for warranty service (tracking number etc) the replacement is worse than the one i gave them! Where i used to get 1 minute 30 seconds video recording at class 4, the camcorder now fails to record for 30 seconds.Class 6 people! Is the maximum my camcorder CAN record...max
This memory is advertised as "class 10" and cannot do 30 seconds at a much lower datarate, pathetic.I will not spend any more money to return this in for warranty


This memory card is downgraded for use in my 10 year old's camera.UPDATE: 3/29/2011Sometime after the original review I lost the memory card (after all it *was* worthless in its current condition), so when Patriot offered to make good on a bad product, I was unable to go through the process
Well, I just found the card this week, as always, when I was not actually looking for it.26Mar2011, per Patriot Memory's request I submitted a support ticket.28Mar2011, I received a reply," I am sorry to hear the issues you are having

We had some issues withour class 10 SDHC cards not functioning correctly and since thenresolved it with a new firmware
We will need to have you send your cardin to be replaced

Also your model camcorder has been tested and we haveverified to work with class 10."29Mar2011, I got around to submitting the RMA


According to the ticket, I should hear back within 48 hours and can expect return instructions.UPDATE: 3/26/2011Since Patriot Memory's comment to submit a support ticket I revisited my original testing and added the following memory chips:-- Kodak SD Memory card (2GB), Class Unknown-- PNY Optima Class 4 SDHCI recorded video within my attention span, averaged three timed events it took save a picture, and averaged three timed events it took for a recording to stop.PNY recorded 8 minutes of error free video, Super Fineaverage picture save time, 6 secondsaverage record stopping time, 6 secondsKodak recorded 4 minutes of error free video, super fineave picture save time, .9 secondsaverage record "stopping" time, 1 secondPatriot record errors, super fineaverage picture save time, 10 secondsaverage record stopping time, 9 secondsORIGINAL REVIEW: November 2010I bought this memory card to use with a newly purchased Samsung F40 camcorder -this memory chip cannot record more than 1 minute 30 seconds in "T.V


Super Fine" or 2 minutes with the camcorder set to "TV Fine"


BOTH eventually give error "Low Speed Card
Please record a lower Resolution"
I have yet to record enough video to error out at "TV Norma"l setting.1) A "Class 10" chip should handle 10MB/s transfer


For those of you unaware, the number following "Class" is the data transfer speed, so Class 2 is 2MB/s, Class 4 is 4MB/s and so on and so forth.2) My camcorder is SD!! Not 720p or 1080p, it is straight up VHS quality "digital" video with a STANDARD TV resolution of 720x480 thus the camcorder ONLY requires the memory to be capable of:TV Super Fine (about 5.0Mbps)TV Fine (about 4.0Mbps)TV Normal (about 3.0Mbps)This memory card is obviously NOT a Class 10 device ---it isn't even Class 4! This cheap plastic material barely pushes past Class 2
I own a $8 generic "Class Unknown" card I bought at Zions Natl Park that performs better than this Patriot LX memory.PROS:You can use it in your digital camera or camcorder


For this, it certainly works.CheapCONS:IF you depend on multiple point-and-shoot pictures or filming for ANY length of time I suggest you look elsewhere.cheap performance

Connects fast and have never had a problem with input or output.2 issues with itFirst, the phone mic is useless. I expected as much considering location and size.Second, sound quality is garbage. The radio transmitter is super weak. It is about 2 feet from the antenna and has terrible reception. It is slightly better when used with the aux in cable (not the one supplied, it is junk). Bluetooth quality is ok when used with aux out to stereo. Seems like has an old bluetooth reciever. Sounds pop whe any bass is used and volume crackles when it gets turned up slightly loud. I have a BT reciever in my personal vehicle and the music streams better than aux cable. I have tried different phones and the sound is always the same.Because of the low sound quality it is overpriced.

$REVIEW.: I live in Oakland, CA.  The antenna will pick up some channels but not without some fussing.  For example, I found that positioning it at seven o'clock will get about 3-4 basic cable channels (and a bunch of crummy local ones) and eleven o'clock will get me 2-3 other channels.  I wish they invented an antennae that captured signals 360 so I didn't have to fuss with the antennae.  Also, if I have guests over, their bodies can interfere with the signal, which is an additional pain.

$review_text.: This is one amazing machine! I love it and use it more than I ever anticipated simply because it's so amazingly capable and portable. I have  other computers, Macs, PCs, laptops, etc. but use this gem almost as much as any of them.Most of the reviews below helped enormously in my choice of the Asus over Acer, HP, and the like. But, I came across some concerns or criticisms that gave me pause too so I wanted to comment on my experience with a couple of them.First, the sound quality. I use Koss portaPro headphones (~ $33 @ Amazon) and have to keep the system and browser volume levels at about 50% otherwise it's uncomfortably loud. The frequency response is excellent up and down the spectrum. No one would really purchase something the size of the Asus and expect the built-in speakers to sound exemplary, would they? Really? Seriously? Get good headphones. They're not expensive.Second, keyboard size. I have hands large enough that I can palm a basketball. They fit the keyboard nicely. You just have to be a bit careful. And practice. Small price to pay.Lastly, this didn't cause me concern but I find it bewildering and it comes up frequently below like it's important.Someone purchases a piece of technology like this. It has about a gazillion times more computing power than NASA had for the moon landing but its form factor is smaller than your average college textbook. To boot, it costs about the same as 11 tanks of gas. With all the technical capabilities contained in that package, at that price, you'd logically expect somebody to take issue with the fact that it shows fingerprints, right? That's like buying a Rolls Royce then complaining because its upholstery shows lint.Yup. Rest assured. The Asus shows fingerprints. My car shows water spots after I drive it in the rain too. Life ain't easy.

$review_text.: I was looking for a walkie-talkie set for an upcoming multi-country trip

 This Midland set came highly recommended by online forums
 It has a nice range (few miles at least) on open terrain

 It won't penetrate the walls of century old buildings in Spain, so you can't be sitting at home and talking to someone who went to the market half a mile away, but it works perfectly fine if you're on the opposite ends of a square, market, park, or a long street.As it was mentioned before, desktop charger does not let you know that it's done charging, but I'm guessing it won't do battery packs any damage if they stay in it a little longer.Headphones that come with it are ugly and hard to wear


 They tend to fall off your ear


 I would much rather prefer a cell phone style headphones with microphone hanging in the middle.Another problem I've noticed is the sudden low battery signal

 I get a decent several days of talking, but the battery indicator always show full charge


 Then, all of a sudden, it starts blinking 'low battery'

 No gradual decline in battery charge like cell phone


 It's either full or low.

Since the lens is so wide and has such a large depth of field, focus isn't much of an issue. My only problem is there seems to be some purple vignetting when shooting on my NEX-7. I can fix it in Photoshop or FCP Pro, so for the money, I don't think there's a better fisheye option. Love the sharpness on this one.

$review_text.: There are tons of good reviews for this headset so in keeping with my normal method, I will summarize a few quick points and then discuss Mac specific issues since no one ever seem to game or use devices with a Mac.  For reference, I use these primarily for gaming but have also used for general movie watching.PROS:- Like everyone says in many of the reviews, this is a really nice headset.  I think sound quality is great and compatibility with everything I have tried so far (PS3, Xbox, PC, Mac, and Iphone) is great and easy.- The headset is very comfortable and I think the quoted 15 hrs of battery life is pretty accurate (maybe a little on the high side, but not too high).- The biggest advantage by far is flexibility which I will discuss more later, but it really is what makes this headset shine in my opinion.- Like many have mentioned, the packaging really is impressive.  Who care about packaging right??  Well, it is just in keeping with the overall quality of the item.  I have not and will not throw away the packaging.  It comes in quite handy.- I have had very little interference after using these for over a month and I have every frequency known to man operating in my house so if interference were an issue, I am sure it would have come up.CONS:- Really the only con is price and yes they are expensive.- I will not really call it a con, but I have had some issues using this headset with Mumble (a 3rd party voice package like Ventrillo, Team Speak, etc).  I think the issue is actually Mumble though.  Mumble seems to "dominate" the bluetooth connectivity so when it is connected (which is continually when I am using), other bluetooth devices (i.e. my phone or Ipad) cant or dont come in.  I think I could probably figure this out, but to be honest, it has not been a real issue so I don't worry about it.Mac connectivity:- Mac users worry not, this headset works easily and potentially in many different ways.  The best option is to just plug the base unit into your Mac via a Toslink cable and the optical audio out.  You will need a specific cable to do this which was one of the very few cables of any type that I did not have.  You need a cable that has a Toslink connection at one end and a 3.5 mm jack on the other or you can use an end adapter (eForCity TosLink Mini Toslink Compatible Xbox 360These can be found in many places.  The audio out port on Macs (at least most that I know of) dual function as a 3.5 mm and optical out.- The only slight downside is once you connect a cable into a this audio out port on a Mac (at least for the optical connectivity), the Mac automatically shifts to that output and can not be switched out by software, i.e. you have to unplug the connection to go back to whatever you had before.  Not a big deal.- Alternatively you could go completely bluetooth in and out from your Mac, but I do not recommend this.  Bluetooth into the Mac (from the microphone) is the only way you get audio in, but the normal and better method for audio out is using the headset stand.-  Bottom line, no Mac issues at all and it was very easy.In summary, I think the quality of this headset is great.  Is it better than your 200W powered sub, bose speakers, and Onkyo receiver??  Of course not, people that expect to compare those systems with any headphones are expecting too much.If you want to test the true value of this headset, play Last of us on PS3 in the dark on a large screen TV with this headset.  It is true audio and visual heaven.

$review_text.: This extender did absolutely nothing to boost my wifi range.  I have a wireless router in the basement which provides plenty of signal to multiple devices in the basement as well as first floor.  However, 1 PC and iPad used on second floor get mediocre signal and low speeds.The TP-LINK paired quickly and painlessly.  I placed it on first floor, right above where the wireless router is located in the basement.  Per directions, 3 bars of strength is enough for this device to do its job.  Well, where I placed it, its getting full signal, however there is absolutely zero improvement in signal strength on my pc and ipad (and cell phones) on the second floor.  There could not be a more perfect &#34;middle ground&#34; spot for this other than where i placed it, but for argument sake, i moved it up to second floor, again directly above the wireless router.  At this location, the TP-Link was getting 3 bars of signal, again per manufacturer enough strength to do its job... Still, no effect on wifi strength or speed (test via speedtest.net) on either the ipad or the PC.  I am getting around 4mpbs with ipad and pc on second floor.  Moving the ipad to first floor increases the speed to 10, so I know there is definitely nothing wrong with the iPad as far as its internal wifi receiver. Moving it back up to second floor, speed goes down to 4 again.  Plugging the TP-Link on first or second floor - still 4mbps on the ipad.  Bottom line, I might just have a defective unit or they aren't as good as people make them out to be in their reviews.

I was astonished at the sound quality of this product. It really does cut out a lot of background sounds and the buds which come in different plug sizes stay put in my ears. I think they were only about $12 which is amazing. I didn't want to spend much on yet another ear set that would just fall out or get broken.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these last year for my wife to use while geocaching.  She was skeptical about it, but after powering her phone literally all day with this pack, she was duly impressed, and now takes it with her everywhere.  Fast forward a year, and I picked one up for myself.  I wanted to use it with the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera, but it does not include the correct adapter.  A quick trip to the local electronics store fixed that.  I am guessing I can probably shoot for a constant 6 - 8 hours with this battery, which says a lot - the BMPCC is a power hungry little monster.
$SUMMARY.: Very impressed with this battery pack

$review_text.: These are really strange headphones. In an attempt to lure buyers into the ML sound, the company has tuned these phones to have perfectly clear, articulated treble that is non-fatiguing. This is hard to do, especially in a headphone, so kudos to ML for that.However, the treble magic comes at the expense of bass, which is minimizied to an unnaturally sounding level. Even symphonic music sounds enervated and hollow, especially older ADD stuff. The new digital recording of Mahler's 9th by Dudamel and the LAPO sounded good enough, and the added detail in strings really made me spot new and interesting elements in Mahler's composition. But then I put on Levine's Brahms symphonies, and they sounded like the bass section was in a different auditorium. Pop and rock sounded even weirder. But acoustic guitar and piano pieces were incredible!Moral of the story; unless you collect headphones, or listen to nothing but acoustic music, these are probably not going to be a good choice. As an alternative to the gobs of bass slathered all over most modern portable headphone tuning, these are a refreshing concept, but most popular music needs more bass than the Mikros 90s offer in order to sound even reasonably close to the recording artist's intent.ML ruins even a qualified recommendation in my case by the fit issue. I have a large head, hat size L, and these barely fit. When crushed down on my ears, the small and oddly shaped driver pads create immense pressure, and the precarious balance of the drivers perched on my ears make them likely to shift into uncomfortable and / or worse sounding positions easily. Definitely not for the big headed. The close fit does at least create considerable isolation from outside noise, but the cord is very microphonic so too much motion when wearing these produces a slighly distracting rustling noise.Making matters worse, the fit and finish on my new M90s was uneven, as the arms racheted out only with a lot of forceful tugging, and one of the arms had some sticky glue or paste on it. Unacceptable for any new headphones, let alone one intended to be a "luxury" model.I'm not taking any stars off for the build quality, as that might have been an anomaly, and I did like the generous accessory kit, especially the compact hard carrying case.The first pair of sub-$150 portable headphones you get should be either neutral (Brainwaves HM5 say) or somewhat bass heavy (e.g. ATH M50) depending on your listening preference. The second pair you get should be whichever of the first two you didn't get, and then if you want a radically different sounding third set, the ML Mikros 90s would be a fine choice, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into. This collection of three headphones will still cost less than the Sennheiser Momentums, will sound better than the ordinary sounding Momentuns across the board (the M50s and HM5s in all ways, the M90s in treble), and will give you some interesting ways to customize your listening.If it was just a question of sound profile, this UnCola of headphones would get 4 stars from me (as long as one is not looking for an all-rounder) but the fit and comfort caused me to take another star off. If you love Segovia and Chopin and little else, and also have a smallish head, these might be worth five stars to you.

$review_text.: All my kids have the galaxy tablet my daughter the 10in my 8yr old son the regular 7in and my 5yr old had this tablet. The poor guy is sick with the flu and he was walking into the kitchen and dropped the tablet. The screen now has lines down it. He has the bumper case on it and it sounded like it barely hit,  the kid is only 3ft tall. Both my other kids have dropped their tablets with no case from higher and no issue. Not to mention how many time i have dropped my note 2. The product is not cheap, if you market it for kids with a "bumper" it should be able to take a 2' fall, in my opinion. I contacted customer support they said i have to send it in before they can tell me if it is covered. I will change the rating based on the results.*Update- Samsung says they will fix it for $160. What a joke. Do not buy this. Do not be fooled by the orange bumper. You even tap this product wrong and the screen might stop working. Any damage to the screen is not covered under warranty bear in mind this is not damage as in a crack or a even a scratch this is the screen no longer displays properly sorry not covered. So one has to wonder what does the supposed warranty cover.My son has been using the kindle fire with no issues dropped it from a shopping cart onto concrete and it didn't skip a beat. Do yourself a favor and don't pay $200 for a product marketed for kids that can't handle any bumps. Unless you want to pay $200 every few months.**Update 2-Zero success with Samsung, even though i reviewed the description of the product and it clearly states "Durable Case Holds Up against Drops and Spills". Samsung would only say sorry once the 3rd party repair company says the product was damaged due to physical damage we can't do anything about it. Which in itself seems questionable but anyway I moved on and was beginning the process to dispute it through my credit card. Then I thought you know this dispute will effect Amazon not Samsung let me give Amazon a chance to make it right. Amazon did and i couldn't be more grateful after dealing with very poor costumer service it was such a relief to know some companies will listen and do what is right. Thank you Amazon.

$REVIEW.: I've bought this set a while ago so I thought I would leave my views on how it held up.First, unfortunately I lost the AC adapter so I can't say much about it.The Zune cable itself worked but it never set correctly into the base port, I could even insert it upside down if I'm not careful


 I'd recommend using it with a Zune dock so any risk of damage is reduced.The car adapter was extremely flimsy and fell apart after being left in the glove box when not used.Overall if you need a quick fix and a spare Zune cable it's not to bad in that regard

 But I also say spend the extra money and get something that is built better.

$SUMMARY.: Okay for a quick fix bundle but I'd look elsewhere.

However, most TVs now have the color codes to match the cords so you'd have to be an idiot to not figure out how it works.  It seemed to take my ipod (classic 160gb) to recognize that it was plugged into the TV, but once it did it was just like I magically put my ipod on the bigscreen.  This is perfect if you want to watch your downloaded movies, video podcasts or music videos on a larger screen.  The sound translated fine and you just do your normal operations from your ipod wheel.  What a bargain!

$REVIEW.: Main thing is that I can't use it well with my speedlight, it doesn't fit (the hole is not big enough for the speedlight head to get in). I made it to work with my Canon Flash (550EX) by tying the flash upside down on the stand with a rubber band (instead of fitting it on the hotshoe).Also the sewing is very flimsy, just opening and closing the umbrella a couple of times makes the stitch come out. I sewed again over the stiches at the tips where the metal(plastic) tips of the frame come out.The light is good though - I think its better than a shoot through umbrella. Wish it had a better build quality!!!!Not recommended if you need to use it with Speedlites (or Speedlights for that matter).

$review_text.: I did have some issues with the drives not working,  I ended up reinstalling the drivers and they all took (Windows 7 Ultimate.  I'm used to XP Pro.).  The other problem I had was that I was left with an open mic and 'What U Hear' was set open so whatever sound was picked up would be echoed in the headset and feedback would build till it was a high pitch tone.  It was a bit confusing trying to find the setting in the Creative Console Launcher.  I had it in Game Mode and didn't realize that you can chance the last three slots manually.  I needed to bring up Microphone FP (Front Panel) and click the speaker to turn it off.  I also set the REC to Microphone FP rather then What U Hear and everything works now.  This isn't a fault of Creative or Microsoft but will hopefully help someone else having the same trouble.The other problem I had was fitting the front panel in a 5.25" drive bay.  The metal seems to have been folded a bit on the wide side and would not fit in my Cool Master ATCS 840 case.  I ended up taking a small hammer and peening the fold so it could fit.  Other then that it wasn't too bad.  I do wish the cables for the FP were longer.  The ATCS 840 is a large case (Full-Tower) and the FP is on the top bay.  The card is on the bottom slot so it's a LONG reach.  It isn't a problem if you run the cables across but there is no way to hide them.  Be aware, the volume control are fine so you'll have to turn it a lot to get it to adjust.  The mic volume controls are also nice since you can adjust it on the fly without having to bother with buried menus.  Although once set you tend not to have to play around with it.  The FP is a glossy black but still looks nice against a black brushed aluminum case.Overall the sound quality is very nice.  It's cleaner then my Audigy 2 ZS.  The CMSS-3D works well and does sound nice, too.  The three modes make for simple presets and the FP allows you to switch them on and off quickly.

$REVIEW.: The Sound Blaster Roar is one of the most perfectly designed portable Bluetooth speaker system with so many extras, it tough to know where to begin. Creative has included so many cool extra functions I realized that I'll never have to have another portable stereo Bluetooth speaker again.These are some of the features that just blew me away.It pairs quickly with the push of a button.The sound is perfect. Absolutely. When I did maximize my phones volume and the Sound Blaster Roar, there was a bit of distortion, but I find this to be a good feature. It gives you the limit of its sound capability - and it is high. There are five drivers powered by two completely separate amplifiers! The bass is very strong and distinct with a built-in subwoofer. The bass comes out the sides and top, the mid-range shouts from the top along with some treble and the highs/treble comes out through two stereo speakers in the front. There is the &#34;ROAR&#34; button which is a booster. Your highs really become pronounced and the bass is slightly louder. The increase in clarity is what really stood out. It's almost overkill.It also works as a speakerphone, which is not unusual but the sound is perfect.There is a miscroSD card slot to store music and it can play MP3, WAV and WMA files. You can probably actually store more music on the card than on your Bluetooth device (32 GB). You can plug this into your PC directly and connect it over the USB and work it as a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). You can play music and charge it at the same time, saving battery power.There is a USB port that will charge a Smartphone, but this drains battery power, unless your unit is plugged into a power source. Easy enough!There is a siren/alarm that is activated by switching the speaker to the &#34;ARM&#34; control. This is part of the overkill, but someone will love this.There is a microphone if you want to record conversations or music/podcasts. To be honest, the sound recording quality of music is not that great, but calls come through great.The &#34;Roar&#34; is like a brick in size (2.2&#34; X 7.9&#34; X 4.5&#34;) and has a high-tech design of black and silver grills with easy to see and use buttons. It weighs about 2.5 pounds but there is a carrying pouch that wraps tightly around it so you don't have to remove it to enjoy sound/music (not included).The functions buttons are all on the top including, Power, Bluetooth/Call Answer/End, Volume Up/Down, and the powerful Roar mode. There is also a three-LED battery indicator light (small green lights) and lights for the Bluetooth and Roar mode.Around the back of the unit gives you a power port for a 3.5mm AUX input (adapter included). This is where the USB port exists for charging and the built-in 6,000mAh battery. This gives you up to eight hours of music, but if you play the Sound Blaster loudly, you will use the power up more quickly. Also, 6,000mAh alone will charge an average Smartphone about 2.5-3 times, so plug it in while charging your smartphone. There is also a small Play/Pause and Forward/Back buttons for songs along with a Record button and a microphone mute for sound recording. Did I mention the Loud Sounds switch, the Alarm arming switch or the Alarm button? It really is a welcome assortment of overkill.If you are going to spend the money for the Sound Blaster Roar, you will get your money's worth. The amount of functions and the audio performance are so well designed and constructed, I don't think anything else is out there that comes close. I am really impressed with this device. It's about time a company designed and produced a great multi-function Bluetooth speaker system that is actually affordable and worth every penny!Product supplied for a fair and honest review.

$review_text.: The other reviews tell you pretty much everything good you need to know about this system.  I used to own the Onkyo SKS-HT500 speaker system with a TX-SR600 receiver, and this system outdoes that one by a mile, on sound alone, let alone the new HDMI connectivity, THX rating, and numerous other state-of-the-art features.  Great sound and fairly easy setup, especially with the Audyssey calibration system.  I'd say this is the best sound you can buy for less than $1,000.Two caveats:-- The box is huge and heavy (136 lbs.) and will very likely arrive quite beat up at your door. Mine was so bad it was scary, but Amazon is offering to replace the subwoofer which got damaged. Luckily everything was else okay.-- Get your own speaker wiring, at least 16 gauge for the surrounds and 14 for the front/mains. The included speaker wires are barely suitable for your bedside alarm clock speaker.
$SUMMARY.: Onkyo does it again! -- The best HTIB money can buy.

$review_text.: Like another reviewer posted, the cable seems pretty cheaply made. The labels/pullers are made from paper with some kind of white backing. When my cable arrived, this backing had hardened and started to disintegrate, resulting in tiny little snow like flakes all over the cable. Definitely do not want to be putting that inside a case. Paid $7.99. Bought a 24" and a 36", both the same. Purchased better quality cables for &lt;$4.00 in the past. Buyer beware.
$SUMMARY.: Poor quality

$review_text.: These are really cool speakers/bulbs that can be tied to your musical devices via Bluetooth that allow you to also manipulate the lights in whatever room you install these speakers in.I placed my speakers in my downstairs living room in the ceiling lights. Be warned that these bulbs are pretty big and don't fit most normal fixtures. I have pot lights in my ceilings so it was easy for me to switch out my other bulbs for these.The sound quality was fantastic and I loved the little light show that also occurred. When not playing music I could also still use the lights in the room which was really cool.One important thing to note is that you have to download an app for this product in order to control the music, lights, and sound via these speakers on your cell. The app was free and it took only seconds to download to my phone. I have an android phone and was still able to download this app so you don't have to worry about it only being IPhone compatible.

$REVIEW.: I have the Urbeats that are made for HTC android phones and lost the small, medium and large tips for them so I needed a replacement and found these. Since they were made by monster I assumed that it would work for my urbeats but they didn't provide the deep bass that I get with the original tips. I really don't know if I'll find the tips I need but I did try these on skullcandy headphones and they did provide a better sound with the gel tips than with the original candy ones so they do work as stated just not for the headphones I need.

$review_text.: I have to say, i bought this product as it was cheap. After rebate i got it for $[...]. I expected it to work in two room apartment and for 6 months. Was thinking of buying a new one after I move to a new place. But its 4 years now and It still works. I get Good signal when i was 30 feet away and with 2 walls in between. I added DLink antenna and i get very good signal for this. I dont get Excellent in the farthest distance. Partly it could be because i have 2 cordless phone of same frequency (2,4 Ghz). With "Very Good" signal, my browsing was easy. Never felt its slow. Im very happy with this product. Setup is so easy. You could save your settings and track who is connected and  bar connections based on IP/MAC and there are many more cool features too. The DLink support was also very good. I had to call them few times to get help in securing my network. I would rate 5. Would definetly recommend it.

After finally reading the reviews about leakage, certainly made me kick myself in the butt. Not only did it leak, but now I have to figure out what got damaged. Motherboard, CPU, Power SUpply, GTX 580 - you name it. Puts me down for a while as well. Don't waist your time with these units. The true story is not being told.

$REVIEW.: I've dealt with pain in my wrist for years. Using this mouse places my hand in the correct position and I feel instant relief from a constant throbbing pain that shoots through my wrist and causes tingling in my fingers.I use the extra buttons to quickly close or minimize windows, and to go forward and backward in web browsers. I add up the seconds this saves me throughout a day and I'm very grateful. Plus it decreases aggravation when I don't have to hunt for the Red X.Everyone comments about the mouse looking futuristic. Takes a few minutes to get used to, so in that sense it keeps people off my computer. But I find the ergonomics brilliant.I ordered my first mouse on February 25, 2011 and it suddenly died last week in August 2013. It was off when I got to work so I replugged it into the USB slot. It works for about 20 seconds then the lights flickered and it shutoff. I tried two different computers and contacted Evoluent technical support. They couldn't offer a resolution, it seemed the circuitry just gave up. I went a few days with a regular mouse but now I'm happy to have my Evoluent VM4R back in my hand.

$REVIEW.: At first, we were disappointed in the plastic feel of the cover, but the reader fits well (has room for the stylus which is a plus because there is no storage on the reader itself)and the cover does what it was designed to do....protect the reader.  We'll see what happens with more use.Since we've had to use clip lights in the past, the flashlight feature in the cover is pretty impressive.One feature that this cover lacks is the ability to stand.  Folding the cover back doesn't work.  We purchased the "igadgitz Black Genuine Napa Leather Book Style Case Cover for Sony Portable Digital eReader" for our pocket reader and, even though it does not have a light, it feels more sturdy and does have the stand feature.  I could not find that they make one for the PRS-T1.Would I buy it again?  I'm not sure.

MY SIGNAL was revieved perfectly on this unit from that distance. And of course, hers hooked up nicely. I also noticed many signls from the hood , all with strong signals. I did go to their website and get the latest drivers but when I went to upgrade them, it said no better driver than the one already installed.No issues, follow the instructions.UPDATE: I got this for my neighbor who has an older G Netgear router. It has trouble downloading from the G router. I can connect to my N right across the street, no problem. Speeds on the G are around 4-5 with the speeds, when connected to my router, are 15. I have the latest drivers. Perhaps going back to old ones might help. I'll just get her a newer N router. No need trying to make old equipment work.Still very happy with this product. Hope this helps.

$REVIEW.: In a nutshell: this calibrator was easy to setup, and the whole process took about 20 minutes from start to finish.Who is it for?First, the camera being calibrated must have Auto Focus Micro Adjustment capability.Second, the lens' Depth Of Field is shallow (f/2.8 or less) which exacerbates focus errors.The process is relatively straightforward: you set your lens to its max aperture; setup this calibrator and the camera such that both are level, and that the lens is aimed squarely at the center of this chart; use a distance that is about 25x the focal length between the two; and fire some test shots at different AFMA settings until the focus is cleanly on the 0 point of the ruler.A few tips:1] use a tethered setup with Adobe LR. The magnifier tool on the camera while workable, was much harder for me.2] For zoom lenses, this is complicated by the fact that most cameras only support a single AFMA setting per lens. So, calibrate the focal length that you use most often.3] Using B&W; photos rather than color made it easier to detect edgesHappy photography!~A_E~

The actual product, according to the manufacturer, is closer to 50 inches at the maximum dimensions. Some citations indicate 48 inches while others list 50 inches. In either event, in a community with an HOA that limits antennas to a maximum of one meter (roughly 39 inches), the actual specs make the product unusable. I am not giving the product one star, as I imagine it is well constructed. However, people really must take note that the listed specs appear to be far from the actual specs.

$REVIEW.: Unlike other pocket radios, e.g., those offered by Sony and Grundig, the Sangean's tuner is digital, with no drift. Once tuned, a station remains tuned. The internal speaker is large enough to deliver sound without distortion even when the volume dial is rotated to the maximum setting. The built-in earphones deliver amazing stereo quality, and the 3.5 mm earphone jack also accommodates external devices such as two battery-powered Altec Lansing music speakers (also offered on this website) linked with a 3.5 mm splitter cable (two females, one male. If you own a Sangean PR-D5 radio, try comparing its sound with that of the DT-220A/double Altec Lansing combination, and then play the same station on both simultaneously, one on each side, with the volume equalized, for a simulated and highly realistic concert experience.

Somehow when I tried copying files onto the drive, the speed got reduced to 0


Strange problem
But then after day one, it's working OK


Stable speed, at 90-100MB/s


I'm not a fan of the design, but you can't beat the price of this product.

$REVIEW.: EDIT: Get the clear version of this screen protector. It's excellent, especially for the price. I haven't seen any problems with touch sensitivity. The one complaint I have is that my fingers didn't track smoothly over the plastic when it was first installed. It wasn't slippery enough, in other words. However, after extended use, the protector becomes more slippery.Once again, great customer service! I really feel that Anker goes above and beyond for its customers.--------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW: The matte version of this screen protector noticeably decreases the touch sensitivity of my Nexus 7 FHD. I'd say that it makes the Nexus miss about 20-30% of screen taps, especially ones from the edge of my thumb. That being said, Anker does provide amazing customer service, and they refunded me immediately due to my dissatisfaction.

$REVIEW.: I bought this as a replacement for a Polk 10" DBi DVC subwoofer
The Polk made a ton of cone noise which drove me crazy


The polk also was far less flat in its response curve

(The polk did well at 50Hz, but it rather sharply dropped off above or below by 15-20dB
This sub sounds brilliant, has no noticeable cone noise, and the price is amazing! I have 0 complaints
It hits harder and cleaner by leaps and bounds
It's much flatter in its response, has a higher sensitivity (94dB vs the Polk's 86dB) which means that it sounds great even at low volume.I should note, that using the included foam "ring" improved my sound quality immensely

Apparently a small amount of air was escaping out of the box where the sub screws into the box

This sealed the box, and the difference was night and day! I 100% recommend using this foam "ring".



$SUMMARY.: Sounds great - huge improvement over Polk DBi 10"

$REVIEW.: I am sad that Sony is no longer in the PDA business.  This is one of the best PDAs of its time.  I've had it for several years and still use it.  It combines all the features I need, plus more.  The keyboard is the main reason I purchased it- very easy to use and illuminates.  I also love the ability to check email and surf the web, snap quick pictures, read files, and listen to music and audiobooks.  The battery life is not the best, but there are lots of accessories and there is an extended battery.  It comes loaded with applications and games.  The screen is a nice size.  I still get questions and compliments on it!

$REVIEW.: Excellent and efficient digital power supply.  I had a AX760i and that was a great unit also but I went with SLI and wanted to make sure I right-sized my power demand and delivery.  The Corsair Link software is useful for monitoring your consumption and efficiency.  I am running a mildly overclocked 4770k, overclocked dual SLI 780 Ti Classified Duals, 8 fans, 6 SSD's and it hasn't skipped a beat.  Haswell-compatible and handles all the power saving and management features properly.The fan has never even turned on yet and highest temps recorded on the PS were 40C.  I turned the fan on in Corsair Link briefly to make sure it worked and everything is fine.

$REVIEW.: After trying to set up a couple other cameras this is just a no-brainer &#8211; just join your network and you're done


 I consider that zero configuration
 The camera itself is just well-designed &#8211; easy to tilt forward and backward and rotate

 The video quality is good &#8211; it doesn't seem to be crystal-clear HD like I get from my iPhone but it's good enough

 I got the camera to watch my dog while I'm at work but it's also really nice to have the monitor available for things like deliveries, knowing if my roommates are home yet, watching the maids, etc

I also have a dog walker and it's easy for me to review what time he took the dogs out and what time he returned.The only bummer is the price &#8211; if this were $99 I'd say it's a perfect product
It's more than double the price of most IP cameras so it's extravagant but the easy set up for me was worth it.

$REVIEW.: As other reviewers noted, this is better than Garmin's suction-cup mount.  For one it has the adjustable flex point and 2 it is overall larger allowing the GPS to be further away from the windshield.  Bonus that it is also 1/2 the price of Garmin's and this is a win-win.Only minor gripe is the ball the bracket connects too is just slightly smaller than Garmin's, so the GPS tilts easier, like when pressing firmly on the screen (which is required since I don't have one of the glass cap-touch models).

$review_text.: Read most of the other reviews and took a chance. Really wanted the wires off the floor and wanted faster speed then wireless for Wii and streaming movies, music and You Tube to my entertainment center. The house was built in 1984 and is single story. The office where the router is and the entertainment center power are on different circuits.From opening the box to up and running took 15 minutes and 10 minutes were in moving some furniture. There was no software to install, no configuration, it was truly plug and use. This product could not have preformed better. It was a little pricey, and there are cheaper ones out there, but this was worth every penny! Many of the less expensive ones had a greater percentage of dissatisfied customers and I needed all four ports this had for TV, Sound/Blue Ray, Wii, Videoconferencing.Did not need to call Netgear about set up so I can't testify about their customer service. Also not sure of multiple floors, but it definitely crossed circuit breakers in the electrical panel. Distance from plug in office and entertainment center is 40'.

$REVIEW.: I bought this tuner about a year ago and rarely used it

I was disappointed to find that it didn't work at all with cable tv! I'm still confused

I have Cox Cable and even without a cable box, I'm still able to get channels 1-100 on a non-digital tv just by having the analog cable plugged in from the wall


With this tuner, I got no channels at all
I even tried connecting this to the output on my HD cable box and still got nothing


The tuner worked ok for digital ota broadcasts but that is not of use to me..

I pay good money for cable..

what good is 15 free channels on my computer?! Another issue was I had was I could only get this to work with Windows 7 64bit

The drivers installed automatically

However, I was only able to get this to work with Windows Media Center (so the remote wouldn't work)

The Pinnacle software was junk and always crashed

I tried to install this tuner on a XP MCE laptop and Vista 32bit desktop and neither worked


The computers claimed the device was working (device manager showed it installed and working) but whenever I opened Media center it said "no tuner found".

It is very convenient while traveling.Con:The built in cable could be a millimeter longer, its a little bit of a tight fit snapping back into the body.The material could be a little softer.

A cordless keyboard is supposed to allow me to get away from my desk.  I don't look at the keyboard.  And with this one, I get stuck with pressing the up arrow key when I want to shift.  This is just wrong.  It breaks my concentration and wastes my time having to focus on the tool and not the thought.  What were they thinking?  Logitech didn't do this to the K810.  If you touch type, think about this before you purchase.  A keyboard shouldn't cause this much aggravation.  (I have the K810 and love it.  It just doesn't have the built-in touchpad.)

$review_text.: Good lens are expensive and when people find a nice piece of glass for cheap the buzz goes around
Many time that buzz is spread by people who have never owned or used the lens

It becomes automatic assumption that because it is a 50mm prime, it should be great
Don't believe the hype.The first buzz about this lens is its advantage to the Nikon equivalent because this lens will AF with all the Canon Rebels DSLR
Just be ware that the AF on this lens is horribly inaccurate so you will end up having to manual focus anyways, and that is a pain because of the design of the AF ring.The second buzz about this lens is that it is great for low light photography because its f1.8 max aperture
Just be aware that this lens is useless at f1.8, it is soft and flat in color, and I mean it


 This lens becomes useful only after f2.8 so the whole low light advantage is only a myth.To be honest, I have gotten better and sharper results from the camera kit lens and for that I would caution you to spend your money wisely on a different lens.

$review_text.: There are more reviews that indicate issues with this software that there are success stories. I received my copy of Creator NXT 2 as part of the Amazon Vine program and upon receipt started to load the software into my fairly new Gateway PC. I already had Creator NXT on the PC thus when I started loading a window indicated I would need to remove the older version. The software would not work on my Mac. The loading was not difficult however it di take several minutes.I opened the Creator NXT2  and started to work with it. I should have opened one of the help chapters (there are five) before I started the project. In addition to the five chapters of help there are  additional help sections on the internet. You can access those by opening the software and the help chapters immediately pop up.I started with a simple project, editing some photos I had and I fund the program to be fairly good and easy to manipulate. The photo editing turned out well. I have nom yet gotten into movies or videoI still have lots of learning on this software however at this point I am well satisfied. The package indicates there are several new sections to this software over the previous Creator NXT edition. These being up to 10 times faster video rendering, new and enhances music libraries, faster audio conversion and sharing to more devises.While I don&#8217;t use a lot of the features of this software very often I am pleased to know I have it available and with a  little practice I should be able to get some good results out of this software

$review_text.: I was very satisfied, astonished even, to open the box and see such a beautiful machine.  There is none other of its kind, really.  Thin, light, yet a 17.3" screen that can still perform at near top tier.  This is an excellent computer that's ready to tackle any task.  I am a moderate gamer, but also model 3D objects through Computer Aided Design.  In order to run CAD programs efficiently, you need a great processor, enough memory, and a pretty darn good graphics card.  On top of all that, a big screen is also preferable.  This laptop provided it all, everything my previous laptop could not.  You can tell that I am very enthusiastic.  Well, that's because I can actually get work done on this laptop without getting interrupted by the laptop itself.The only flaw is the responsiveness of the fn commands.  I find myself a little embarrassed sometimes when some sort of audio suddenly plays and, because the volume was previously set at high and there's a significant delay in trying to lower the volume through the fn command.  It is the same issue when controlling brightness through the fn command.  It could just be the one I have, but nonetheless, it is the only complaint I have.

$REVIEW.: In the hierarchy of Nikon cameras, the D200 now becomes an affordable pro camera at an entry level price on the used market. If you are coming prom a P&S; the flexibility will astound you. BUT, there are some things you need to know. The CFstorage cards these run on are antiquated and sometimes hard to find. Newer laptops and desktops won't have card slots for them. There is no auto popup flash. You will have to turn it on and set it up. It is a much larger body then the 3000-5000 series and is not made of plastic. It has a good solid feel to it. If you want to take control of your picture taking, instead of always shooting in autothen this is the camera for you. Try and get one with a low shutter count and Nikon battery. There are plenty of them out there like this.

BS I am stationed in Afghanistan with the Military, I have had the product for 3 weeks, fist off they won't charge correctly, instructions say 2 hours and they will be a steady Green, NOPE flashes green during the whole time, Second..Supposed to be sweat proof, hince the reason I ordered them, so i could work out with out the cords and no worry bout the fact that when you train in a gym in the desert with NO A/C you sweat


OK guess what They stopped responding to the buttons after the 1st week, second week, they jammed and some how were caught in a Loop, turns itself on and trys to Pair with my Ipod, then shuts down, starts up and does the same thing, coulndt get it to stop had to wait till it killed itself on the battery before i recharged it and tried again, worked fine for the first 30 mins of my work out, but then it just shuts it self off, I turn it back on and it has to be re-Paired with my Ipod, then it starts skipping on the music


Like a scratched CD..3rd week the buttons dont work half the time, conintues to shut down and now its flashing PURPLE...and then goes steady half purple half red...Which isnt even listed in the instructions...DONT PURCHASE...its a waste of money

and the return policy dropped dead before i even recieved the unit

$REVIEW.: You'll spend a bit more on a RAM mount, but it's well worth it.  This mount is made of *metal*. I was surprised and pleased at how robust it is.  It fits my Galaxy S3 very securely; in fact, the only I can find is that it's a two handed operation to insert the phone.  But once it's in there, it's there to stay.The ball-and-socket design is NOT what you're expecting if you've never seen a RAM mount.  It's not like the cheap plastic ones that you've probably seen;  once you tighten down the &#34;wing nut&#34; on the mount, it won't move ... not even if you want to adjust it ... you'll have to loosen it first.Note that you'll need a base and arm to complete this kit ... this is NOT a complete mount, it's only the &#34;cradle&#34; that holds your phone.  Personally, I prefer to screw the mount to my dash, rather than rely on suction cups and such; I am using RAM-B-138U, and am very pleased with it, as well.It's nice that the mount isn't phone-specific ... it'll work for my wife's iPhone, and I imagine all but the very largest smart phones.

$REVIEW.: This is really awesome! If you know Bose you can't go wrong


If you have never heard Bose before you are missing out.The Solo TV sound system has a bit larger footprint than I expected (20  x 12  x 3) but it is a cool looking system; all black with subtle curves and weighs just 10 lbs


It is sturdy enough to actually sit the TV on it (up to 40 lbs, see manual for exact size and position)
It comes with a power cord, analog and optical cables and remote.While it does not come with a coaxial cable (it does for Europe per the manual) I used the analog cable to hook it up to the coaxial on our inexpensive 20 inch TV and it sounds great! I also tried the optical on our cable device and it also sounds great


The manual lists optical as better then coaxial but you'll find many people argue that and personally I can't tell much difference if any


They both sound great to me over the built in speakers on any TV

You will want to mute the internal speakers of your TV - they'll only be in the way.If you have music channels it also serves as a great sounding music player
I've been listening to music as I write this and it sounds so good - wow!The remote is simple with On/Off, volume and mute controls but has the Bose quality look and fits perfectly in your handThe Bose Solo TV sound system will enhance the sound of any TV

It is very easy to setup, has a great footprint, lightweight and only requires the power and audio cables
But most important it greatly enhances that bland sound coming from your TV!

$review_text.: The problem with this model is that the insert hole for the headphone jack becomes rusted after about 6 months use and you lose sound in one of the ear pieces
Perhaps because I only use them outdoors
Because of a lack of good quality products I have wasted money on 4 of this same model

For every one the same thing happens.When you plug the headphone in the hold it does not give a solid reception and breaks off
This is about the most annoying thing for a runner
 I upgraded to the Sony "water resistant" model and sure enough the same problem
 After a few months only one ear has sound


Everything else about this model is fine
However after wasting my money on four I decided to find a new model.

The dual core processor is pretty speedy, I can't tell the difference between this computer and any other faster laptop. I just ordered a memory upgrade from Crucial, so that's going to improve any lagging performance. But I seriously don't notice it.What's all the gripe about in the other reviews about Win 7 Starter? It meets my basic needs just fine. If you're a big ol' computer nerd, I guess you'll need to upgrade the Windows software. But for the average Joe, this netbook will do just fine.Other than that, this computer is sweet. It definitely blows the pants off the cheap Acer laptop that just broke on me. Piece of junk!

Just overall the better choice - what more can I say..
 Although, with the nano and it's small size - the leather ends up being so thick near the control wheel that it's a little hard to hit the bottom of the wheel - where it so happens is the off and on button..

but I'm really splitting hairs - compared to it's other benefits...

$REVIEW.: I bought it w/my 70D in Feb 14 for a trip.  The grip fit fine and did what it was supposed to for the most part.  At first I had two minor gripEs. 1. The shutter button was a hair-trigger. Even a casual touch would lead to unwanted shots. However I don't know how that compares to the Canon grip. 2. The lettering near the buttons rubbed off almost immediately.Still I used the grip, keeping it on the 70D in fairly heavy usage when I use my large telephoto with its tripod mount.  Since I shoot on a monopod, it's really helpful to have that 2nd shutter button where I can press it w/o curling my arthritic hand around the camera.  The other day I was in the field and suddenly the 70D's main dial would not dial in F stop, shutter speed or whatever it was supposed to in the selected mode(that's the dial atop the camera near the shutter ).  I thought my 70D was out of whack, but I realised that this behavior would occur only when my Neewer grip was powered on.  Power off and operations ok.  I tried battery pulls, power on-off, etc, no luck.  The following day, it arbitrarily; started working again.Bottom line is that  I finally bit the bullet and bought the Canon grip today. It was 175.00(I thought is was more a few months ago). I don't regret giving the knock-off a shot, I got 4 months out of it, but I feel the extra money is worth it if it buys more reliability.(If I find the Canon grip does the same thing....I RETURN IT!!)

Ubuntu recognized the card right away [although I already had the ATI driver installed through Control Center for the mother board ATI card] Windows 7 installed the appropriate driver automatically, I didn't use the provided disc. Currently it's hooked to a 21.5" eMachines LCD monitor through VGA and a 42" Panasonic plasma through a 50' HDMI. The only inconvenience, that I have to manually switch back and forth the sound output depending if I want to listen to the sound in the office through the built in audio card or the surround sound through the HDMI cable in the living room. I've tried to split the original VGA output with a booster and splitting the stereo out, but I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the picture and the living room sound had an annoying buzz.This card fixed this issue, plus I'm able to have true surround sound and even have a nicer, more natural picture on the 21.5 LCD than with the factory video card.Great bang for the buck!

However, when dust gets in there its pretty much impossible to clean out

So use a compressed gas duster every couple of days to keep the vents clean


The base has legs which pop out and clip back in, but even when in, the shape is curved
So it doesn't fit flat in your laptop bag


Make sure to have the space for it.

$REVIEW.: Ahh, where to begin?  The WC-DC58B is a wonder to behold.  The quality, look, and feel of this lens at first sight impressed me greatly.  I was immediately seduced.  It had the same effect on my wife.  After using this lens now for a few weeks on the Canon PowerShot a650IS I have both positive and negatives to relate.  (If you intend to use this lens on the G series Canon Cameras some of the details may differ or not apply... for example the focal length.)The good:* Excellent construction quality* Inexpensive compared to a high quality wide angle SLR lens* Comes with a lens sack and two plastic lens covers that fit easily and stay snug on the lens* No perceptible degradation of image quality compared to pictures taken without the wide angle lens* The camera becomes quite impressive with this lens, however you no longer will look discrete when taking pictures :-)Quite a few Cons:* Quite large and heavy,  it is a bit of a juggling act to carefully screw this to its adapter and then attach it to the camera when you are in the "field".  Luckily with a lot of attention while doing this I have not dropped anything (See the images I posted for a look at the parts and sizes).* The Canon documentation for the a650is says to only use this lens on the camera's wide end setting* You have to buy the separate adapter to attach it to your camera* The closest focus distance is about 12" (1 foot) on the A650IS* The lens blocks the optical image finder and the flash.  This makes the lens less than optimum for indoors use unless you buy the external flash unit.* Wide angle but not so wide as to be dramatic:  This lens gives a 35 mm Film wide angle equivalent focal length of 26.8mm on the Canon PowerShot a650IS.  This is on the minimum side of being a wide angle lens and not quite as wide as I would have liked.  This was probably a trade off Canon made between increasing the lens size even more and limits on image degradation for this add on converter lens.* Canon documentation says that there are no attachment provisions for filters or hoods.  You can make do by providing an improvised shade/hood.  I haven't had the need to add a filter yet so I haven't investigated any work-arounds.* When used with the a650IS you must remember to set up the camera for the lens in the menu and when taking the lens off you must remember to reset the menu.  This is easy to forget when you are in the middle of taking pictures; I have forgotten several times.In summary:  I bought this lens to use outdoors.  If you need/want to take shots with extra wide angle perspective and don't need to take them indoors with poor lighting (or you have the external flash or will buy the external flash unit) then this lens is a high quality addition to your camera.

It just works. It is a generic brand so warranty is non-existent, but the product works so happy thus far. The generic no name no warranty is why it didn't get 5 stars.

$review_text.: This is my 2nd Zune 120 and this is one guy who couldn't be happier
I had a problem downloading the software but was able to get live help and we had it up and working in less than 30 minutes


I find the software and the Zune easy to use and I'm 58 years old!!!! So what's the big deal with a couple fingerprints on the case

Buy some Windex!!!! I got several docks (one for my PC, one for my Stereo and one for the radio at work) and 2 car kits

Canceled my XM radio, put away my cds and I'm enjoying listening to the music I want to hear!!!!!April 26, 2013 Update
I'm now 62 and it's been over 4 years since I purchased this, my 2nd Zune 120 GB player and both are still working perfectly
I have over 1000 albums stored on them, thousands of photos and their just over half full
They are used every week for hours
Could not be Happier
I'm more concerned about longevity than having all the latest bells and whistles and have no need to buy a new device every few months, but then I OLD (you can probably tell because I said Albums) and not easily impressed by the latest Gimmicks..

All I need is for it to play My Music....

$review_text.: There's nothing I have found that it won't play on max settings. Granted, I haven't tried Crysis 3, but Metro LL, Skyrim, Tombraider, Black Flag, Witcher 2, Batman Origins, the list goes on, it plays without even straining. I haven't tried overclocking it yet; haven't needed to.No issues with installation or compatibility, either. It is what it's advertised. If you're looking for a cheap card that will allow you to happily game through current games with excellent graphical superiority, look no farther. They have excellent customer support as well.Which reminds me... The only issue I had was with the gamma bottoming out at certain times when what was being displayed was particularly dark. Such as in a cave, basement, a few menu screens, what have you. I'm not sure what it is, but it does have a pretty simple solution. I'm not sure if the fault lies in the monitor or the card, but either way, if you're having this problem just switch the monitor preset to something else or customize the levels until the problem goes away. Doesn't require you to have a washed out picture to accomplish or anything- don't worry. I just used one of the other, arguably better looking, presets on my monitor and have not had any trouble. Thanks to the EVGA customer support for helping me figure that out.Great productASUS LGA-1150 Z87-PLUS MB8G DDR3 CORSAIR RAM2G EVGA GTX760 SS VCINTEL i7-4770K 3.4GHZ

$review_text.: This car charger is marketed for the iPhone or iPad, since it comes with an Apple dock connector charger, but the reality is that it will charge a variety of devices that can otherwise be charged via USB.This means that it will charge your kid's Nintendo DS with a cable you can buy off of ebay. It means that you can charge your android handset if it has a USB charging cable available (they pretty much all do). It means that you can charge your Blackberry. It means you can charge your bluetooth headset. I would guess (but haven't verified) that it will charge your GPS. I have noted another review that pointed out that while they also had luck getting it to charge other devices - it would not charge their Creative mp3 player - which is surprising - but perhaps it draws more power than the 10 watts this device delivers - so perhaps it won't charge everything - but the things I tried (with the exception of the GPS - don't own one) all worked.This is why this is such a great device to have in your car. It is low profile, with the top of it just sticking out enough in your cigarette lighter/accessory power port where it can be easily grasped by it's edges (a thoughtful design touch) if it needs to be removed (I haven't done this once since owning it).The included Apple sync cable is a decent quality - most certainly a good deal better than your usual cheap 3rd party cable purchased from ebay. The plastic cable cover is made from a different material as Apple's (it is a little more grippy) but that is not a complaint. Certainly, you can use your current sync cable if you prefer.Due to it's high power output - it is one less thing to think about. It just works. I am quite pleased with it for this reason.

Selected this one based on size and price

For a 6'2&#34; person this tripod is just right for my height

Very capable for the price

Not giving five stars based on how tight and somewhat problematic it is to adjust the angle of the camera platform
 Hoping it gets easier after it &#34;breaks in&#34; at which time I will revisit my review.

$REVIEW.: This backpack has plenty of pockets and space to fit just about any of your electronic needs


I store my 15 inch computer, my pad, my flash drives, books, drink containers, and just about anything I would need throughout a normal work day

The only complaint I have is the lack of, somewhat non-existent, padding on the bottom of the bag
When your computer is in the bag and you place your bag on the ground the only thing protecting the edge of the computer is the thin layer of bag material
So be careful of this if you purchase the bag


Other than that I do not have any complaints


Great bag, just wish it was a little more padded.

$REVIEW.: I am using the drive in RAID 1 configuration so I have 500 Gb of redundant storage. Set up was easy. It is attractive. The light around the power switch is alittle over-kill. It attracts a lot of attention rotating and pulsing. It tells you how much of it is full and what its doing. When I first starting using it I noticed it was alittle noisy. It ran nearly continously. Then, perhaps after I did acouple reboots to install updates in Windows, it stopped making the noise and hum. The software works well. It is backing up my computer's hard drive every week. I like it.

$REVIEW.: Do you wonder why the FP1 price has dropped to $79 from about $109 in the past 3 weeks ? (What was it a couple of months ago, about $169 !! )  I think I know why.  I tried two different ones, and both have terrible glare on the lens and the glare has the same effect as if you were in a smoke-filled room !! This is true indoors, worse of course outdoors, and even is very visible in its videos. Its pictures look as though they need a polarizing filter...And if that weren't enough, the low-light ability w/o flash is just pitiful. So very disappointing compared to what I expected from Panasonic.  Ok for $79, but it never should have started any higher.All its pretty bells and whistles and durable body cant help.

$REVIEW.: I should preface this review by admitting that I'm not generally a big fan of earbuds for music-listening. Over the years, I have been buying more full-sized and portable headphones for my listening....but there is something to be said for the tiny size of earbuds. So, I have bought a few sets of earbuds in recent years. When paired with my Sansa Clip+, I can literally keep my entire system in a small pocket.These Polk Audio earbuds have really impressed me not only with their sound quality, but their comfort. The sound is rich, clear and very nicely-balanced. Of course, the bass response will never match those of larger diaphragms, as found in headphones, but you can't have everything. As far as earbuds go, i don't think I've heard better than these.They came with several different sizes of ear cushions, which is great for tailoring to one's own ear canals.Also, I don't own an iPhone, so I can't speak to the iOS connectivity.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent sound and comfort
