$review_text.: I was running out of ports on my Wireless Router.  It only has 4 ports and I now needed 5.  I was told this would solve my problem and it did.  While I was listening to Pandora on my Roku I unplugged the cable to the router and then placed this switch between the router and the Roku box.  Within a few seconds Pandora was playing again with only missing a few notes.  Truly plug and play!! Pun intended.  I love this box.

$review_text.: My first SLR camera and I was skeptical at first but after shooting my first 50-100 pictures I'm a canon lover for life.  There was an initial learning curve on the camera, dozens of features and settings were intimidating and took lots of practice to finally get the desired results.  Also purchased a 75/100mm lens to compliment the 18-55mm lens.  I shoot everything from my son's pee-wee football games, to my daughter's dance class, to family vacation photos.  The shots are simply amazing.  Great depth, clarity, color, focus, etc.  I'd like to claim credit for the pictures, but honestly the camera makes me look like a pro.  I'm glad I purchased this camera.  My wife has fell in love with the camera also.

$review_text.: I admit I didn't have the highest expectations for this keyboard simply because it was so inexpensive.  Bluetooth keyboards can easily go for twice what I paid for this, and I had expected the quality to be linked.However this is an absolutely killer keyboard.  It's got a good feel to it, the keys solidly click down as I type, they don't require much pressure, and it is as light and as thin as I expect a well made keyboard to be.  It's a bit smaller than my laptop keyboard, but the spacing of the keys make it very easy to get used to.If you're looking for a nice keyboard for your ipad or whatever, I highly recommend this one!

$REVIEW.: Pros:LED light lets you know it's working (nice touch - really)USB cable is attached and part of the device (hard to lose)Solid feel, fairly long cable (five feet)Nice fold down plug in prongs (slightly easier to store)Can be used with most small devices with micro and mini USB portsCons(iderations):Slightly underpowered (500 MA amperage - see below) - smaller devices onlyCan't be used with most modern Apple devices (iPads and iPhones)__________________________________________________________________________USB wall chargers will have two "Output" values clearly printed on them, albeit in really tiny letters. This charger is listed as:Output: 5.0 VDC / 500 MA (5.0 volts Direct Current / 500 milliamps)That means 5.0 volts of direct current and 500 milliamps ("rate of flow"). This is exactly the same as my factory USB charger for my Blackberry Curve cell phone. I use this as an extra charger for my Blackberry at work.Before getting an extra, or a replacement, charger for your device, check the output values listed on your existing charger, or check the documentation for the device you will be charging. You can't go wrong if you purchase a charger with the exact volts and amps as indicated (though higher amps is OK - see below). The output of 500 milliamps is fairly common for many cell phones. The 5.0 volts DC is also pretty common for a lot of devices.If your device requires a charger with higher amperage, such as an Android tablet, this could still charge it, but at a lot slower rate. Say you have an Android tablet which normally uses a charger rated at 2.0 amps. When you use this to recharge it you'll probably need to do it overnight at least. But it will work. If you need/want a more powerful USB charger check out theAmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet( 2.1 Amp Output). That charger does NOT come with an attached USB cable - it's just the wall wart. If you don't own one, you'll need to buy the appropriate USB cable and correct size USB connector for the device you want to charge. With the right cables, the 2.1 amp wall charger can be flexibly used with more devices.You can ALWAYS use a wall charger with higher amperage than your device requires. Devices PULL the amperage they need, so if your phone requires a 500 MA charger and you have a 2.0 amp charger, the extra amperage won't hurt it - it will just be there for extra capacity. Too much amperage is not a problem.Make sure to ensure that the device port into which you will plug the charger is the correct size. This specific product comes with a standard micro USB cable already attached, with the (also standard) micro to mini adapter. This means that for the vast majority of non-Apple products (their tablets and phones use weird 30 pin USB connectors) you'll be able to plug this charger in to them pretty easily.This is a a solid device, 5 stars because it does what it's supposed to do. I will update and annotate over time if it turns out durability is an issue (if it breaks or falls apart I will post an update).

$REVIEW.: This is a great portable battery/charger that can double or triple your time spent away from a wall charger

With a honkin' 3400mAh capacity, it is capable of recharging most smartphones (2x ~1500mAh) twice and hungrier tablets perhaps once


The LED readout on the battery allows you to quickly determine how much battery power remains, or how much longer the battery needs before it is fully charged


Think of it less as an "emergency" charger but instead as an extended battery for anything that charges or can be powered by USB


Pair it with a solar charger for the ultimate in geek chic and road warrior capabilities.* Battery outputs to a standard USB "A" port (rectangle)* Charges via "mini" USB (trapezoid-ish shape)

$REVIEW.: This review is mostly about the seller, BetterStuff LowerPrice, but at this time they are the only seller of this camera on Amazon.The software CD was broken when the camera arrived, which can happen from time to time, but it looked like it was hit with a hammer a couple of times, so it was probably broken before it was packed as it didn't look like that would have happened during travel.The manual indicates that the operating software can be obtained online, but the page it directs you to only lists software for other cameras that is a couple of years old, which is older than this camera design.The seller's website has broken graphics and looks as if nobody has tended to it for a long time. That doesn't engender a lot of confidence.I emailed the seller a couple of times, beginning as soon as the camera arrived and they haven't responded.The lights on the camera worked and it made clicking noises once in a while, so at least it wasn't dead. But my computer didn't see it. Since I can't get the right software to set it up, it is being returned.The seller needs to get serious about this business or quit wasting everyone's time.

I posted the photo of a water drop on the feather with a purple glitter background

I did not crop the image whatsoever, only adjusted the coloring some

I really enjoy these just be careful about fingerprints because they are a pain the booty to clean

Definitely worth trying out for how inexpensive they are.

$review_text.: What can I say other than it works as advertised, it is a quality built product and the manufacturer stands behind it.  This is my seventh LaCie drive in the last five years (all still functional) ... I was a big Maxtpr fan until their stuff turned to junk.The product is well packaged and when you open it, everything you need to hook up is in there - PS, cables, quick connect instructions.  Hook up to my Appleshare Extreme wireless router was a piece of cake ... plug and go.  The Mac version of the software installed quickly and glitch free.  Configuring the drive on the network was easy but I hit a connection issue on one of three computers hooked up to my network when used with Time Machine.  A quick call to LaCie got me in touch with a knowledgeable tech and she solved the problem within a few minutes (just a "button" I neglected to click).The device works perfectly with Time Machine and all three Macs, both wireless and wired to my network.  I backup off site anyway as I am a huge believer in data redundancy, but now I also have three computers backing up automatically, on the same drive in a secure area of my house (dry basement).  I personally think Amazon's price for the 2 gig model is very good.In my experience (not vast but not inconsiderable either), LaCie makes high quality gear and stands behind it as advertised.  I buy their drives with confidence and I shop Amazon with the same confidence.As a side note, if you don't backup your data, you are asking for severe problems in your life.  If you just backup to a drive hooked up to your computer, it's better than nothing but not ideal for data security.  If you backup to a NAS drive located in a somewhat secure area of your home (dry and fire-resistant), you are in good shape.  If you backup offsite (either on the net or to small HD's locked in a bank vault) and you back up to a NAS drive and you back up to a local drive on your computer, you are in data safety heaven.  I do this on all three of my computers, never lifting a finger and never even think about it.  I have hourly backups on time machine to two locations (local computer and NAS) and a daily backup offsite, all accomplished without human intervention.  Oh, by the way, the offsite stuff is encrypted.  I crashed a work/personal PC once and lost a good chunk of the data that makes up my life.  You can't put a price on that, especially when backing up correctly is so easy these days.Buy this drive, or one like it, and simplify your life.

$review_text.: When I first saw the ExoMount CD slot car mount, I was little bit worried that it might damage the CD slot in my car stereo.  After I got the product, I found out that the inserted part was less than a half inch long to the CD space and the ExoMount CD slot car mount has been working great since then.  The only gripe is that it was tight for my Galaxy Note 2. The maximum width it can expand was little wider than the Galaxy Note 2 and it was not very easy to access to the levers behind the mount to release the grip.  Other than this, the ExoMount CD slot car mount truly replaced my suction mount and I do not have anything blocking my view in the car now.  I wish that the price goes down (lost one star there), but the quality of the product is top-notch.  Great mount!

$REVIEW.: The mouse is quite decent considering the price paid. At first glance, it seems like it would be nice for long gaming session due to its shape and that the fingers can rest on the right side. Once you actually use it, you soon realize how uncomfortable it is to hold. The spot where the pinkie is supposed to rest is far to small, so you have no comfortable place to rest it. It just awkwardly moves around trying to find somewhere to go. Also, my hand started to cramp after an hour or so of continuous use. Its okay for casual use where you are not constantly holding the mouse, but gaming is a no go on this.

$review_text.: I purchased this wireless adapter on December 31 and received it on January 8th
One thing I like about Amazon shipping is that many times your order will come before the expect date (which was January 11th).On to the purchase


I saw this thing and decided to get one because I would rather connect my HD Samsung television and my Samsung BDP-1600 Blu-ray player wirelessly instead of having to run two extra Ethernet cords from my modem to each device
It works well and is good as advertised


All I had to do was to go into my network setup on my television and my blu-ray player, select connect wirelessly, enter the modem password, and presto, that's all to it
Now I can go to Pandora, Youtube, Netflix, and Blockbuster on my blu-ray player and can get weather, news, and stock quotes on my television via Infolink


So cool


Because I won't be using it on my blu-ray player as much, I'll probably just use this one instead of getting another one


But who knows: down the road I just might get another one

Samsung is starting to fill my room

:-)

$REVIEW.: I had doubtful opinions when I bought this with my new Nikon D40. I thought the 100 or so dollar flash would turn out to be a piece of junk. And with my extremely miniscule budget of only $650, I can't believe I got great camera with an even better flash! After all, after composition, the most important part of photography is lighting!I used to have aCanon PowerShot SD800 IS 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Image-Stabilized Optical Zoom. It's flash was quite unappealing. It was ugly and made photos look unflattering. But oh, no more.The best part of this flash is the ability to bounce it at a 90 degree angle. The result is very nice looking, soft images. And only for $100! To experiment, I went to a tall and very dark cave. I brought my D40 and this flash with me, bounced it, and got extremely well-lit pictures. Wow!This flash is small and I'm glad I did not buy a bigger one, it would be a waste of money (and space). I like that it takes only 2 AA batteries, which I can store easily in my pocket.So overall, this flash was a very good purchase. If you have the money I recommend it instead of, say, another lens.

$REVIEW.: It gets the job done

I've got no complaints


I've mounted it between the side panel and the fan with two different types of fans and I've had no issues with it
The addition of the small magnets in the corners is nice.EDIT: I've since stopped using this fan filter

It still does a great job, but it dramatically restricts air flow

I noticed a sizable increase in the amount of air moving through my side intake when I removed it

I'm leaving my star rating the same because it's a great filter if you're not overclocking, I just decided it wasn't worth the tradeoff for me.

$REVIEW.: A while ago, I wrote a review of this product entitled &quot;Very cool, but flimsy...&quot; in which I indicated that, even though the expandable  Palm keyboard had changed the way I worked with my Palm V, I'd had some  problems with it.  A few days ago, I was contacted by the president of the  manufacturer (not his administrative assistant), offering to replace my  keyboard.  I got the FedEx a day later with my replacement keyboard.  This  kind of concern for my satisfaction impresses me as much as the thinking  behind the keyboard itself.  As a result of this very positive experience,  I need to amend my original review from a lukewarm 3 to an enthusiastic 5.  The product's still a great one, but the company's focus on the customer  makes it even better.

$review_text.: I have two of these and use them in my cars which don't have native Bluetooth built in the vehicles electronics


 Both vehicles have aux input jacks on the front of the stereo so I just leave them plugged in and have attached them to the vehicle using a small piece of velcro so they aren't just dangling from the wire


 It would have been nice if the manufacturer that included some velcro with the unit since this seems like an obvious aesthetic fix that most people would want to make.My other wish is that they could sense the stereo being turned on through the input jack and therefor cause the adapter to turn on automatically

 Instead, you have to turn it on manually every time you want to use it


 Again, not a biggie, but would have been a nice touch/feature.

$REVIEW.: I mainly use this drive for a universal Windows 7 installation and it works without issue. I won't go into the breakdown of data speeds, since so many others have already detailed the technical performance, and will instead focus on the more practical aspects from a general consumer standpoint.The drive is small, but very sturdy due to its metal construction, making it safe for transport and portability. Unlike other USB drives, this one is the width of the USB port, so it may be too small for those with larger hands. Nonetheless, it doesn't pose any problem save one of preference. In addition to this, it's mall size may pose problems when removing it from the USB port. While I haven't had any issue on my computers, depending on the manufacturing, some USB ports may be tighter than others.The keyring hole is a nice addition and make it easy to transport several of these at a time. I don't carry a keyring with these on me like a normal set of house keys, but I do use a keyring to keep them altogether in my tech kit.Overall, this drive does exactly what I needed it to do and performs well as an installation resource for my Windows OS.

$REVIEW.: I have used a Garmin Vista in the past and was pleased with it. The larger color screen on the 60c is much easier to read. I used it on a two week trip hiking in Montana and only rarely could I not get a signal, and then only for short distances in thick woods. One set of alkaline batteries lasted for three and a half days of about 7-8 hours per day continuous usage. The claimed battery life of 30 hours seems to be about right.Great unit that can download/upload in either fast USB or serial mode. Its extra buttons compared to the Vista series makes it a bit easier to use.

$review_text.: The computer it is being used on is a slightly old HP Slimline running Vista OS.I was averaging .9mbps download, .97 upload speeds using the internal network card with 1-bar strength.(LOL, the upload is faster than the download!)Using it to connect to a Belkin wireless-G router located 40 feet of so away.First attempt:  I plugged the Alfa USB adapter into the HP computer and let Windows Update install the drivers.  Took a while because the PC is slow and that's how it likes to roll.  Everything appeared to install just fine.  I connected to the router, showed 5 bars!  However the connection speed was so slow that Speedtest(.)net couldn't even complete the test!  Something was definitely wrong.  Maybe I need to reboot the PC?  When I rebooted, the HP computer didn't want to boot up Windows.  Luckily Windows automatically created a Restore Point prior to installing the Alfa drivers from Windows Update.  Dodged a bullet there.Second attempt:  After restoring Windows back to it's running state, I decided to use the included Install CD.  In case you were wondering, I read some of the other reviews which stated that the CD was worthless.  That made me nervous but I was running out of options since the Alfa website was absolutely useless as well.  The drivers and a Utility program for the adapter installed without a hitch.Now it's working perfectly!  It's grabbing practically all the signals in my neighborhood.  Not that I want to connect to them since most are security protected.  The point is that I can now connect to my Belkin router and it's now getting around 14mbps download speeds compared to .9mbps before that.  Upload speeds are still the same.  That's pretty good since the average download speed on the wired connection is 16mbps.My situation may be unique.  Either that or I got lucky with the install CD.  Just wanted to share my experience and let others know that if they have Windows Vista on their PC, try using the install CD first.  Do NOT connect the USB adapter to the computer until AFTER the CD installation has completed.  When it has installed the drivers and program, connect the USB adapter to the PC and let it do it's final install thing.Final thoughts: The 7dbi Panel Antenna did work slightly better than the 5dbi stick antenna in my situation.  However the Panel Antenna is supposedly more directional by nature and I knew exactly where to point it so that may be biased.  The clip window mount also helps in locating the adapter to better location away from the PC using the included USB cable.Hope my review helps someone out there looking to improve their wireless performance.  Good luck!

$review_text.: Okay I have a Toshiba Excite 305 and the Asus.  I got the Asus for the screen and better battery life mostly.  My issues with it are as follows:1) speaker (as several have pointed out) is on the back and just doesn't sound that great. Couldn't they at least put two?2) it does hang on occasion,  not often, but my Toshiba never did.3) some light bleed,  less than Toshiba.  I can deal with it.4) no micro USB5) lastly it is not as comfortable to hold as the Toshiba.  It is light but the edges can be uncomfortable depending how you hold onto it.On the good side - screen,  wifi, battery,  etc... are all good.  I really like the tablet.I will probably be keeping it and sending my Toshiba back.  The only thing that really gets to me is the speaker on the back.**** updateOk after 3 days of use I decided to send my Toshiba back and keep the Asus.My only real issue that has been nagging me is that the edges of the tablet make it a little uncomfortable to hold in some positions.  The Toshiba was very comfortable in the hands.  I ordered a case which will probably take care of the issue.

$review_text.: This is a nice little travel backpack for the PEN series cameras. It is very small and does look a bit ridiculous if you wear it like a traditional backpack. However, if you just use the single strap (by zipping the 2 straps together) and use it on the shoulder - it looks just fine. Everything is a nice, snug fit - one star ding as the quality of materials could be a bit better - but overall - it is functional and is better than lugging around a huge camera pack or a flimsy little camera case. If possible, I would see the product in person before committing to purchasing it.

And the design of this speaker is so sleek and modern and it fits in with most decors. And everything in the ad for this speaker, turns out to be 100% correct.Again if you have seen the iPod speaker set up that BOSE sells for $300.00 plus dollars, and you knew that you could have this speaker that is on par with the BOSE and for much less money, under $100.00, why wouldn't you buy the Logitech speaker?

$review_text.: A little background ... when HD TVs became a big selling commercial product (4-5 years ago), it was a big "profit center" of businesses to give you a good deal on the TV, and charge ridiculous prices for HDMI cables.  "You need this" the big box salesman would say and then hand you a $30 or $40 package with a 3 or 6 foot HDMI cable - usually of dubious quality.  Many still do this, and some of the bigger high-discount box stores still have amazingly high prices on "accessories" for any audio or video equipment.Savvy consumers quickly learned that they could get a perfectly good HDMI cable for single digits, and an online cable business in the Los Angeles area has made a big business about selling excellent quality cables for small markups.Meanwhile, Amazon has also been a great source for third party companies selling good cables at steep discounts.  At the same time, Amazon has become involved in providing video content, so it makes sense for them to also provide their own products for watching those videos (assuming that your 7" Kindle Fire screen is too small, lol).Just looking at these cables shows that Amazon is quite serious about the video business.  The smooth black plastic with the Amazon name/logo is covered with cellophane to keep it looking good for when you are ready to install the cable.  The plugs are relatively slim, so that they fit in situations where there are plugs above and below the HDMI jack.The Amazon Basics name on the cable itself, shows that even the raw cable supplier is making significant quantities specifically made for this product.Unfotunately, I cannot yet test the ethernet or other advanced capabilities of the cable, but it is certainly nice to know that it won't be necessary to buy a new cable later if I do upgrade.The cable clearly has tough and solid construction, without being overly thick and awkward to work with.I did try replacing the HDMI cable to my main living room 1080p screen with this cable and could not detect any difference.  Since the 3 year old cable was a top premium HDMI cable of its day, that is a very good recommendation for this product.Of course, the biggest selling point is the very inexpensive selling price of this cable.  Since it qualifies for Amazon's usual free shipping when included with other items to make up the minimum, it's hard to find any other HDMI cable of equal quality at this price.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent value for an HDMI cable

$review_text.: I was a bit apprehensive about this product, as there seem to be a few buyers who were disappointed. Apparently, it just doesn't work with some home wiring. Happily, I'm in the majority of those for whom the device worked immediately and flawlessly. I plugged one "wall wart" into an electrical outlet next to my router, connected it to my router via an Ethernet cable, then plugged in another wart next to my computer, and connected it to my LAN port on my computer. To my considerable surprise, it worked immediately--I was up and running on the LAN, with an internet connection that was perceptibly faster than the G Wireless I had been using. I was surprised that there was no configuration necessary--I didn't even read the darn instructions! I immediately bought another one for my daughter's computer (on the same network), and dustbinned my wireless AP. After the nightmare of Windows wireless configuration and flakiness, this device is like a life raft to a drowning sailor.I should mention that the password configuration was a bit tricky--and reading the instructions didn't help. What threw me was that the password utility shows a nice list of the connectors it finds on the network--except the one that's attached to your own computer (the one you're running the utility on) it only showed me my router's and my daughter's (no SHE doesn't have warts...). You have to configure your own device "blind". This is something that could use improvement, hence only 4 stars.

$review_text.: ***UPDATE 5.9.13***After less than a week of using this keyboard, the "3" (below F2) stopped working


 No three or pound sign..

just great
 The next day the "2" next to it, (and of course the "at sign") stopped working.I contacted the seller, WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS, as on their packing slip it says "Please remember to contact us if there is a problem before leaving any feedback
 We want the opportunity to provide you with our excellent customer service and earn your positive feedback."  WELL LET ME ASSURE YOU..

THEIR SERVICE IS ANYTHING BUT GOOD and they pretty much told me to get bent, and to contact Saitek

 When I told them that they wouldn't be recieving a good rating from me, they had the nerve to warn me that they were contacting Amazon.com to report my "threatening" behavior!SAITEK's customer service is very much the same as WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS
 TERRIBLE and NONEXISTENT!!!  After days of waiting, I'm apologized to for the long wait, and informed that I have to pay to have the keyboard shipped back to them


 I'm also expected to follow 37 lines of instruction on how to do so

 This isn't counting greetings, names, addresses, spaces and the warranty small print, etc., which all take up SEVERAL more lines of this ridiculously long email

 I've been waiting for an answer to another question since Tuesday, but haven't heard back from anyone yet.I'm so disgusted with how we do business in this country these days, I could puke

 Shameful and disgusting!8/15/2013:  I'm still using this piece of crap, as there doesn't seem to be anything much better on the market


 It ticks me off every single day that these keys don't work, and what horrible service I got from the seller and Saitek

 Thank goodness for "ALT codes" that allow me to type "@" and "#", which are the two keys that NEVER work!***Finally, I've found a keyboard that I quite like!  This has the "old fashioned" style keys that rise up above the base of the keyboard


 Each key has a decent amount of space between the other, as well

 (Compared to the "modern" keyboards that have flat shapeless, almost non-existent keys with no spacing between each one).I feel the quality of this board is quite good
 It's heavy and sits firmly on my desk
 Even with the hand rest on, (which I thought I wouldn't use because it would be too big), it fits nicely without extra bulk and wasted space


 I like the dual leg system which gives three angle options


 They pretty much stay how you set them too, which most keyboard legs don't.I'm VERY happy that I bought this keyboard
 I used my Logitech K800 for over a year, and had I not needed the lighting that it provided, I would have sent it back
 (Another one of those flat, shapeless, non-existent key keyboards

 Yuk).I'd have given this one five stars if it.....~Was cordless
 Although this has a sturdy and long cord that doesn't seem to be bothering me in the least.~It had white lighting that was plenty bright


 Although the red, purple and blue lights are nice, but a bit dim.~The light color would stay set as I leave it
 Every time I reboot, it goes back to blue
 I use purple, as it appears to be the brightest.~The sound buttons could afford to be a bit bigger and spaced out, but I'm coping just fine.~If each key was just a little more "dished", I'd be ecstatic!If you like the old style keyboards, this is a winner


 By the way, I'm not a gamer by any stretch of the imagination
 For me, this is a good all-round workhorse!

$review_text.: I bought these headphones for two purposes: to listen to music at work and while jogging.WORK:I plug my headphones into a 2 foot extender which plugs into the headphone jack of the computer. I've noticed no loss of sound quality.The very first time I put these on and watched a demo video, I was shocked at the "surround sound feel", so much so, I looked around, thinking someone else was playing a video. The sound is VERY clear, you can hear all instrumentation in the background. On my old cheapy headphones, I had to have the volume at least 10-12 bars high to hear, with these, 3-4 bars will do perfectly. This shows the large range of volume these have.I was pleasantly surprised that the ear "piece" actually swivels in and out for a better fit to your head. It took a week to get used to the large, flat cushioned ear piece (it kind of smashed my ear), but I barely notice now.CON:I thought the wide head band would fit better on my head, but for some reason, even sitting still at a desk, these still slide backwards on the smallest setting. The surface is extremely smooth, no grip, which is probably the reason. It's the only annoyance I have with these.JOGGING/EXERCISING:I had some slippage as well while jogging, but again, will have to play with the adjustments. Note: The ear cushions are large and if you sweat a bit, this will make it a bit uncomfortable as they will get wet. (However, it's better then ear buds constantly falling out of your ears)All in all, these are PERFECT for the price of a basic user. I'm VERY happy with my purchase.

Make sure you go to compatibility mode until they update their firmware.  After I crossed that bridge, it was smooth sailing. Typical setup for a router. I do wish they would actually use the term "Port forwarding", however, instead of or in addition to "Gaming".The failover to my Clear 4G was spot on. I live on an small island in the San Juan Archielago where the Cable Internet service can be spotty, so got the $20/mo 200MB Clear 4G USB modem to cover those times my Cable fails.

$REVIEW.: I don't know why I waited two years before purchasing my own modem.  I would have saved 2 years' worth of modem rental fees with Comcast Cable.This is a great modem, and replaces an RCA modem I was renting that was always going offline.  I NEVER have to reset the Linksys modem (pulling the plug), and the performance seems a tad faster and more consistent.  If you have a Linksys router, their devices are all stackable, so you can save desk space.I rated it 4/5, only because of one bad feature: heat.  While Linksys devices are stackable, the devices get really HOT when stacked on top of each other.  I don't know if it would cause a meltdown or anything, but right now I'm trying to figure out how to create some buffer between the two.  When they're apart, each stays cool, so I'm pretty sure it's just a question of being too close without enough air circulation.

It works fine for all of that and I haven't had any problems with it in the 4 months or so I've had it.It's not quite as fast as some other (more expensive) thumb drives I've used - but if all you are using it for is mostly as convenient storage and as a secondary backup for important files you transfer between computers, it works just fine.To give a sense of the speed of the drive, I compared the time it took to upload and download a 1GB video file, to and from this thumb drive, to and from another thumb drive I have (aPNY Attache 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive), and to and from my desktop external hard drive that I use for backup (aSeagate 1TB USB 2.0 External Desktop Hard Drive).Here are the speeds I recorded, for downloads from my computer and uploads to my computer of my 1GB video file:The Cruzer - downloaded 2min, 40s; uploaded 45sThe PNY Attache - downloaded 1min, 27s; uploaded 56sThe Seagate - downloaded and uploaded in about 35sBottom Line: I know this isn't really a scientific test, but gives a rough rule of thumb for this thumb drive: it's a bit slower than some out there, but works fine and well enough for many purposes.  For day to day ordinary use, 4GB of storage at this price is a pretty good deal.  I'm quite happy with it.

$REVIEW.: We should have bought this when the tablet was new
 My daughter took over my hubby's KFHD and it already had a couple of scratches


 Just got the protector because I like this type of protectors for a tablet
 They are cleaner and clearer than the regular screen protector, and last longer in my opinion

 Fairly easy to put, important to just let it dry so it looks the way it should be because at the beginning the colors and screen look a bit weird.

$REVIEW.: The excellent, Good 2.4 and 5Ghz range

 This adapter stays very cool thanks to the USB bendable Extension and bigger plastic case design..

Signal strength is great for the 2.4 GHz/5ghz band, and on par with all other WLAN dongles
 Data transfer speeds are awesome with the 5GHz band, Im getting consistant +8MB/sec speeds, way faster than your typical 2.4 Ghz data transfer rates


 The Asus WLAN utility is a great tool for finding info about your network, but you dont need it...The Bad, Windows XP, Windows 7 functionality epic, but Windows 8 x64 is lame( as of 2/20/13)
Microsoft has not released completed drivers yet, so you actually loose the 5GHz band functionality completely, 2.4 GHZ 300Mbps connections remain unaffected and speedy..
If you have windows 8 and your 5.0GHz connections are not popping up, the solution is to go to Asus.com website and find the windows 7 x64 drivers


Install that and your 5GHz band is up and running

 Because the USB dongle itself is a little bulky, this dongle will kinda prevent you from plugging in a second device if you have two horizontal USB ports side by side on your laptop...

You can get around this by using the supplied USB extension though and life is good.Info to consider:When looking at a wireless network setup, your router is the best thing to consider..
Your Wireless devices can only go as fast as the router does..


Especially when you transfer files among your devices..

Any brand will give you nice speedy internet access and download speeds with decent range, but good routers are quick and responsive to moving files among your house's network, high speed transferring data at long range ..

Invest a little more in speed, bandwidth, and dual core processors routers if you are going to push it a little more

Asus wireless devices cost a touch more, but these are the devices that you can push for excellent results in performance

$review_text.: The Panasonic Lumix GF6 with the 14-42mm lens kit is an amazing camera to someone like myself who has been using small point and shoot cameras for years.  The Lumix GF6 marks my graduation to a "real camera".This camera looks great.  It is a solid piece of equipment and everything works.  The pictures it takes using the iA (AUTO) setting allowed me to start taking quality photographs without getting very far into setting up the onboard protocols.  Pictures taken this way are crisp, well colored and obviously better than any I have taken with my various pocket sized digital cameras.The zooming feature requires manipulating a ring on the lens. That is easy to do, but a bit strange to a veteran point and shoot user accustomed to a power zoom.After only a few days with the Lumix GF6 I have learned to take advantage of the extensive list of scene choices that provide two dozen built-in adjustments for various conditions.The three inch composition/viewing screen flashes helpful information regarding these settings.  They go from adjusting to nighttime conditions to fast shutter speeds for sports or fidgety kids.In the Creative Control mode the camera provides another list of effects and color adjustments for shooting dramatic pictures beyond the norm.There are almost endless choices for adjusting the look of photos taken with the camera and I have only started using them, but suffice to say--this camera has them all.The mode dial on top of the camera can be set to aperture or shutter priority.  The iA (auto) feature is activated by a lighted button also on top of the camera.  The video button is up there too.I am having a ball shooting panorama pictures with that setting on the mode dial at the top of the camera.  That feature is amazing.I was surprised to discover I can add a date stamp to pictures already shot.  There are lots of times I don't want a date splashed on the lower corner of my photographs, but sometimes that is nice to have.  The Lumix GF6 provides the ability to stamp a photo and save it as a copy so the original remains clear of a date mark.The screen is a touch type (capacitive) and it swings out and up to allow one to compose shots at greater angles.  The screen flips up to point forward just in case you want to take a picture of yourself.  I actually did that a couple of times.  Anyhow, I like the screen.There is a pop-up flash that requires pushing a little button on top of the camera.  If one forgets to pop the flash a reminder comes across the composition screen.One thing that drew me to the GF6 was the WiFi function.  I can wirelessly transfer photos from the camera to my iPad and that was a big plus in making the decision to buy this camera.  The WiFi function can be used with several individual apple iOS devices after each is setup with the camera. I suspect most cameras will have the WiFi capacity eventually, but for now there are only three or four out there.The GF6 stores pictures on SD cards.  The battery is a Lithium Ion type DMW-BLE9 and a replacement Wasabi battery is available for about $15.  The battery life is reasonably good considering all of the camera features it powers.The movie taking capacity of the camera is more advanced than most I have seen.  I have a modern dedicated video camera and it is less versatile than the Lumix GF6.  I must admit that I didn't buy the Lumix GF6 for its video capabilities and have only used it in test situations.  It seems to work surprisingly well.The following remarks are not complaints or flaws found with the Lumix GF6, but merely observations and things that I had to consider before buying the camera.First and foremost, the camera with the 14-42mm lens kit is certainly no pocket camera.  It is large compared to the standard point and shoot cameras.  I had to accept that fact in favor of improving my photographs with a camera that approaches professional status.The thing is big and a bit heavy to a person accustomed to those small pocket sized cameras.  I decided the GF6 could go with me on special occasions and to places close to home, but it won't travel in my pocket.Having said that, the camera has interchangeable lenses.  There is a smaller 'pancake' lens and a power zoom lens (Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42) available.  These are both a lot flatter than the 14-42mm lens kit that comes with the GF6.  I might buy one of those someday so I can carry my camera in a large pocket.Speaking of zooming--the 14-42mm lens kit on the GF6 doesn't do much compared to the 10x and 18x lenses on a pocket sized digital camera.  Again, there are Panasonic lenses available for the GF6 that can zoom to 175mm, but with one of those forget the pocket thing.The camera comes with a neck strap, but I didn't us it preferring to attach a wrist strap to my camera.  I didn't want to look like an old man in a tour group with a camera hanging around his neck.  I've been there and done that, but not lately.There is a way to transfer photos from the camera to a close by smartphone or tablet directly with a system they call NFC, but that only works with Android devices.  I knew NFC wouldn't work with my Apple iOS equipment, but the WiFi feature made up for that in my estimation.There is no view finder on the GF6, but I haven't used one of those since my SLR film camera days.  I guess some photographers can't live without a viewfinder.  I do very nicely without one.As you can tell from this review I am not a professional photographer and a lot of what I have said is not very technical.  I don't think Panasonic intended this to be a camera for photography experts.  The GF6 is a bridge camera designed for those of us that want to take the next step in photography. It is probably best suited for the advanced amateur.Can I recommend this Panasonic Lumix GF6--you bet I can.

$review_text.: I have been waiting a VERY long time for an affordable 120hz 2ms LED monitor and this is it!This monitor has basically everything I needed and over-exceeded my expectations.120hz at 1080p 23" is the perfect size for competitive FPS gaming.Viewing angles are great and the frame is very thin and looks amazing.I own 6 LCD/LED monitors but this is my favorite monitor of all time.Colors are more vibrant then my other monitors which costed a lot more.I'm not sure about the current price but I payed $289 OTD.My only cons would be the screen is glossy causing glares and 3d is downright bad due to the ghosting, but that is not why I bought this monitor.Be warned that you'll need the correct video card in order to use this monitor to its full potential 120hz or 3d.make sure your video card supports Dual-Link DVI (quick google images search will give you an idea)I bought this monitor for gaming and the smooth 120hz which is much easier on my eyes.Grab one of these if you can, you will not be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: I just needed a switch to connect all my A/V stuff together and get them off the wifi bandwidth - who knew that everything was eventually going to have ethernet?  Plugged in, things connected.  Easy Peasy.Lightweight - so it feels a bit on the cheap side - but the advantage there is no worries trying to hang it on the wall, out of the way.  This was the perfect switch for connecting my 2 gaming consoles, the smart TV, and the BluRay to the wired network, eliminating all the extra noise in the 2.4ghz band and improving wireless performance for all the other devices in the house that need it - tablets, phones, laptops, etc.Plugged into the Powerline AV adapter and plugged my ps3 in and I was connected quickly.  Online gaming response is MUCH improved over the on-again/off-again of wireless.Price can't be beat - and for those who really want to tinker with it, this switch uses the same chip as the managed hub - and with some serious technical know how, you can make this switch act like a much more expensive managed version.  Google it up - I didn't need to do it, so I can't tell you the specifics.  For my needs, this was perfect.Rock on.

$review_text.: I had my eye on this radio for a few days and purchased it when it came up as a Gold Box Special. I'm very glad I did.This little radio does a great job, especially for AM purposes, where my favorite newsradio stations are.  I had no trouble tuning in on my favorite stations (AM and FM) including one station that broadcasts from Tampa, FL that I'm able to pull in from the opposite coast. The TV does quite well, but my area only uses 3 or 4 channels within the 2 to 13 range, so I hardly use that band area.The only surprise (for me) came with the needed use of an antenna for the FM and TV stations. Normally, the wire for the ear buds works as the antenna, but if you use the on-board speaker (which works great) you'll need to use the included antenna wire which plugs into the ear bud jack. But that's not a big overall deal.The first day I used it I accidently dropped it on the brick floor with no ill effects. One battery popped out from the impact. It still works fine - just a few tiny nicks in the front.I'm glad I didn't buy a cheaper radio, which is what I had originally set out to do. I like this radio. It's easy to handle, it's already taken a beating, and it works really nice. I look forward to using it for years to come.UPDATE:  Five months later and I have fallen deeper in love with this darling little radio. It's been dropped and slobbered on countless times (on tile, brick, and concrete flooring) by a 1 year old toddler. It still looks and runs great. (The lock feature comes in VERY HANDY when dealing with a curious toddler. Super feature.) My husband has complimented me on choosing this radio...it's helped us through Hurricane Charley and helped beat off boredom the days without power afterwards. I do not regret buying this radio and would gladly buy it again and again and again if I had to.

$review_text.: These work well with games where you need the 3D sound experience, as they do that very well and sound quality for voice (for conversations on Skype and such) is very good
They are OK for music, but if you have a good soundcard for music, and listen other than very casually you will probably want a second set for that.One thing that I'd mention is that I have a large head and they're really comfortable for me, which many headsets of this type are not

It's hard to make a headset that works well for all head sizes, especially when it's got a microphone attached.Also, I like the velour/whatever material used on the ear pads: vinyl makes my ears sweat after a while.For $100, I rate these 5 stars


At $150, probably not.

$SUMMARY.: They work well, are a good value at $100, and good for large heads

$review_text.: I'm giving these 3-stars due to the fact, that after doing some isolation testing on my system, I believe these are the broken link.I recently got an new Home Theatre set up (TV, receiver). Everything (XBOX, PS3, DTV box) connect to the receiver, then one HDMI run from there to the TV.I was having intermittent issues w/ certain devices losing their signal. I had 2 of these HDMI cables, and 2 of my own. What I'm about to explain in regards to trouble shooting is not scientific, but it's what I did, and it's why I decided to buy a 5 pack of NEW HDMI cables.I had these beefy cables (they feel very well made), originally connecting my PS3 to my receiver, and my receiver to my TV. Initially I was losing signal from anything/everything to the TV (xconn from receiver to TV) and also when playing blurays (PS3 to receiver). So I swapped these cables to my DTV box and my XBOX (thereby ensuring that my TV had a different cable connecting it to the receiver and the PS3 did as well). After that, if I lost signal from the DTV Box (which was using this cable), I could swap input to the PS and it would work.Long story short, I've not experienced the issue since getting all new cables (knock on wood). Was my testing extensive? Nope. Is there a chance it was something else? Absolutely. That's why I gave 3 stars instead of 1; simply due to the fact that I am not 100% that it was these cables. But I am no longer using these. I will try them on my other set (now that I think about it and see what happens), for all I know it was a compatibility issue of some sort.

$review_text.: Sloppily designed product advertises itself as a stand for iPad, but it works poorly with iPads. Only one of the two possible landscape orientations is supported, because in the other the volume control keeps getting activated. And when the iPad is charging, only one of the portrait orientations is supported, because there is no space for the charger cord. Some apps, by the way, require specific orientations, making the stand unusable with these apps.Why the manufacturer would not just design something for the iPad, rather than trying to throw in a design that works also for Kindles (which do not need a stand as much, as they are lighter) and generic tablets (which few people use), I do not know.Moreover, I found the product unhelpful for use while reading in bed, the angle is all wrong when one is lying down. There is also no way to secure the iPad - indeed it fell over once when I was trying to angle it for a more comfortable reading view. The manufacturer misrepresents the capabilities when it claims this product can be used for reading in bed, unless one actually sits up in bed of course.I will say that if one is sitting up in bed, then this product works well with an app like iBook (which allows the iPad to be used in any orientation). It is useful in that context. And the pillow support is good. But I prefer to read in bed lying down, i.e. at an obtuser angle.

$REVIEW.: My husband loves master remotes.  He has bought several over the years, and frankly, prior ones have not lived up to claims.  So, I was not happy when he wanted to purchase this one.  He argued that a net price of $139 after the rebate was worth it, so he bought it from Amazon about three weeks ago.  I can't go into the technical aspects of this remote; that is for other reviews.  I am only interested in the bottom line.  It took my husband less than one hour to program the remote for use on two TVs, and he didn't need technical support.  He believes that it is one of the most impressive pieces of technology that he's ever seen.Our main TV has Direct TV, a local satellite system, receiver, surround system, VHS, and a DVD player.  I can literally turn the TV, and all related systems, on and off with one punch.  For the first time I can use the DVD player myself, with that one remote alone, because the large, very visible, screen touch system is very intuitive.  Yes, prior to this, there were angry calls from me to my husband because the other remotes, plural, were terribly confusing.  Updates to this remote's software are continuously available online.  We also appreciate the recharging base and the design.
$SUMMARY.: The last remote you will ever need

$REVIEW.: So I had some soeakers I sold on e bay and wanted to upgrade so I bought these and I am sooo glad I did I bought them in black and they look so cool when lit up the only issues I have with these is that even if you buy a black system the remote is still white and the other issue (which I can live with) is that there is a little black sensor in the center for the remote and if you are not standing directly in front of it the remote wont work some times I lay in bed and want to change a song without getting up but the only way for me to do that is to turn the speakers directly towards me and sit up when changing a song...another thing I should mention is that these DO NOT HAVE A BATTERY COMPARTMENT! You cannot run off batterys only through the plug in the wall but a cool featyre is that when your not using it, it charges your I pod...i like that anyways now to the sound. Well the sound is great I mean its not like bose quality but basically you get what you pay for but its not tinny or anything its clear and loud and the subwoffers really help overall I say a great buy!

$REVIEW.: When I recieved the RAVPower 5600mAh External Backup Battery Pack Power Bank and unboxed it I was really impressed by how professional the packaging and contents looked. The item comes with a thorough manaual to describe how to use this product and which items it is compatible with. The item also comes with various charging tips and a velvet bag to store everything. The weight of the device is also not bad, I would compare it to the weight of a typical cell phone or ipod, maybe a little lighter.This is a perfect product for anyone who travels or finds that they need to charge their portable devices alot, like a cell phone where the battery drains quickly. It is perfectly designed to fit in the palm of your hand, pocket or purse. A very all in one versitle device that can be used to charge a multitude of devices, such as devices that don't allow for spare batterys such as an Iphone or IPAD. The cost point of RAVPower 5600mAh Power Bank which currently goes for $23.99 to $29.99 is comparable to buying a 2nd battery for your cell phone. The builtin flashlight is also an added bonus.Here are the product features:* 5600 mAh at full capacity* Compact, light and portable* Weighs 4.36 ounces* It comes with its own AC wall charger and USB micro-B charging cable rated at 5.3 VDC/1 Amp* Built-in LED flashlight that can lasts up to 250 hoursIncluded accessories:* AC wall charger* 7 adapter connectors compatble with most phones* 2 USB cables 7  inch and 28  inch in length* Instruction manual* 1 year warranty* Velvet bag with draw string to carry the battery pack and charging tips* NOTE: Does NOT include a USB to IPOD/IPAD charging cable but will work with the one provided by AppleDevice Battery Capacity (mAh (Milliamp Hour)) refers to how much power a particular battery will hold)* iPhone 4 Battery (1420 mAh)* iPhone 4S Battery (1432 mAh)* iPad 2 Battery (6944 mAh)* iPad 3 Battery (11560 mAh)* Kindle Fire Battery (4400 mAh)* Kindle Keyboard Battery (1750 mAh)* PlayStation Portable 3000 Battery (1500 mAh)* BlackBerry Torch 2 9810 Battery (1270 mAh)* Nintendo 3DS Battery (1300mAh)This device is rated at 5600 mah. For instance if your device is an Iphone 4 (1400 mAh) the RAVPower 5600mAh Power Bank will be able to fully charge it roughly 4 times before the power bank is fully drained.NOTE: The RAVPower 5600mAh Power Bank is limited to 1 Amp output so devices that can take more than 1 Amp will take longer to charge (IPAD 2/3) but this allows for more compatability with other devices (cell phones). Charging the device via the included wall charger (1 Amp) will charge the device faster versus using your computer USB port (max of 500 mAH).Some people also complain about the row of blue LEDs when the item is on or charging. I myself did not find them ultra bright or distracting at all. It is actually a great feature in order to know that your device is charging and how much charge the device has left.I was provided a free sample by the distributor for testing and evaluation to write a fair and honest review.

$REVIEW.: I am so pleased with this product.  I used the software, unlike others who have reviewed this product.  It is located in the disk when you click on the disk image.  It is there with a read me file and other files.  The whole installation was zero hassle, and I'm pleased to see a green dot that indicates it is working.  I found that my 2-year-old iMac has a Thunderbolt port.  I went into preferences, and went to Time Machine (after plugging the drive in), and I searched for the Seagate Backup. I found it immediately, and was pleased to find that I could use both my other external backup drive with the Seagate backup drive.  My old WD backup drive was running out of space.  Now I have 2 backups, and 3 TB of space to do multiple layers of backups.  I haven't seen a message that I am running out of space.  Now I can backup my virtual machine which always prompted that message.  If I see that message again I will surely know it is not the Seagate.  I'm so pleased to have this product, and I feel a whole lot more secure having it.  My 2 other smaller Seagates will be used to store art and photography, as I surely do not want to fill up my hard drive too soon.  I'd write more, but it was really easy!

 I have other plugs where both the base (below the color) AND the banana unscrew, to allow for a more custom and, in my opinion, tighter fit

 However, I got used to these and managed to fit the wires in just as tight as my other ones

I've read and reread the instructions, and they seem simple enough, but I still can't find my way back to a saved position.  I often forget where I've parked my car, and I thought this would save me from the echolocation method of wandering through a parking lot, repeatedly pushing the remote and hoping for an answering beep.  Unfortunately, the BackTrack has never once led me back to my car.  Once, I was standing right next to the driver's side door, and the gizmo told me I needed to go back 500' the way I came.  I give it two stars for being such a wonderful idea - I just wish I could make it work like the instructions says it should.

$review_text.: It's bright enough, and not washed out.  If the price is right, this is a good monitor to buy.When in the dark and with a dark image on the screen, around the edge of the screen, the white backlight is very obvious.  I'm not a big complainer, so if I noticed it and didn't like it, I know it will annoy other people.  Once aware of the white edge, it's obvious to me in any light on any image.  I still use it, and nothing is ruined for me, so this should only be a deal-breaker for some.The speakers are good for basic computer sounds, lousy for anything else.I've had it a while and use it a lot plugged into a 15&#34; 2010 Macbook Pro and have never had any troubles--although just to be clear, this monitor is no match for the quality of the Macbook's screen, though it is close to the same brightness.Some monitors have really crappy bases that you constantly think you're going to break--the base of this monitor is excellent, just what you would expect.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this warranty in order to protect my Sony Bloggie 3D purchase. Within a year of purchase, my camera started misbehaving, and I contacted the warranty system. Unfortunately, they said I had to first try to use my factory warranty service, and my claim was denied. Then, a year later, my camera finally started becoming unusable and I filed another claim. This time, the process was pretty quick, they sent me a shipping label, and received my product at their service center to attempt repair. Within a few days I received notification that repairing my camera would not be possible and they were going to reimburse the purchase amount. They did so through an amazon gift card that was I able to redeem and use for the purchase of a brand new camera. I was so pleased with the service, that I bought a new warranty with the new camera.

$review_text.: These are some very impressive headphones

The sound is incredible &#8211; full, natural separation; clear tonality throughout the full range; clean bass that properly complements the sound without being muddy or overbearing


Truly some of the best sound I&#8217;ve ever heard out of a set of headphones, even ones that cost three and four times as much as these.The key word when describing the sound is natural


No, you won&#8217;t get booming bass that drowns everything out and rattles your eyeballs


What you will get is music that sounds as close to what the musician created as you can get short of a live performance.The headphones are very elegant looking


The ear cups are clad in a gray-toned metal with a brushed finish


It looks nicely understated and modern


The ear cups are cushy and comfortable


The &#8216;phones come with an extra set of ear pads, which is a nice touch


The cups totally surround your ear providing excellent sound isolation
You won&#8217;t hear any ambient noise with these on.The headband is well padded and comfortable

My only comfort quibble is that they grip my head pretty tightly

Not painful tight, but tighter than I normally prefer
But, since these are ear surround headphones, a tighter than normal grip does have some benefits.The headphones use a Y cable, with inputs on each ear cup
The set comes with 2 cords &#8211; one with a 3.5mm jack; one with a standard 1/4 inch jack.They come in a very nice hard case (that is also available separately)

The case is excellent &#8211; very high quality materials (including a zipper that works very well) combined with practicality

My favorite feature of the case is that it has a zippered pouch that holds an ample number of cables
The pouch has Velcro on it, so it can be removed entirely from the case


Plus, it can be positioned anywhere on the inside of the case

Someone was actually thinking when they designed the case, rather than have it be an afterthought.These are undoubtedly the best value in a high-end headphone I've ever come across

The sound is nothing short of spectacular &#8211; far beyond what you might think you&#8217;d get at this price point
Spending more will get you some nicer materials (such as real leather and wood accents), but you won&#8217;t get better sound unless you spend a WHOLE lot more


Huge recommendation![Sample provided for review]

$REVIEW.: There were few reviews when I first got this bag and the original manufacturer's product description isn't for the bag, which shows you how valuable user reviews are. Now there are plenty of thorough reviews of this bag, which seem pretty accurate to me, so there's not much more for me to add. So, I provided a photo of how this bag compares to another product I reviewed,DCB-56 SLR Camera Holster (BLUE). Sometimes it's hard to tell the sizes of these things, so I show you a camera, a single-size camera bag and this bag, which looks like it could hold up to 3 cameras, or more, depending on the size and type.Unlike the Case Logic bag, this bag is not easy to get your camera in and out of quickly. This bag is more for transporting. I think this would be a good bag for traveling. I'm not sure, but it may be small enough to qualify as the "extra" carry on you can take on a plane in addition to one piece of carry on luggage. If so, and you have a lot of camera equipment, this would be a big help, especially since they charge for checked bags now.Another thing about this bag is that I think it would be better marketed as protection from "the elements" than just water (this product is not submersible, by the way). The emphasis is on waterproof, but in reality it would be good protection from dust and maybe protect in cold and heat, as well. It might be a good place for long term storage.

$REVIEW.: I'm intrigued to see that Amazon is asking me to review this as a toy - that explains a few things! It's cheap, low, quality, and mostly fun. But I have to say it's incredibly confusing to use--the record/stop button feels identical to the power/mode button, so I get them confused constantly and have to remove it from my head to look at the small text printed on the buttons. (Both buttons have a similar texture, so they feel identical when you're wearing it.) It takes a couple of hours to charge and then the battery lasts for a couple of hours (and can't be switched out--the USB cable is the only way to charge it), so you have to keep it charged and then plan to put it away after a while (which makes more sense if it's considered a toy). Quality is roughly comparable to the kids' cameras you get for $20.

$REVIEW.: My mother can't clap hard enough to use a clapper after a stroke and has to get up at night to use a bedside commode . I bought a couple of these and took plastic ties and packing tape and put the remote on her walker . Now she wakes up finds it and turns on the room lamp . She doesnt have to stand at night when it starts to become dark to put the light on either with the walker next to her chair .I use one for a lamp inside my house so I dont have to leave it on to keep from coming into a dark house and have one in a outside workshop .  There are many uses like turning on a portable heater before getting up or light in the garage . I bought the outdoor model here but use them mostely inside myself . Its nice to be able to do either . You can only use one in a general area of 100 feet or so because  both items will turn on I imagine but I didnt look to see if they came with different frequencies .I like that the outdoor has a little extension on it to allow something that would normally block the other outlet to be adapted without blocking it . Very good range . Very good purchase ,,very satisfied . This can handle pretty high voltage and amps . I am going to try this on a old window air conditioner with no remote next unless I can find a tempature switch with a remote . God BlessPS I hate driving around shopping standing in lines wasting gas . This is great especially the items with free shipping plus a discount to brick and mortor stores like this item .

$review_text.: I purchased a Sony NEX-3NL and knew that it didn't have a battery charger iincluded.  I can't stand to charge the battery with the supplied cable (takes so long) so I needed an inexpensive charger since I wasn't positive the camera was going to be just the right one.  Sony's charger was too expensive and I found the reviews to be harsh on many of the other chargers available.  This one was inexpensive and seemed to have the least bad reviews.I'm very glad I did!  I have been pleased with it and have used it numerous times--I'm keeping the camera and don't see any need to upgrade to a different charger.  Here's some of the comments on chargers and how I think this model compares:Materials it is made of.  Yes, it is plastic..but I have an authentic Sony battery charger for another Sony camera and don't find it of any less quality.Plug into the wall:  the battery itself is quite heavy.  I didn't find it a problem to plug in and it to stay. However, if you do you might try using an adapter or extension cord.  The plug-in holes seem smaller on those cords/adapters and might make a tighter fit.Over-charge.  I was a bit apprehensive about this but forgot and left it on all night but woke up to a completely charged battery that had turned itself off as soon as it was charged.  I now have no reservations about leaving it pluged in if I forget.Speed:  Wow...the battery charges fast! no complaints on that score.Tight fit putting the battery in the charge: I didn't find this to be a problem.  You put in the top part of the battery first and the bottom just clicks into place.It is well worth trying, and the company seems to have good customer service.  I would think if you did have a problem they would make it right.

$review_text.: i bought this tv to be a primary monitor for my pc.  i have a great video card and can support multiple monitors.1st of all- this tv only connects successfully through VGA (SVGA).  forget the DVI to HDMI.  and forget 15 PIN to RGB.  the latter two only get you heartache.2nd of all- the colors cannot be adjusted using the tv menu if you're connecting this way (SVGA)- only brightness and contrast.what this means is you need to use your computer's video card to correct the color on the tv.  ADOBE GAMMA is a joke for this purpose so forget that too.i bought a spyderPRO COLORIMETER to correct this problem as it's a very expensive color correcting software/hardware. guess what..that didn't do much either as it can't get the tv's color temp.so what i'm left with is a secondary monitor that has ELECRTIC blues and reds.  and there has been nothing i can do about it.  not to mention all the converstations i've had w/samsung's tier 2 telephone support.the tv shows gorgeous color and contrast w/game inputs, dvd inputs and cable inputs- but PC inputs.it's a great tv- not monitor. that's why 3 stars.  i expect more from such a high end, contemporary tv.

Seeing as its lasted this long, I would buy another one if this one goes out, but it doesn't appear to be having any troubles yet... knock on wood.Easy to replace and it fit right in without a hitch.Well it finally died last week after lasting 1 year and 7 months of "normal" use. I'm trying another brand with a longer life rating now and I'll see how that one does.Here we go...I bought another lamp with a supposed 6000 hour life. It lasted 2 weeks and blew out. Amazon was great. They refunded the entire purchase including the extra paid for quick shipping. I used it to purchase this lamp again. At least I know what I'm getting with this one. A year and 7 months is a heck of a lot better than 2 weeks.

$REVIEW.: I got this for an older ipod touch to see how well it holds up

I've been using another Belkin case prior to this and it has lasted me a while so I definitely expect the same quality of workmanship on tihs case


First of all, this fit older ipod touch as I could get mine in no problem

The material is strong and seems to hold up well.There's no screen protector on it so if you're expecting that, this case is basically opened up so you can easily access the touch screen.One big issue I have with this and I see it as a design flaw as I didn't have that with the last case is that the way it snaps close, you would need to open this case in order to be able to charge it
On my other case, it opened up sideways so it allowed me to easily plug in the charger while the case is still closed
This also means that it's harder to use this on docking stations/speaker and I have to take out the ipod completely to put it on our ipod speakers.Overall, while it does seem to have good workmanship and fits the ipod touch very well, it gets annoying having to flip open the case whenever I need to change the music or charge my ipod.

$review_text.: I like the player but it has a few design problems


 When the unit powers off, if you have a DVD in the unit, the door will open to eject the disk
 If you have the player installed in a cabinet, the DVD tray door opens and hits your cabinet door


 It will continue to do this until the lazer head of the DVD player is damaged if you don't take the DVD out and then turn the DVD player off.

$REVIEW.: based on other reviews, I guess I was expecting something a bit more compact and smaller in size

This is my first tripod so maybe I just didn't know what to expect


I've used it a few times

It works fine for my Sony NEX5
its a bit or a pain to screw the camera on, but its seems fairly stable
it is light for its size
 I didn't want to spend too much, being that this was my first one and I wasn't sure how often I was going to use it
 still on the fence about upgrading at this time


But like I said earlier, it is strong, durable and sturdy


has treated me well on a few hikes.

$REVIEW.: It doesn't appear that anyone who designed this product attempted to install it, or watch a novice install it - as the design of the battery compartment cover simply does not fit the magic mouse. Getting it on basically required destruction of the button on the bottom of the mouse. Terrible design.Oh, and it didn't work. I charged the battery completely removed from the mouse, charged it while in the mouse, etc. The charging station had a solid green light indicating full charge. In no circumstance would the mouse turn on. I jiggled the battery thinking the contacts weren't touching fully, but to no avail.Bad enough to make me write my first review ever on Amazon.It gets two stars rather than 1 because it came in a pretty box.

$REVIEW.: This is easy to put on, it attaches securely and will fit any speedlight with no problem. The effect was just as advertised, shadows were greatly reduced, more so with the inner baffle- even from a distance (however the light does become harsher at a distance). the design seems sturdy, there are no bars or wires but it hold it's shape nicely. There is virtually no set up other than to simply connect the Velcro to the baffle if you wish to use it. I have rented the gary fong (expensive) diffusers in the past and this gave me the same results. This is not really for use as a soft box I think, although as long as you are close enough to your subject it does give that 'soft box' effect. This is well worth the few bucks, much better than I was expecting for the price.

$REVIEW.: This cd case is as big as one I bought once in Office Max. One of the panels holds the 16 capacity nylon cd wallet which is a great deal to have on hand the dvd's movies seen frequently.  The case I have from Office Max costs me over $30 and this one was on special which costs me $14.99.  I couldn't believe the price when I saw it announced here on Amazon.  The only thing is that the area of the zipper doesn't look strong enough as the old case I have.  On the other hand I like the inside of this case with the extra cd wallet (old one doesn't have this)  and the way pages turn.  I bought this one because the old case I have ,even though is stronger than this one, the zipper broke few weeks later that I bought it.  I hope I have better luck with this one.

$review_text.: I was a little skeptical about ordering this portfolio cover due to some negative comments by reviewers, but now that I have it I like it.  It makes the Thrive look like a planner rather than a neat toy.  I think that's important because it makes the Thrive much less of an inviting target for thieves if left in a car.  It is also convenient for carrying the Thrive and provides a stand for viewing the Thrive in landscape mode.  I don't find the weight to be an issue and wonder if the reviewer who did was reviewing the right case.  The only reason I didn't rate this case as 5-star is that I'm speculating that it may become damaged in time due to a weak spot where the leather is only a narrow strip that must zig-zag due to the placement of buttons and lights on the Thrive.  That weakness is due to the design of the Thrive, not any fault of the case maker.  The only thing I didn't like about the case was the packaging it came entwined with.  I almost needed a user's guide to tell me how to remove the packaging without damaging the case.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to other Thrive owners.

$REVIEW.: I have a lot of tote bags, a rolling computer bag, and a briefcase. I wanted a small, reasonably priced, snug fitting carrying bag for my new iPad 2 that would hold it with its Apple Smart Cover and its power supply and not much else. I also wanted a sleeve-type bag for everyday use at home to give the back of the iPad protection from scratches. I ordered this bag, the Speck Apple iPad PixelShield in red (also available in black) for $3 (marked down from $39-see my review), and the Amazon Basics netbook bag with handle for 7-10" devices. That bag was $11.20 when I bought it but today it is $15.12.I've decided to keep the Targus bag despite the fact that it costs twice as much as the Amazon bag. These are my reasons. The Amazon bag is a little too big for the iPad 2, even with the cover on. Now that may be great for those who have a larger permanent case on their iPad 2. But I felt it was a little bit lost in that case. It is well made, and the zippers are easy to use. There is an external pocket for the power supply and/or a few small things. The interior is orange.  The carrying handles do not store away.The Targus bag is a bit dressier looking. The quilted padded exterior is water resistant (which I believe the neoprene Amazon bag is as well). But it fits the iPad 2 with the Smart Cover on perfectly-neither too tight nor too loose. The carrying handles are optional and stow away into their own little pockets that snap shut. It is nicely padded. There is an exterior zipper pocket that will hold the power supply, a headset or headphones and perhaps a small tablet and pen or a pack of gum or lipstick.  I think I will be very happy with it but the Amazon Basics bag is a very nice bag as well. And compared to the price of other bags, they both are very reasonably priced.I will be returning the Amazon Basic Bag but it might be just what you are looking for. I hope this review helps you decide.

$REVIEW.: After four years our apple router finally died


When my wife bought her apple computer, the salesman at best buy told her she had to buy the airport router at over $160

Well, it worked fine for a year, but then every time she started up her computer an error message said she had to update
When she did she couldn't get into the web, and would have to go to the mac store for assistance


I have a PC and never had any problems with that router, very strange

The airport died, yeh!!!, and I bought the Belkin 300 router
At first I couldn't get it to work, so call the Belkin support tech

Over the phone the tech walked me through the setup steps
Within a few minutes it was up and running
Belkin has a great team to help us not so savvy folks


I tested the down and upload speeds
Much better than apple and for a forth the cost
Both my wife's apple, and my PC works with the router
Thanks Belkin for a great product and wonderful support.

$REVIEW.: I used the Hype Bluetooth keyboard with my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34;, and I was very pleased with its operation

The keyboard appears to be well made and durable

The size is approximately 11&#34;x4&#34; with a &#34; rise

(By comparison, the AmazonBasics Bluetooth keyboard is about an inch shorter.)I noted a couple of errors in the user's guide


The guide says that 2 AA batteries are required


It should read 2 AAA batteries

Also the guide says the keyboard pairs as device &#34;HYCA8080BTK.&#34; It actually paired as device &#34;BTKEYBOARD,&#34; and I had to type in a PIN code


Once it was paired with my Kindle Fire, I typed a few emails and typed a new document in OfficeSuite Professional

I noticed that while the keyboard was paired, the virtual on-screen keyboard of the Kindle Fire was disabled
The keys give a soft but positive tactile response, so there's no question that you've pressed a key

The &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; keys have raised bars that touch typists can use to position their index fingers, just as a regular keyboard has.I'm still trying the different keys to see how the Kindle Fire responds to them, but I have learned that the keys that have the speaker volume icons (F11 and F12) do in fact control the Kindle Fire's speaker volume
Also, F8 pauses the music, and F7 and F9 advance the music track or return to the previous track in a playlist.I have only one minor complaint, and it's not serious: The function key markings at the top of the keyboard are black, making them very easy to see
The other key markings are white, and they're not quite as easy to read

I'm not a touch typist, so I have to see the key before striking it.But I like the keyboard


I definitely prefer it over a tablet's small virtual keyboard for typing anything longer than a few sentences


It's big enough to be useful, but small enough and light enough (11 ounces) to be portable and carried with your tablet when you have typing to do.A product sample was provided for review purposes.

$REVIEW.: Television technology has advanced rapidly in the seven years since I purchased my first high-definition, flat-screen television. After paying the "early adopter premium" on aSony Grand WEGAin 2004, I'm happy to report it is still running strong and has never had a single problem. The sustained long term performance of that television led me to Sony and the Bravia KDL40EX523 when the time to update the primary television in our house...a 10-year old behemoth with rapidly degrading picture quality and a giant 25" CRT picture tube that screamed "20th century throwback".If you were an early HDTV and flat screen adopter: you'll be delighted at the drop in price and increase in performance in the current choices on the market.  For this television, easy basic operations are supplemented with a range of Internet-enabled functions that expand its overall entertainment value (or time-wasting opportunities, depending on your point of view).Set-up was relatively easy. Assembly consisted of a three-piece base/post/rear bracket that secured easily with five screws. This can be done by one person, but you'll be happier with a helper. When I applied power for the first time, the television went through a brief self-test, followed by a menu-driven set-up routine consisting of on-screen menu items that you select with the remote. Following this, it took about 20 minutes to index the available channels and programming data from my provider (while waiting for my cable company's DVR to arrive in the mail, I tested this TV with direct input from the coax).The television's integrated WiFi immediately recognized and connected to the router (it will also connect via ethernet, which I did not try).This television is outstanding in what matters most: picture quality and ease of operation. HD programming is as vivid as you would expect it to be, and SD programming is also crisp. Sound quality won't be confused with anything coming from high-end speakers, but is perfectly acceptable. The controls on the remote are intuitive and nicely labeled.Most of the default settings for sound and picture were perfectly acceptable, and should require minimal adjustments for all but the most obsessive tweakers. I'd avoid the "simulated 3D" option, which mostly adds a buzzy echo.Among the Internet-enabled features are single-button access to Netflix. Additional menus provide access to many popular other Internet services, including YouTube Pandora, Slacker Radio, Hulu, Amazon video, Facebook, Flicker, Skype, Twitter...and any other site you want to view via an integrated browser). If you have a smart phone, you can install Sony's media remote application. While its usefulness as a remote control is basic, its best feature allows use of your phone's keyboard while doing searches of online content: far easier than navigating through the OEM remote's point-select of an alphanumeric menu.Video/audio quality in the applications I use (Netflix, Pandora and Flicker) were fine. Obviously the network carrying these services will have a large influence on their quality and responsiveness.Flicker is accessed via a family of Yahoo-driven "widgets", some of which work better than others. The Weather widget and Flickr widgets both work very well. There are nearly 200 others available (and the majority seem to be apps for local TV news markets).This television also immediately recognized and was able to access local media available via DLNA media server (enabled in aBuffalo Technology NAS device.Finally, if you are using this television with other late model Sony components connected with HDMI cables: the components integrate well with each other. This unit receives inputs from a recently purchasedSony AV receiverand SonySony Blu-ray player. The receiver power and input functions are automatically synchronized with the television options for programming source and sound (TV or external speakers). Very nice.While nobody can tell how long a piece of electronics will last, it's always a good sign when they work well out of the box, and this television has done just that.Exercise its advanced network/Internet-enabled functions, will require some comfort with LAN configurations and media server set-up (if you are doing local streaming).The printed user guide included has minimal information on set-up and functions. Detailed information is in an interactive guide displayed on screen via a button on the remote.A final note on The Internet-enabled content, which  can be placed in three broad categories:(1) The obviously useful,in the wheelhouse of the most popular online destinations today Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Hulu and other major names).(2) Some is stuff you may have never heard of, probably placed in partnership with Sony to drive eyes to these destinations...and presumably increase their revenues; I probably won't look at many of these.(3) Some of it is a direct reflection of the Sony entertainment monolith: is there *any* other explanation for a dedicated "Dr. Oz" content channel? Who knows why they think we need this...We live in a world fueled by advertising. None of these detract from the television's performance, but you should manage your expectations on the total utility of the Internet-enabled content.

The camera fits in perfectly and the magnetic closure works very well.  It is easy to get my camera in and out of the case quickly.  FYI - there is no extra space in this camera case for spare battery/spare storage disc.  This item is perfect for holding the camera when you don't want to carry a bulky case with spare camera parts.  The material is decent and looks/feels similar to leather.

$REVIEW.: I have had this laptop for 4 days now and 100% love it. The size is insane.I have owned 2 laptops over the years...a 15" and 17" and what I hated was lugging it around. I would always have to take the AC adapter with me...now I can leave it at home.It's so lightweight...this thing weighs like 3 pounds.It comes with a simple zipper cover and I can actually fit my Logitech track ball mouse inside with the laptop. I no longer need to carry a laptop bag because I don't need the AC adapter.The battery lasts about 6 hours for me.I replaced the 1 gb ram with 2 gb and it makes a big difference.I highly recommend using a software application called Eboostr to further increase performance. You can run a search on google and the site will come up. It uses your flash drive as additional ram. I notice a huge difference with programs like Photoshop or SoundForge. Plus you can get tiny 2 or 4 gb flash drives that you can leave plugged in. Or even better get a SD card and use that instead. It will stay plugged in your laptop using the SD slot and you wont even notice it.The webcam is great and works perfectly with Google Chat.Honestly, I have no complaints. Yeah the keyboard is a little smaller but I hunt and peck anyways. Next thing I am getting is one of those tiny bluetooth dongles and a bluetooth trackball mouse to become wire free.Another great thing is the Bios updater application it comes with...so you can keep this thing up to date.It also has some great hotkeys...plus ones you can setup for your own applications.5 stars for sure!UPDATE: Monday, December 8thLaptop is running strong. I have had 0 crashes and 0 problems with anything so far.Bootup time is just under 1 minute. I ended up buying a tiny bluetooth usb adapter and bluetooth receiver for my audio amplifier and works great.Seriously, don't spend the extra money for a Acer. You get the same thing for a lower price with the Asus.

$REVIEW.: This is a great camera. If it is on sale, take advantage. I only had one issue with this camera. It was not a design flaw. The camera had some contamination that made itself into the lens from assembly. This is not a common problem. The camera still took incredible pictures. I returned this camera and ordered another. Those saying this camera does not take good pictures probably can not use it. I had initially  taken over 2000 pictures with it within a one week period. Constantly turning it off and on. The color and clarity of the photos was incredible . I bought a Nikon S9100 a few weeks earlier than this one and had to return it cause the quality of the pictures were not up to par. Even though the Nikon was an incredible piece of tech the photos just looked flat and not crisp. With a few shots of this LUMIX I was convinced it took incredible pictures. I am a person who is not a professional at photo taking but often am complimented on how my photos look like Post cards. I usually use an upper end Kodak that creates incredible crisp and vibrant pictures. Due to the incredible lens and tech it contains. This Lumix was able to give me the same feel and was allot smaller for when I am not able to lug around a big camera. Remember this is a point and shot camera. It is not a manual camera. It will take pictures people spend thousands on filters and camera gear to accomplish automatically!!  It is small and very powerful.  Unless you need Super Macro or Super Zoom, this camera will work fine. My macro pictures turned out nice. It caught a Bee hovering above flower and caught the wings that were visible without blur!!  It is fast!!  The ISO is also great. If you are thinking about a camera, a Lumix is a great camera. Buy an extra battery. The battery is long lasting but since this camera is so easy to use you might just want to have an extra. I used one while on vacation and was glad I had it. Read the Manual. Info in it will make using it allot easier even though it is simple to use anyway. The camera is a solid 5.

$REVIEW.: I have several external drive enclosures with USB 2.0, and this one which is USB 3.0. Everyone can dig up the specs on the raw bandwidth of USB 2.0 and 3.0, but here's what I tested using: Thinkpad W510, ATTO Disk Benchmark v2.46 (Bench32), and a 7200RPM 500GB drive in this NextStar3 enclosure.The two tests I did was basically plugging in this into USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 slots on my Thinkpad, and here's the result:USB 2.0 slot with NextStar3 enclosure:  WRITE: 22MB/sec  READ: 30.5MB/secUSB 3.0 slot with NextStar 3 enclosure: WRITE: 59MB/sec  READ: 88MB/secBig difference!The NextStar3 case is rigid too.

$REVIEW.: And then one day it wouldn't power on.  Replaced the battery with a new one and still no juice so now it is packed up and being sent to a Canon service center at our cost ($20).  It was great for our daughters who are using it for a high school photography course.  The picture quality seemed acceptable and it is a very small and light camera.  One of my daughter's photographs has been given an award and is being advanced to a regional contest -- I suppose if it is good enough for that, then it will be good enough for most casual users.  But beware that if you have a problem with it, you will have to pay for shipping to get it fixed, which I don't appreciate especially since it is still under warranty.

$REVIEW.: I decided to sell a bass practice amp I acquired in an instrument trade and needed a 4 ohm long-excursion 8" driver to spruce it up for whoever bought it. The Pyramid WX85 seemed to be a suitable driver with some reasonable reviews behind it.When the driver arrived, the white poly cone was cosmetically flawed...unusual for a Chinese product these days. I went ahead and installed it rather than hassle with a return because it's unlikely the new owner of the practice amp will ever notice or care. The resulting sound of the amp was much better with the Pyramid than with the original pleated paper-coned driver. The lowest bass notes suddenly had actual tone...an attribute I deem essential for effective practice. Mission accomplished.Bottom line: not bad for the price. Four stars.

$REVIEW.: Bluetooth keyboards are very useful when paired with tablets and the right one can enhance the mobile experience, especially for those that need to write a lot on their devices. Keyboard cases can often make a tablet seem like miniature laptops, but in my opinion, not having one is better than having one that's too small.PROS:- Case material looks and feels nice- Magnetic closure easy to use- Easy Bluetooth setupCONS:- Keys are way too small- Wacky key layout is unusable- Not super stable when open- Keyboard not removable from case- ExpensivePairing my Kindle HDX to the Belkin keyboard was simple and quick. I immediately went into Evernote and began testing it out. And almost as quickly, I realized that the keys were way too small. I had to squish my fingers together quite a bit in order to type accurately. The feedback on the keys themselves weren't too bad, actually, but typing on it for more than a few minutes at a time was uncomfortable.The biggest issue I had with the Belkin keyboard, however, was the crazy key layout. Just look at the pictures and you'll see what I'm talking about. For example, in order to type an apostrophe, you have to hit the function key (Fn) and &#34;O&#34; at the same time. Huh? I can see messing around with the colon, semicolon, parenthesis, brackets and slashes, but the apostrophe? No. The apostrophe requires its own key and being forced to use the Fn key is bad form. If you look at Logitech's keyboard for the iPad Mini, you can see that even though they shrunk the apostrophe/double quote key, it's still an independent key.I'm sure that if you use the Belkin keyboard long enough, you'll get used to it, but I don't know why you'd want to. It's uncomfortable and the key layout makes no sense. I don't blame Belkin for trying, but I don't think a keyboard case for a 7-inch tablet works. If you make the keyboard too big, it ruins the size benefit of a small tablet. To make it slim, like Belkin did, you have to make too many sacrifices. Personally, I'd rather stick to typing on the screen or picking up a larger Bluetooth keyboard that's not built into a case.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this TV and have been extremely happy. Utilizing the 120Hz features does make for weird transitions on commercials and shows (except for sports) but turned off the feature and eliminated the situation. The only negative feedback on this TV is there are no hooks on the back of the unit so we could hide the cables. What I had to do was utilize electrical tape to tape the cable connections to the back of the TV to make a more seamless look and avoid having to look at the cables while sitting and watching the TV. Fantastic TV, excellent picture, but come on VIZIO! Engineer a couple of hooks on the back of the TV so we can hide the cables without having to tape them.

$review_text.: Any Cell Phone would have the same limitation as all FRS/GMRS radios, if not for the Cell Towers they communicate with that average 100 feet tall.  GMRS repeaters, mounted on towers or buildings, provide a reliable 10+ mile radius, although only the MR355 version of this radio is repeater capable.  But your average range between two FRS radios shouldn't be expected to exceed 1/2 mile unless you're operating on unobstructed flat terrain which may gain you another mile at best.  Line of site also applies to WiFi, and is why there are 'hotspots'.  Same issues that affect cell phones and WiFi also affect FRS and all other two-way radios in the UHF radio spectrum.  Basically, you create your own 'hotspot' with a pair of walkie-talkies.  I admit the package descriptions are misleading by a long shot.  Stand on top of a skyscraper, and yes, you may get 20 miles with some FRS radios.  I have listened to construction workers in tall buildings and not been able to hear a crane operator on the ground.  Hence line of sight (5 miles or more) was achieved by elevation, and ground level obstructed the others on the construction site.To save your battery life, transmit on 1/2 watt (low power) whenever possible.  My commercial GMRS 5 watt radio only transmits an additional 1/10 of a mile versus my FRS radios.  Antenna height and receiver sensitivity make a bigger difference in useful range than transmitter power.  So, there is little point in getting a GMRS licence when the extra power allowed to use is not that helpful.  I hold an Amateur and GMRS licence, and there is an FCC proposal to do away with the GMRS requirement as there is no enforcement, and almost impossible to enforce being a sort range citizen's band.  Same requirement was dropped for CB long ago.Motorola (Giant International) made a big improvement with the MR350, and most notably in the sound quality.  It's the closest they've come to commercial grade, but I'll never expect that without spending much more on a single radio.  Understanding what your party is saying is as important as range.  The simplest term for describing these is as neighborhood, or site radios.  Unfortunately, some won't even reach across the neighborhood you might live in, but that is a limitation of all radios used in the city.  These are perfectly suited for business use as well.Next thing I noticed right off is these are slightly larger than any other FRS radio I've owned, but still very nice to hold.  They've added a flat bottom to these which now allows them to table stand.  The PTT button is better than ever, as well as battery life.  The built in flashlight is handy too.  Other than that, there isn't much more to mention versus other Motorola's, old or new.  I always carry mine in a nylon holster, which also acts as a wind screen for the microphone.  The included swivel clips will be ok for some users.  I would consider these adult size, and my 9 year old son and his friend prefer the pager sizedTalkabout 2-way radios.  Keep in mind, the Midland radios will be even larger.  I'd recommend these to anyone, and would first make sure they understand what they're intended uses are, and are not.Personally I use FRS to keep in touch with my son as he visits friends in the neighborhood, which also keeps me in touch with the parents.  If it's far enough away that the radio won't reach, he doesn't go alone.  These are the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to keep in touch nearby.  More reliable than texting with his iPod on WiFi.  Knowing the range limitations will keep you from being disappointed with this or any FRS radio.

$REVIEW.: As others have noted, if you have FiOS, you have a MOCA connection on your coax network and this device taps into that to give you Ethernet right over your existing coax lines. The end result is that if you have FiOS, you only need one of these devices for each end point you are trying to add. If you do not already have MOCA on your network, then you will need the Actiontec kit (with two units) to start a MOCA network. Until I found this device, I was struggling to find a decent way to get an Ethernet cable over to my home office which is in an older house, and this turned out to be the perfect solution. While the speeds will not exceed 100Mbps due to the 10/100Mbps interface on the Actiontec device, this speed should be sufficient for most people. High definition video will stream nicely at that speed. I am very pleased with the ease of installation. I hope the device continues to perform well!

I figure the longer you wait, the better technology that you'll get for a lower price.I unsuspectedly walked into a store and was looking at a few sets.  After talking to the salesmen a bit.  I compared this set to a few others including a Sony.The picture quality is stunning.  The black levels are drastically improved over the models I've viewed just a year or two ago.  High speed motion doesn't seem to show artifacts.  The initial release of this set in January, was pretty expensive, but the prices for this set has dropped.

$review_text.: Nice to get AC power when you need it instead of switching out batteries when you're set up at an event. Kudos to Sony to make this item work for the NEX-system cameras as well as for the Alpha system cameras.One inserts the "battery w/connector" where you normally insert your battery. A small wire which leads to the larger transformer and ac cord, juts out of the battery compartment which is secured by the sliding tab. Cables are heavy duty which one prefers around the studio.The only negative was that I could not switch off "Power Save" on the Nex-5n. The maximum time I could choose was 30 minutes before the camera went into sleep mode.

$review_text.: The stylus pens are just as described. They are very solid/sturdy and have a premium feel. The colors are really vibrant and the extra tips are convenient.I use these on my GS3 and iPhone 5S. The screen is very responsive to the pens without having to press hard. On the flip-side, they aren't too responsive to the pens - so they are just right.The included strings are handy. I'm always losing pens, so to be able to attach them to the strings is great.Overall this was a great deal and I have no complaints. I'm very satisfied with the purchase. I even recommended this bundle to a couple of interested friends/family members.
$SUMMARY.: Very Good Pens

$REVIEW.: This product has to be the worst fitting, problematic device on the market.  It is uncomfortable and does not fit in your ear properly no matter how much you adjust it.  You also cannot turn the volume up too high or you'll hear screeching feedback.I wish I never had purchased it.  It is worse than nothing.  The price is staggaring as well...I only purchased because it was the only device that I found that was compatible with the crappy corporate phones we use.  Thank God I didn't pay for it personally (charged to the company).

$review_text.: After reading many reviews on this lens I decided to get one to see what all the hype was about.  I was fortunate enough to find one earlier this week and received it yesterday.  All I can say is that Nikon struck a perfect balance of performance and price with this lens.  It produces beautiful images which are tack sharp and have amazing color.  One of the great benefits to having a large aperture is lightning fast autofocus in just about any light level.  At $199.00 this lens is an extremely good value by itself.  As if that were not enough Nikon throws in the case and hood for the lens.  This is something previously only done on much much more expensive lenses if at all.  If you are even thinking about getting this lens, do not hesitate.  Shooting with it is addictive and the proof will be the smile on your face every time you look at the images it produces.  In conclusion all I can say is that me and my Nikon D40 could not be happier with this lens.

 Roxio on my ACER Aspire worked right out of the box with no further software installation needed.Fortunately, this unit comes with NERO software, which I had to load onto my Dell to make the unit work, and then it did just fine.Note...this unit works with both "+" and "-" DVD-R blanks


 Since many competing models do not, read the fine print on competing models if you choose to buy one of those instead of this one.

$REVIEW.: First off, these earphones are great! I've owned about 3 or 4 pairs of them. They are comfortable, stylish, versatile, and usually last me about 8-10 months. I take them with me everywhere because I never know when I will need some headphones. The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is because of one annoying aspect. When I use them while walking outside, the cord tends to stiffen, as if it freezes, when it is exposed to any temperature below 20 degrees. This can be somewhat annoying because the cord will bulge out in front of me or to the side and stay in that position until I get inside. Of course, I usually just tighten the cord a little bit while holding on to it in my pocket and that works most of the time. Again, great earphones!

$review_text.: I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that "DR" in an address means "Drive" and not "Doctor".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.  No more Garmin for us, ever.

$REVIEW.: I am not a professional ... just a mom shooting everyday pics of my kids. I like to get snapshots at family & special events. I have no interest in post processing photos except to maybe use the auto adjust in Windows Photo Gallery or on the print kiosk at Walmart or Walgreen's or wherever I'm printing. And there are times when I do want to crop a good amount. I have been using the camera on my smartphones for the past 2 years, and yes I recognize they are much better than they used to be. I have printed many photos from my smartphones, but they're still missing Xenon flash & optical zoom. The majority are also missing optical image stabilization.For a point and shoot, I don't think this camera can be beat. I am disappointed in the amount of noise or grain in the images. This seems to be a problem with newer point & shoot cameras. I think it's possibly the high megapixels they are putting in the small sensors (16 mp on 1/2&#34; on the F900EXR - slightly larger than the typical 1/2.3&#34;). I have tried out several point & shoots over the past year & all have had this similar issue. If you are not going to crop or enlarge possibly past 8x10, this shouldn't be a problem. I have looked back at my cheap point and shoot cameras from several years ago that were 3 megapixels, and they just did not have this amount of noise. Because of this, I finally decided to go with a dslr, my first (Canon eos Rebel T3 - an entry-level, all I could afford in my budget, and that is really pushing it), and there's just no comparison in image quality. I wish I could have a dslr with all the functions of this camera. I want to be able to fully zoom into my pictures and see detail and no noise. You just can't do that with a point and shoot, at least not the ones I have tried out. A dslr is needed for that.Autofocus on the F900EXR is as fast as it says it is. EXR Auto works perfect. Always chooses the correct scene. Pictures are clear even when fully zoomed at 20x. Lightweight & easy to put in a purse. I don't think it will fit in a pocket. Nights shots are great. I never need to choose Pro Low Light or High ISO/Low Noise, b/c EXR Auto does the best. Action shots are great. I find I get the best shot when using burst/continuous setting. I have captured kids throwing a football & running with zero blur.The camera feels nice and looks good.Video is poor. If you set the zoom before starting the video, it will be ok. But if you need to zoom in & out, it takes a while for it to refocus. I would not shoot even home videos with this camera. This will not work in a setting where you might be filming a child in a play. You will not be able to move the camera to follow them or zoom in.The reason for 4 stars ... I have had 3 of these cameras in my hand ordered from Amazon. All have had a small scratch/scuff on the lens. I have gently cleaned the lens with a dry microfiber lens cloth to see if it was smudge, and it was definitely a scratch/scuff. I have viewed pictures on a laptop screen & printed 4x6's, and it does not seem to show up in images. But I'm wondering how this is happening.Comparing this to a Fuji S8200, b/c my 8 year old son bought & loves that camera. I used it to take snapshots at a family Christmas to test it. F900EXR images have slightly more noise. S8200 has 40x zoom compared to 20X on the F900EXR. Both can take clear shots fully zoomed with a steady hand. F900EXR has just slightly faster autofocus. And only slightly. The S8200 is slightly smaller than a dslr, and it's a little heavy. Video on the S8200 is great. The autofocus works great.As I stated earlier, I eventually went with a dslr b/c image quality is my top priority right now. If I was going to choose a point and shoot, it would be the F900EXR.

$REVIEW.: I draw on my iPad using Art Studio, Pro-create, and Zen Brush (when I'm just messing around) and I love the feel of the Bamboo Stylus. It's a great weight for drawing and/or painting on the iPad, and it works well for detailing if you unscrew the silver tip and just use the rubber tip by itself. It's a little expensive for a stylus, but it's well-made and all the parts screw together tightly for a very solid feel. I wish it was a bit longer so it feels like I'm holding a real pen and not something that's just slightly longer than a golf pencil, but otherwise, this is the best stylus I've tried so far.

$REVIEW.: Been using it for a few months now. Im just a casual user. Last camera was a Nikon Coolpix 7.1MPThe good: the price for all that you are getting with the camera. You get 18x Zoom that is really quite spectacular. You also get HD video recording. Actual pictures are great once you get the settings down. I fell in love with the Macro and Super Macro. Detail is awesome! Nice vibrant colors as well. Battery life seems pretty good. I use rechargeable batteries and seems to last quite awhile. No complaints here. Size, weight, and overall build quality feels great. Large LCD screen is very nice.The bad: There is lots of noise when recording HD video. You can hear the lens focusing which sounds like a grinding noise. The most annoying thing about the camera is the freeze ups. I have a 4gb Fujifilm SDHC card, and it freezes up on me occasionally when previewing pictures on the card. You have to open up battery compartment to turn it off. It doesnt freeze enough to warrant getting rid of the camera, but it shouldnt happen as frequent as it does. It also froze on me once, just recently, when trying to save an HD video I just recorded to the card. Also, sticking the SD card slot in the battery compartment was a bad design. Camera has to be completely shut down to swap cards.Overall: I got the camera for the 18x Zoom and great picture quality, and thats what it does best. I like having HD video recorder for quick clips. Im happy with the purchase. The negatives of this camera just dont justify spending twice as much on similar cameras by Nikon and Canon if you are a casual user like I am.

$REVIEW.: TV looks good and we're happy with the picture.  It doesn't seem that the item is manufactured any longer but perhaps you're considering a used item.  It's an off-brand, and I wouldn't expect long term support, but for the right price (&lt; $400?) this TV is a good value.Yes this TV has lots of input and output compared to the current crop of models (perhaps it's an older model from another manufacturer that's been repackaged?).  One thing lacking though is that the HDMI ports can't wake up the TV from standby (e.g. which devices like Chromecast can take advantage of so you don't need the TV remote to start watching).As many have reported, the remote needs to be aimed directly at the receiver, like within a few degrees. To fix this, simply pop the plastic over off the top of the remote.  Now I can point the remote in any direction and it works 100%.  My conclusion is that the cover wasn't manufactured correctly and is filtering the infrared signal.The panel power button on my unit doesn't seem to work, so we can only power on/off from the remote.
$SUMMARY.: decent TV (and here's how to fix the remote)

I was able to plug this baby in, slap her hard-drive into it and BAM it just worked. It's quite a bit slower than I was hoping but that's likely because she is using usb 2.0 instead of 3.0.

$review_text.: Before I begin I must be clear in mentioning that I'm comparing these headphones to my cheaper Klipsch Image One headphones. The Klipsch retail for about $50 cheaper than the Sennheiser HD25-1 II, but I got them on Amazon for $70 during a sale. Unlike some of the low rated reviewers, I did get the same headphones as shown in the pics with the double band. I was a little disappointed with the quality build once again in comparison with the cheaper Klipsch. One reviewer mentioned that the ESPN analysts use these headphones which I confirmed after watching a few sports games so I was excited to get these. So lets get to the details.Sound = Wow, the delivery was very light. I listen to these headphones with no assisted power and with three different FiiO headphone amplifiers (E6, E7, & E11). Those of you who are familiar with FiiO know that the E7 has two outputs that allow you to listen to two headphones at the same time. I also used the L3 & L9 LOD connectors for my iPod. There is no comparison. The Klipsch has a fuller mid-range, richer bass, and slightly better highs. The Klipsch is also overall louder. For $200 headphones, I was expecting the Sennheiser to blow the Klipsch away but it was the other way around. I know Sennheiser enthusiasts with disagree, but don't comment until you compare both yourself. Trust me when I say that Klipsch is a better product. Is there a better Sennheiser model to compete with the Klipsch Image One? Probably, but at what cost. Once again Sennheiser HD25-1 II sales for $200 and the Klipsch Image One is averaging about $100.Quality = Its not the fact that the material is plastic, but its cheap plastic. Cheap looking and cheap feel to it. I actually thought I got a ripoff or bootleg model when I opened the box. I did however like the fact that the headphones came with interchangeable soft felt ear covers. I also prefer the durable cable quality of the Sennheiser over the Klipsch.Price = Well, you know where I'm going with this. A lot of people agree that Beats By Dre are overpriced. Really? Compared to the HD25-1 II the Beats By Dre are a steal. I can't justify buying these headphones based on my personal experience in both the sound and quality.Overall = Some reviews say that these headphones need a break-in period. There was no break-in requirement for the Klipsch. There is a positive to the Sennheiser HD25-1 II. It took a $200 hit to appreciate just how good the Klipsch Image One headphones are. The true deciding factor for me is when I used my FiiO E7 to listen to both pairs of headphones at the same time. The performance of the HD-1 II left me in denial. Once again Klipsch has made a believer out of me.

 Run-time is impressive
 Get these at [...] for the best price


 Had an issue at first using these in the PD30 R4, but seems to have cleared up (temporary power outages)
 I'd recommend these.

$review_text.: The picture on this television is as amazing as advertised, and it's by far the clearest picture that I've ever seen -- even nearly three years after I bought it. The blacks are deep, the colors are true and vibrant, and the images are crisp and nearly 3D-esque. Guests rave about the picture quality all the time, even when they have newer, later-model televisions. Likewise, Comcast and DirecTV technicians have ooh'd and ahh'd about this television over the years, even though they see various TVs all the time.That said, unfortunately, as have many other people, I recently started experiencing the "clicking" problem, and the television just stopped working. It will cost me $400 to replace the part that failed, including labor.Nevertheless, I would still recommend this television. In fact, if I were buying this television new today, rather than avoid this television as others have recommended, I would try to use this defect to my advantage, and try to negotiate a substantial discount or an extended warranty in order to cover the future repair cost if and when the television fails. Hopefully someone will be able to use this information as an opportunity to get an amazing television at a reduced price.

$review_text.: This ought to be one of the worst made products I have ever bought

Everything is bad about it from sound to its craftsmanship


The only thing thats ok is that the cord is a cloth like so it does not tangle

But You will throw these in the trash once you hear its performance
I bought 3 of these brands thinking based on the reviews they might be worth it

I was DEAD wrong! The ones I bought were Scosche Increased Dynamic Range Noise Isolation Earphones with tapLINE II Remote and Mic (Sounds worst than a Radio Shack transistor); IDR355MD & IDR655MD.1) The 655 buttons did not work upon receiving it


I didnt care cause I thought it was my iphone compatibility


It isn't.2) 655 broke after two weeks and I didn't even use it everyday

Unlucky for me I was on our vacation when it stopped working
So by the time I got back I'm sure it was too late to return it.3) The 355 sounded so aweful it reminded me of how a transistor from Radio Shack in the 80' sounded.Its craftsmanship are no match from companies like Denon, Sony, Creative, Sennheiser

If you buy any of these brands least expensive bottom of the barrel low end models --- it will still be better than any of the SCOSCHE top end models! Try it for yourself and I guarantee you will go back to our beloved AMAZON and process a return :)

$review_text.: Just got this in the mail today.In the first place the price for this is so low I don't know how you could have any serious complaints

I read in a couple of reviews that the power supply was underpowered

IMO this is not the case

The included power supply is 1000ma or 1 full amp
That's surely enough to power half a dozen or so USB devices
My only complaint is that the USB printer cable that connects this to your PC is very short (1/2 meter)
If this is a problem a longer USB printer cable can be substituted.

I have used regular Memorex DVD blanks before with reasonably good results, so figured it wouldn't be risky to save money on the big hive when it came time to step up to DL. BIG MISTAKE. This product should never have gotten out the door. I couldn't care less if someone else is having decent results, be warned - you could buy an entire stack of coasters. I have a solid Sony Multi burner, and it makes quick work of everything except these DL discs. Write sector failures always occur in different spots. I have gotten a few discs that would load after burning, but invariable freeze due to the garbage that was encoded. Bye-bye Memorex, not another dime from me.

$REVIEW.: WD is known for making excellent quality hard disk drives. I have owned several WD internal desktop and external drives in the past and never had any drives fail till date. This Passport Slim portable 1TB capacity with metal top is very well made and will provide years of service. I do like the new dual tone metal design. The drive is small enough to fit in your shirt pocket and has large 1TB capacity.The SuperSpeed USB 3.0 interface makes the drive work even faster on PCs and Laptops that have USB 3.0 interface and is fully backward compatible with older USB 2.0 interfaces. I ran some benchmark tests using HDTUNE application and here are the results:(*)Using USB 2.0 Read Speeds: Min: 29.2 MB/s, Max: 31.2 MB/s(*)Using USB 2.0 Write Speeds: Min: 14.5 MB/s, Max: 22.6 MB/s(*)Using USB 3.0 Read Speeds: Min: 96.6 MB/s, Max: 106.3 MB/s(*)Using USB 3.0 Write Speeds: Min: 54.6 MB/s, Max: 79.2 MB/sThe spindle rotational speed reported by HDTUNE application is 5400RPM. The drive runs cool even after extended period of time as the metal surface helps dissipate heat evenly. This is an 'USB BUS' powered drive. You do not need any external power adapter to run the drive and this makes it very portable.PROS[+] Very attractive dual tone design, Slim portable and comes with a carrying pouch.[+] Does not need external power source. Runs with USB bus power.[+] Speedy especially when used with SuperSpeed USB 3.0 interface.[+] 3 years warrantyCONS[-] It does not have rubber feet on the bottom and could scratch the bottom surface eventually.[-] This drive uses WD proprietary hardware interface. Data recovery could be challenging if the interface were to fail especially if you enable hardware encryption.When it comes to software included in the drive, you get 'WD Drive' Utilities, 'WD Security' and 'WD SmartWare Pro' backup software. These apps allow you to choose when and where you backup your data, The apps also allows you to password protect and encrypt the files on the drive or run disk drive diagnostics etc; You can also use your 'Dropbox' account to back up your files to the 'cloud' as an offsite backup.Overall this drive performs well. It is priced right for 1TB capacity. Four Star Product! Recommended.

$review_text.: A little exaggerated in terms of speed.I wish that Manufacturers would stay on the ground when they make a statement that only applies to the interface of the Drive,knowing that it will never get there!Fact is that the drive is somewhat faster it runs an avg. of 168Mbs as supposed to 110Mbs with my other SATA 3 drives.The burst rate peaks at around 300Mbs which is mainly to contribute to the solid state part of the drive.If the drive knows what to read ahead then it will perform well, otherwise it is just like any other mechanical only drive.For all Solid State Drives the 6Gbs maybe true, but not for this drive.This is why I gave only for stars, since it does not live up to marketing phrases.

$REVIEW.: When I originally was looking to buy a new computer about 2 years ago, I wanted something small and lightweight.  I was not sure what I would buy.  I happened to be at Whole Foods and saw someone using a small computer.  I liked the size of it and asked the brand, so I can look it up.  He said it was an ASUS.  I checked it out on amazon.com and found it for a great price and weighed only 2 pounds.  At the time there was also an offer where I did not have to pay for it at all for 6 months.I am still very happy with it after 2 years, but the one problem I have had from the beginning was the battery - it does not stay powered up once it is charged and I did have the company send me a replacement while it was still on the warranty, but the problem still persists.It does not have a cd/dvd rom, so you would need to get an external one, if that matters to you or not get a netbook computer.I will probably use this computer for many more years before getting another one.It is sturdy and portable and know it will last a long time.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted a TPU case that would cover all sides and corners of my iPad
The case seems well-made and fits my iPad well


It adds very little bulk


My screen protector has not been affected, as well

My only issue is that areas of the back are quite slick
Because the iPad 3rd Gen is quite heavy, it sometimes feels like it's going to slip out of my hand

A bit of texture throughout the back would have been wonderful.But if you're looking for a solid TPU case and are not concerned about the grip, this is a great buy.

$REVIEW.: This review has been written on 08-12-2010. Recorded about 4 hours of movies and 50 or so pictures on the Hdc Hs700k. The movie quality when recorded at 1080 x 1920 at 60 frames/s just blows you away it is better then what you will get from a blueray dvd. Still picture quality is not as good as my canon 7D but still better then most consumer cameras.  This camera is way ahead of its time. I use a top of the line HD TV and i suspect the camera actually supplies more then the tv can even handle. The only downside short batt. life. Get 2 extra batt. The other downside : As of this date there are no real choices of editing software. You have to use the software that comes with the camera. That works but is somewhat limited in editing variables. All the other newest type software out there starts getting the hickups when transcoding the m2ts files at 1080 x1920 60 f/s. I know its the software because my computer is an i7 quad-core with 8 gigs of ram.But its only a matter of time before the software makers catch up and give us more choices. So go ahead and by it. If you been waiting all your life for supersharp homemade video,like me, you going to love this one.BTW it has a slot for an SD card. If the hard drive fails (dropping it on a concrete floor while its running may do just that) you can still record up to 4 hours of movies on one 64 GB card. They are still expensive as of today but by the time the hard drive goes the will be dirt cheap. Holger

NOW it's $6 bucks, buy it!!  I have all the ipods except for the newest itouch, I have the old nano, with some songs connected to the car, this nano that i have music and videos, my wife has the last nano with camera and video
That was the best, btw

the new nano 2010 is smaller, but not really better than this original nano or the nano with the camera
 The ipod madness never ends!  Great case for this though!

$review_text.: The Speck Products "case" is not a case in the traditional sense, but a shell that encases and protects your MacBook Pro. It snaps on in a form fitting way, enhances the appearance of the computer, and offers a greater degree of protection.  The "see through" satin design lets you see the Apple logo when it's illuminated. The word "Spec *" is on the inside of the top cover, and unlike other some other colors of this case, it can't be seen from the outside. Even though other colored Speck shells fit the same way, this color somehow looks less like a shell and more like an integral part of the computer's design. Perhaps it's because of its more neutral color or lesser degree of transparency than some of the lighter colors, which makes those other colors look like add ons.Aside from those differences, the other colored Speck cases I have are of the same design, and will offer the same protection.  This particular one has more of a "professional" look and feel to it, but Speck cases in other colors might suit you better depending on your preference. Regardless of your color preference, there's a good chance that there will be a Speck case to your liking. The lighter colored ones look more like shells and there's nothing wrong with that. They still look like they belong on the computer, but the others look more like designer add ons, while this one gives the impression that the computer's body is made of its material.

$review_text.: I have been running with a Garmin 410 for some time which still works fine.  The 620 features including vibration alerts were beckoning me.  For weeks I delayed buying the 620 because of the negative reviews about the accelerometer and the light screen.  This weekend I finally bought it and today I had my first run.  While it took some time to set up the watch and getting it to work the way I wanted, now that I have more or less figured it out...I really like it.  The touch screen works for me very well and responsively.  The four fields to a screen is great.  The new dynamics are interesting.  I guess that I'll get to judge the watch better over time but so far it was well forth the upgrade.  I can only assume that out of all of the units some there have to be some lemons and those get the nasty reviews.Follow up:  Well three runs in and the watch is excellent.  The GPS works well and gives an accurate result.  The calories reported are lower than with the 410 but that may be a newer algorithm.  Still learning the features but so far happy with my purchase.

$review_text.: It is hard to find a case for my Kindle Touch for some reason..Guess I missed the boat back when I bought my Touch, and disliked spending $30-$40 for a case, which was half the cost of the Kindle itself. So I settled with an ugly but functional case. Not anymore.This case, while is not leather, is an awesome case. It fits my Touch very well, as it was designed for it. Well, you still have to spend around $20 for it, but it is well worth it. Now I can whipp my Touch out in public and not feel like I am cheap! It is a beatifully designed case, nice color and texture, and above all, seems like it will do a good job in keeping my Kindle Touch safe.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for a rather cheap bracket I had purchased a couple of years ago. This bracket is not exactly inexpensive, but I had a rewards certificate from Amazon so I went ahead. The item works very well and the photos taken with the auxiliary flash unit are noticeably better, without those annoying shadows that one gets when using only the on-camera flash. I like the fact that it is easy to flip the bracket when shooting in portrait orientation. The shoe for the flash unit seemed odd at first, but it really secures the unit in place. Even at full price this is a worthwhile gadget to improve flash photos if you are using an off-camera flash unit

$REVIEW.: I had high hopes for these headphones but they really aren't as good as I expected.  They aren't all that comfortable.  I feel a mild and constant pressure on my ears.  I can't wear them for a long time comfortably.  There is a microphone on the cord and a button to pause or move forward or back. They both work well.  The volume control is a slider rather than a toggle switch.  I find it difficult to adjust the volume in small increments.  I either go way too high or too low so I prefer to change the volume on my iPhone.  This is a pain.  Many other headphones use a toggle switch which I can adjust in small increments.  The sound for voice (an audiobook for example) is fine.  For music, I find the sound to be bass heavy and generally kind of muddled.  The sound just never breaks through,  I feel I am getting about 70 or 80% of what I should be getting.  The headphones aren't bad but far from great.  The cord is nice as it is a good length and tangle resistant,  And there is an extra 3.5 mm connector for Nokia, and Samsung and Sony-Ericsson phones.  You don't need the connector for an iPhone.  The headphones fit the iPhone out of the box.  With some mild improvement, these could be really good.  I hope Philips refines them.

$REVIEW.: I'll admit i'm not a fan of big-screens, i think the bigger the screen the more imperfections you can see. This assuming that you don't really need a big screen(which i really don't). There's a lot of ghost images, choppy images... I'm also not adjusted to high def either so it's possible i'm just not ready for this type of TV.Anyway, i think if you NEED a 60 inch get it.. if not really think about it... watching the baseball game from an SD network. it's like watching a 1980's video game all the square edges.And the base doesn't come installed, not sure if this is standard with this size tv or not. It only took about 5 minutes to put the base on thou, and if you have little kids be careful it's a very shaky base. And no way,that i've noticed, to tether it to the wall like my previous 42 inch did.And don't forget to order some 3d glasses to , they don't even come with 1 pair.

$REVIEW.: I just received my Cisco Linksys E4200 wireless router and I am very impressed! I'm about as non-technical a person as you'll find when it comes to hooking up this kind of device, and I was a bit intimidated about tackling the project. I should not have worried at all!The router comes with an easy, 3 step installation process tailor made for people just like me. I put the CD in my drive, followed the instructions, and in about 15 minutes my home was completely saturated with Wi-Fi coverage. It really could not have been any easier. My home includes two Macs, two PC's, a Kindle and a Wii home entertainment system - all are synced and working beautifully. I was a bit concerned since one of my PC's did not have a Wireless card, but there are four auxiliary jacks on the back of the router to accommodate the existing cables, so hookup was not an issue at all.As for the speed, I have noticed a marked improvement in the speed of my internet connection. I can't quantify how much faster, (as I said, I'm not techy) but it appears to work with much better speed.Reception: My house is centrally located on approximately 1 acre of land, and I am able to receive four or five bars (a very strong signal) anywhere in my house. I get about 2 bars of signal anywhere on my property, (which is all I can get on my Kindle in my local Wi-Fi hotspots around town.) I have not traveled beyond that point to test it's ultimate range, but I would guess it is 80 to 100 yards in any direction. If your home is bigger than that, I suspect you're not self installing a router anyhow.I am very pleased with this product and recommend it highly!

$REVIEW.: I wanted a MP3 player with FM radio so I could drown out the noise when I mow the lawn and  to take to work. I work on very loud machines so I wanted to drown out the noise while listening to music. Plus I wanted to better my Spanish by learning intermediate Spanish via Audio books on this mp3 player. It says audio books capable so I'll be downloading my Spanish course soon.First off the cost. Around $37 was all I wanted to spend on the player. The 8gb storage supplied is  more than I need. A few thousand songs, several movies, lots of photos and about 30 FM stations is more than adequate for me. I saw much better rated mp3 players with 64gb capacity for hundreds of dollars. I didn't need that.First off the, ear buds supplied. They worked OK but not what I needed. I got a good pair of padded molded headphones on sale at the Amazon Gold box deal for about $30. The sound is great plus I get more separated from lawn mower noise and heavy machine noise at work.The charging for the mp3 was easy, I just plugged it into my MS Vista laptop with the supplied cord. No big deal. In a few hours my nearly dead new supplied battey accepted its first charge fully. I bought a 1 cent plus shipping house wall charger for the mp3 player from Amazon.With the Mp3 player connected to the computer I installed the internal Songbird supplied software. It was a little time consuming hitting this acceptance and this over again but not really difficult. Then I downloaded 20 songs from my Amazon cloud to my songbird screen and then had them synced to my mp3 player. No big deal... was accepted easily.The small instructions supplied was not very detailed but after several attempts at hunt and pecking while looking at the small print BASIC directions I eventually figured it out. Now I listened to good audio shuffled 20 songs I like. I can install I think about 2000. There was a small sample video installed of race cars and a few sample photos. I checked the supplied camera...seems OK. I have a much better Canon DSL camera I use for better quality pictures. I'll try downloading a movie but its not what I need, mowing the lawn and working on a loud machine at work. The screen is kind of small but the colors are great and viewing easily seen and fun to watch. For what I paid I'm happy.I hit the auto preset on for the FM radio and had 30 presets selected in a few seconds. You can manually preset the stations you want. I tried the radio selection...worked great! This with the downloaded songs I can really use.The slender mp3 fit easily into my front pocket with a nice flexible felt holder with draw strings from another item I bought long ago. So I have cheap protection from the screen being scratched.This little mp3 player really beats my bulky "portable" DVD player I used to wear. Using quality batteries and even using rechargeable batteries it was much much more expensive to use. My Philips go Gear mp3/mp4 player so far has lasted a full 8 hrs on a full charge and is still going strong. I have not really tried the movies yet just the songs and the FM radio. With the separate wall charger I'll be able to charge it at work if the internal battery runs down.For $37 new, how can you beat it? Very satisfied with my 8gb Philips GoGear Vibe mp3/mp4 FM radio, camera player. 4 1/3 stars

$review_text.: This is the 6th Sony camera of camcorder that we've owned.  My wife wanted a slim camera to carry in her purse for shots of the children at outings and such.  We already own the Memory Stick media and NP-BG1 batteries and chargers so a Sony that uses these was our first choice.  No one, NO ONE, else had the new DSC-W150 or W170s on discount other than Amazon when we bought ours.  The Smile technology and child first choice are AMAZING.  The quality of the pictures is terrific but the ease of point and shoot with presets or all auto is great for pull it out on the spur of the moment, turn it on (fast), point and shoot!  The quality of the Very Fine movies is also really amazing.  I know that its still 640x480 video but 30fps and the speed of the new Mark 2 cards makes this usable footage - its not the same as our Sony DVCs but its good enough and its with us ALL THE TIME!  Wow.  Great 5x optics, wider angle than the W150 (which is nice as many slim cameras make it hard to do photos of groups unless you are way back), and it uses the NP-BG1 and newer NP-FG1 battery packs so its compatible with our DSC-H7 and its support materials!!UPDATE: Nov 12, 2008:Well, we've had it for several months and two big trips.  We took over 2000 photos with it during our week at Walt Disney World.  I also had my Sony DSC-H7 with us.  After the first day and comparing the two sets of photos that evening, I carried the W170 for the rest of the trip.  Its SO much smaller, took great photos, and was easier to use (also was easier on the battery) that I took more photos than I otherwise would have with the bulkier camera.  The Videos, when converted with Vista to DVD, are AMAZING!  Are they as good as our Digital Video tape Sony?  No, but then again this camera is 1/10th the size!  Just plain impressed with the performance of this little camera.

$REVIEW.: This year I built a small home theater in my basement

 I have an Epson 5020UB projector, Panny and Samsung BluRay players, Denon X4000 receiver and a 106" screen
 Projector is about 12' from the screen

All I can say is WOW
The picture is amazing

 3D is better than the Regal Cinemas.So after reading many review and surfing the Audio/Video forums, all I hear is how great this Darblet is
 One after another


 I do notice though the ones who give it a bad review on here really get attacked

 Well low and behold, I purchased a DARBLET
Why not make my theater even better?After hooking it up to my theater, I sampled many blurays
 Star Trek (2009), Braveheart, Up, Olympus Has Fallen

 Some samples off Netflix


 And OTA antenna broadcasts


 I've tried all different settings on the Darbee

 The only difference I see is some sharpening

 Nothing extravagant

 I photograph and use Photoshop's Unsharp mask but mainly the sharpening tool in Lightroom 4
It reminds of using these tools

I saw nothing groundbreaking


 I even went on AVS forums and asked if I was doing something wrong

 One suggestion was leave it on for a week and then shut it off

 You'll notice a difference then

 Huh?Anyway, I'm returning this back to Amazon
 They are even paying for the return shipping
 I feel as though this device is nothing but electronic snake oil

 But hey

 If you bought one and love it, all the power to you...

$review_text.: I purchased this netbook in January based on quite a few factors, including very detailed user reviews on Amazon. I upgraded the memory to 2GB, bought a pretty skin for it, and started dragging it everywhere with me (in my purse, with a protective neoprene case to keep dust out). After 6 months, here are my conclustions:1) I definitely purchased the right netbook. This is an awesome little machine. It's like the little netbook that could.2) The 2GB memory upgrade is essential3) Find an updated online guide for the most useful Netbook apps. You'll find light apps that will help you get the most of your netbook's productivity without sacrificing precious screen area or limited CPU cycles. They also help recommend apps to add functionality to the netbook that you wouldn't even think you needed.4) OpenOffice is a great, great free application that doesn't bog down your netbookNetbook is best used for:Writing on the goWatching moviesDownloading thingsPros1) The battery life is ridiculously amazing, depending on what you are doing and what battery mode it is in2) You can have more apps running than you would think3) The screen is beautiful4) The builtin camera is nice and easy to use5) The sound is really good6) The keyboard is easy to type on - I wanted the chiclet style, and it works greatCons1) The 2 finger scrolling thing never worked great for me, possibly because of the type of skin I put on it. But the trackpad is so small that the 2 finger commands and features seem kind of pointless2) The battery did NOT last as well in sleep or hibernate mode as I expected3) The wifi was really really finicky. It was, in fact, kind of crappy. I was constantly having to reset my wireless router at home and my friends/family's houses to get it to connect. It was also constantly having to repair its connection and would sometimes drop unexpectedly. Meanwhile, my full sized laptop, my iphone, and/or my ipad would be using the same wireless connection without a hiccup4) It would not reboot or come back from sleep/hibernate nicely. The reboot issue was almost constant, but the waking up issue just happened periodically. In both cases I would have to fully power down the device and start it up again to get it to come up. I tried updating windows and the Asus update (including Bios updates) to no avail.5) Streaming video really sucked. Movie playback was awesome if the media was on the drive, not if you were streaming content online. This may partly have been due to the wireless issues but I suspect it just didn't have enough cache to buffer properly. I added an SD card to boost performance and tweaked many settings but nothing helped with the lack of buffering. I could not instant watch netflix or youtube videos on it at all because of the constant stuttering. There may actually have been a problem with the wireless, I never contacted support about the issue because it didn't really matter to me.I primarily purchased the netbook for the extended battery life so I could write or watch downloaded movies while traveling and it did exactly what I wanted. The cons I listed didn't impact me that much because I have so many other computers etc that I would use for those activities anyway. For someone who really wants to stream video or for whom the connectivity issues would be more than a minor annoyance, I'm assuming that contacting Asus support would help to resolve - I don't know if that is a common problem at all.I'm using the past tense because I recently purchased an iPad and just today sold my netbook (sad! I will miss it!). The iPad has a slightly larger screen area which is making a big difference for me - and is significantly lighter than the netbook. Also, the wifi works better. No USB ports, which is what delayed me in purchasing an iPad until now, but I decided to get over it.

$review_text.: This is not a good review for a couple of reasons.  I needed an external hard drive enclosure to take to Afghanistan with me and this was what I purchased.  it did not survive.  I can't say that this review is worth much though because I didn't really expect it to survive.  I did buy another item that did survive very well, and I still use it 3 years later, but this item simply was not up to par.  I don't really suggest this for anyone.

$REVIEW.: I bought 2 sets of Cyber Power 1090 surge protector because I had great experience with its UPS 800AVR units.However, whenever I print anything on my Cannon MP830, my screen would wobble by very tiny amount. Its barely detectable but is definitely present. My 5-year old APC surge protector PER7 did not exhibit this problem.This is not the same high quality build as CyberPower's UPS. If you want UPS I recommend CyberPower. If you want good surge protector with good line noise filtering then go with APC.

$review_text.: I got the HX9v as soon as it came out this spring


 It's pretty much the perfect, top-notch pocket point-and-shoot


 In fact, I carry it with me in my right-hand pocket at literally all times
 I have taken several thousand photos with it so far, and several hours of video
 I am very happy with my purchase.The video is amazing, with many options, zooming while shooting, stereo sound, great auto focus, fantastic in low light
 Keep in mind that for the highest quality setting, 1080p/60 fps AVCHD, if you want to view it on a Mac, you'll need to have the latest version of iMovie '11, running on at least the latest version of Snow Leopard (OS 10.6.8)
 Of course, you can now upload these .MTS files directly to the various on-line sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Google+/Picasa, and you can view them on your HDTV through the mini-HDMI out (which is great)


 But for saving and viewing on the Mac, the AVCHD modes introduce a couple of extra steps and are not simple drag-drop-and-play


 If you don't have a Mac running the above specs, there are still some good workaround options out there

 After a lot of searching I found "ClipWrap" to be the best option for dealing with these files

 But overall, I can't say enough about just how fantastic the video on this camera is

 I've been hundreds of feet away at a concert in the dark, and taken footage that makes it look like I'm sitting right in front of the performer in a well-lit space


 With nice-quality stereo sound


 And all of this often on "only" the best 1080 MOV setting, not even dialing it up to the top-notch AVCHD


 It's amazing, really.The 16x zoom is fast and very good
 Things get a little noisy when you crop and zoom in on a shot that you took at maximum zoom (basically blowing up a shot to the center 1/9th of the frame after shooting at max zoom)

 But that's to be expected

 16x is fantastic and I use this feature every single day for nature shots - particularly birds.There's also a very nice feature one turn of the dial from auto mode that mimics the shallow depth-of-field in DSLRs

 It takes two shots, blurs one, and then stitches the two together so that the subject is crystal-clear but the background is nicely blurred

 I have gotten some very nice shots of flowers and animals close up with this, though the subject does have to be pretty still for it to work right.Speaking of flowers, the macro capabilities of the auto modes on this camera are FANTASTIC

 Reason in itself to buy the camera

 I can be on a walk, with my very big dog pulling in one hand

 I'll see a very pretty flower and tell him to "wait" and "sit", while using my other hand to slide the camera out of my pocket and turn it on


 I just hold the camera up close, click, slide it back into my pocket, and we're off again


 Whole process takes maybe 2 seconds (unless I choose to take a couple of angles, etc.)

 This has been the case for nearly every one of my "local flowers", "Yosemite wildflowers", and "super macro" shots in my Flickr account taken with this camera (basically everything shot in the past few months)

 My Flickr handle is RobertCross1 if you'd like to check out any of my shots to see for yourself.I generally don't use the in-camera panorama features


 While they are certainly very good for what they are, you can get much better panoramic shots by shooting consecutive, overlapping stills and stitching them together in a software application like Photoshop Elements.I also don't use the in-camera HDR feature
 It just isn't very well implemented and produces pretty strange looking shots, even for HDR
 If you want HDR photos, you can exposure bracket with three shots in very quick succession (as this thing shoots at 10fps, a tripod is not even generally needed for this, as long as you have a fairly still hand), at -1, 0, and +1

 Not quite the range you'll get from a DSLR, but I've gotten some nice results putting them together in Photomatix.As for the battery charging in the camera situation, you can easily buy an external charger and a second and/or third battery

 Then charging the battery in the camera becomes a nice second option


 Do a quick search here on Amazon

 The one I got was an external charger and TWO extra batteries for a total of $11.16, and free shipping with Amazon Prime

 They're third-party, but work great


 In fact, they're better than the battery that came with the camera, as they actually show the time remaining next to the icon on the screen


 They say "Fits Son


NP-BG1" on them.The GPS is a nice feature


 When shooting at home and around town, I keep it turned off, to save battery power


 But it's good for road trips and hiking especially, when you're often shooting from a place along a trail that might not be marked on a map or easy to see in satellite view

 It does take a bit for the GPS to reconnect every time you turn the camera back on, so not great for quick pull-it-out-of-your-pocket-and-shoot situations


 But a nice thing to have.As with any point-and-shoot, there's a tendency in the auto modes to overexpose a bit in bright daylight settings

 Just be aware of this and make good use of the various manual settings "P" and the three "M" modes on the dial
 Also, the "custom" button on the top can be set for various things, but I've got it by default on exposure compensation

 So, if shooting in auto, I can make a couple of quick clicks to darken the scene until the sky goes from white to blue


 The changed setting resets when you turn the camera off, but it is really good for quick changes on the fly
 In manual shooting mode, however, the changes you make stay that way when you turn the camera off and on, which is great when you're out shooting a bunch of shots in similar light conditions.As for color, it's generally great, but the reds do tend to get overblown a bit
 Watch for that


 If shooting something predominantly red, you may want to shift to the R "Real Color" setting

 The default is standard, but there are "Vivid", "Real", "Sepia", "BW", etc


settings as well.My wife's camera, the Panasonic Lumix ZS3, which I was using before I got my Sony, is a wonderful point-and-shoot, and it may have a bit of a better lens, as it doesn't have the reds issue, and never introduced geometrical distortion around the edges of the shot


 The HX9v does do this a bit, but this is pretty standard for point-and-shoots, and is easily fixed in software in the very few instances where it becomes noticeable.But we're talking real fine-tuning stuff here
 In every other way, the HX9v blows away the Panasonic ZS3 (and ZS7 and ZS10, for that matter)


 I'd say that the daytime image qualilty still is top-notch, and low-light shooting is on a completely different level

 I never, ever use the flash

 The two auto modes are both fantastic


 For most of my daytime shooting, I actually tend to stick with the regular auto (as opposed to the Superior Auto+) setting, as it is much, much faster


 This is because it doesn't use the various multi-shot-and-stitch-together-in-the-camera features that are only in Auto+

 In fact, in daylight settings, I don't want the chance of Auto+ selecting the HDR function and giving me a weird-looking shot
 And regular auto also gives you the option for continuous shooting with two clicks of the wheel, which is unavailable in Auto+


 It can do 10fps or 2fps at full size, which is AMAZING for a point-and-shoot


 But unlike a DSLR, the buffer is small, so after 10 shots, it has to process and save to the card


 I have a class 10 superfast card in it which speeds this up, but 10 still seems to be the limit of continuous shots per click-and-hold


 So I usually have it set at 2fps, which can give me up to 5 seconds of dog running or bird flight motion shots.Overall, a truly remarkable camera that was one of the best technology purchases I have ever made
 I would highly recommend it.There's a Flickr group devoted to this camera that you should check out


 My most recent ten or so shots on there are very near the top of the pool, and they give you a good idea of the range of the camera, from 16x zoom mountain shots to low-light concert stills, to very close-up macro


 Here's the link:[...]But if that gets disabled on Amazon, just do a search on Flickr for "HX9v"
 It'll be right there at the top


 And here's a direct link to my Flickr photostream, if you want to poke around through what I've done with the camera

 Basically anything done since early May 2011 (and each shot tells you which camera it was shot with right above the map)


 Keep in mind that Flickr is not the place for video (very poor compression with all kinds of artifacts - not representative of the camera), so don't even click on any of those
 Here's the link:[...]Again, if that gets disabled, just do a Flickr search for RobertCross1, and you'll see my photos.Good luck with your choice, and happy shooting!

$REVIEW.: I have been using this tripod for almost 2 years and would review it as good for the price.  The only problem I have had is the bottom hook keeps falling off.  No matter how hard I screwed it on it kept falling off.  It is now a problem now because it fell off and I lost it. This tripod will not hold the image picture on my camera (canon 60d).  When I let go of the camera it droops down.  But for the price it does ok.

$review_text.: I got the Beats by Dre headphones to complement my Sennheiser OMX 95 clip-on earphones. The design is absolutely fabulous, sure to turn heads everywhere. Shiny scratch-resistant plastic with brushed metal trimmings which folds into 3, with the middle bit (which goes over the head) slightly padded.The cord is removable and comes with volume control which controls the volume of your device directly (unlike my Sennheisers which control the volume independently of your device, resulting in a higher volume attainable), as well as a middle button which allows you to pause (press once), skip forward (press twice), or skip back (press thrice). It also has a mic which allows use with your phone (iPhones and BlackBerrys specified on the box).Also supplied is a nice soft cleaning cloth (treated with anti-bacterial), and a lovely padded carry case which has an inner sleeve in which you can store the cable and cleaning cloth.How does this perform? The soft padded cups sit on your ears, cutting out most ambient sound. Long use does result in sweaty ears though. If you are into bass/beat heavy music, this is definitely  for you. Bass is rich, deep and with no distortion. Without any equalizer settings on my iPod, songs like "On And On" by Erykah Badu, "It's Only Love" and "I Feel Love" by Donna Summer, sound like you are in the studio or concert hall with the artistes. Classical music like "Pie Jesu" by Sarah Brightman, and "Agnus Dei" by Luciano Pavarotti will make you swear you were in a cathederal. However, treble doesn't sound as crisp (my Sennheiser wins here), slightly noticeable on some Alternative and Punk Rock like "Talk Show Host" by Radiohead, or "Sunday Girl" by Blondie, requiring different equalizer settings on your device.I'll give the headphones 5 stars for design, and 4 stars for sound.
$SUMMARY.: King of the Bass!

$REVIEW.: I received this product free of charge and had the ability to test it out. I've had a TomTom for a couple of years now and it had its weird moments. I was actually excited to get a new one and didn't really care what brand it was. Here are the positives: The big 5 inch screen. Just beautiful and vivid, great colors. It is nice and thin-really an attractive piece of technology all together. Really like the spoken turn by turn directions that include street names. Haven't tried updating the map, but lifetime updates sound great to me.Here are the bad points. Typing. I practically have to punch this thing to get it to register and it's taken me forever to enter an address. My old TomTom wasn't even like this. Sometimes, when driving, there is a weird delay in the picture and I can't tell what road to take until I've pretty much passed it. I mentioned I like the street name announcements. Well, a weird quirk is that it doesn't ALWAYS voice them. The last time I used it it didn't speak the street name for nearly five minutes. The menu is OK but could be a tad less confusing and I wish I didn't have to search through a million different pages before finding the option I needed.So, my personal, final verdict: If you are going to pay a decent amount of money for a GPS, stick with Garmin or even Magellan, which seem to have on average, far less complaints.

$review_text.: Had the opportunity to use this little device over the holiday.  It does a very decent job, the quality of the sound however over my stereo system is not at the same level as what the same music sounds like in the car.  Now that may be that the auto sound system is not as picky as the AV system in my home, but for general listening and background music it works just fine.  For the audiophile who is used to listening to music via a high quality player it will not be the same.  Nor will it be as good as wiring your ipod or phone directly to your system with an audio plug and RCA plugs. This item does require direct line of sight between the source and the NFC receiver.  Even with your body between the two it will cut out, so you can't really carry your phone all over the house and have this device pick up the signal.

$REVIEW.: The Good:- Great sound- Surprisingly stylish- Slide in/out mouthpiece ensures you won't lose your mic piece ever again- Comfortable with a smart and flexible head band- Works well with iPhone 4, so that you can answer phone calls and get back to listening without taking off the headsetThe Bad:- A learning curve involving the tiny switch that controls calls and music controls- Music can be heard outside the headphonesThe Bottom Line:First let's talk compatibility of this headset:The remote and mic is supported by iPod Nano(4th gen and newer,) Ipod Classic (120GB and 160GB,) iPod Touch(2nd gen and newer,) Ipad, Iphone(3GS and newer.  The remote only, but not mic is supported by iPod Shuffle(3rd gen and newer.  However, Audio itself is supported by all iPod models.This is a great set for your music needs.  A slide in and out mic piece is great.  If you don't need it, just slide it in and don't worry about losing it.  The thin cord is about 3.5 feet in length.  Learning the remote may take some time as different combination of clicks do different functions(click once to Play or Pause and fast-forward requires two click and a hold.  Headband is flexible and very comfortable.  It also long hair-friendly and a flexible band can hold the hair back and not let it escape.  I also found that music can escape and be audible by whoever is around you.  While this could be a plus for some, it can certainly be annoying for the rest of us who are not interested to hear what you are listening to.  Overall a solid choice if you often find yourself using an iPod and computer equally.
$SUMMARY.: Great headset, if you don't mind a little learning curve.

$REVIEW.: The Elura 100 is an impressive camcorder for the prices [it was going for in mid-2006].  Good low-light performance for a sub four-hundred camcorder (in fact, even good low-light performance for a sub six-hundred camcorder).  The video quality is great (hard to believe what's coming from this bargain).Months ago a few people ran in to problems with bad motor parts making terrible noises on their recordings, but my new Elura 100 doesn't suffer from this problem.  Like most other budget MiniDV camcorders, you can hear a soft, high-pitched whirring from the motor in quiet filming, but the Elura 100 has an external mic jack that could eliminate this common MiniDV characteristic when you need to.The Elura does suffer from some design flaws.  The rear controls are a LITTLE awkward at first (the Power/Record/Playback switch can be really hard to activate when holding it at certain angles), and the top mounted zoom buttons are poorly placed.  But these are things you can get used to and eventually not notice.  Least important to me (must perhaps most important to some), this thing is ugly.  There are some nice looking budget MiniDV camcorders out there, but this is not one of them.  An excellent camcorder review site said that the Elura 100 is all about function over form, and I have to agree.All and all though I'm very happy with my Elura 100. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can't afford to spend much on a camcorder, and can handle turning in some comfort and style for a better end result.

 The sound is great and the zipper design definitely keeps things from turning into a tangled mess
 However, if you're moving around the zipper portion of the cable will transmit a lot of noise into your headphones if it is rubbing up against anything


 Since I primarily use these for studying or air travel, I'm not too concerned but this could be a significant issue for some, especially if you're going to use this while exercising.

The only real issue I've had with it is a lack of a pause feature (if it's there, I can't find reference to it)when executing a macro.  The problem I had was when I programed one of the macro buttons to turn on the TV and then select the input for whatever function I was associating with that button (blu ray, for example)the TV wouldn't even turn on by the time the command was given for the input, thus making the process fail.I did figure out a two button work-around.

$review_text.: Hewlett Packard Photosmart M407 is a nice little digital camera that is small enough to fit inside your pants pocket

This camera is one of the best buys around among cameras with greater than 4 megepixels and while there are better cameras on the market, this is a very nice one for the money.My favorite qualities of this camera are its size, its ease of use, and its sharp resolution
Pictures can be taken in VGA (lowest quality) or in 2 MP or 4MP resolution


These higher resolutions are going to eat up more memory but they produce sharp, clear photos

For everyday picture taking, I have found the VGA to be just fine, but for someone who is more experienced as a photographer, the 4 MP setting is needed to produce the sharpest images
The ones you get with this camera at that resolution level are very good, but you need to keep in mind that the memory (without buying a memory card) is capable of storing only about 10 images at this level
Lower the quality to VGA, and you can store about 160 images.Some of the disadvantages of this camera include its video capabilities and the placement of certain buttons and controls

The video is offered with an MPEG format and it produces images at 30 frames per second

Its quality isn't very good and I recommend it only to people who really need/want to take a video and have no other alternative

I don't like the placement of the video and picture shutters on the top of the camera either


The picture button is larger than the video shutter, like it should be since it is used more frequently


But the picture shutter is placed to the left of the video shutter on the top of the camera


The picture shutter is used more and it should be on the right side because, to most people, your instinct is to press the button furthest to the right
I cannot count the number of times I have accidentally pressed the video button by mistake.This camera comes with batteries, two USB cables, a strap, a user manual, and HP image software
This software is nice because it helps new photographers organize pictures and upload them into a pc
The other additions are expected with a digital camera but they help aid in the usability of this electronic device.Overall, HP Photosmart is a good digital camera for the money and it is one of the few that offers more than 4 megapixels at such a low price

It was the first digital camera I ever purchased and I haven't regretted making the buying decision.

$review_text.: I recently installed the new Sony BDP-S780 blu-ray player along side my old Sony BDP-S570 blu-ray player connecting both to my XBR-LX900 TV through a Denon 3311CI receiver.  My initial non-scientific observations/opinions:Pros: ( so far)The S780 is very similar in appearance to the older Sony BDP-S570 ( A bit shorter from back to front)Power-on/off seems to be faster than the S570Disk load times seem to be the same as the S570Bluray image seems to be slightly better. I was able to confirm better cadence test results on the S780 using the Spears & Munsil High-Def Benchmark Disk ( connected to my LX900 TV) : The S570 performed well on the 2-2 cadence test and failed all the rest of the cadence  clips. The S780 performed well on all the cadence test clips.S780 includes Vudu video streaming service which includes 1080P (HDX) and Dolby Digital "+" .  It also lists Cinema Now is "coming soon".  The other streaming video apps/services seem to be the same as S570 ( Hulu +, Netflix, Amazon etc.)The Vudu user interface on the S780 is really very nice ( a big surprise).  Vudu offers SD,HD and HDX ( 1080P) with Dolby Digital +.  I am able to process the Vudu Dolby Digital + streaming sound signal on the S780 over the HDMI cable.  ( I could not process Dolby Digital from Amazon on the HDMI or the Optical Cable with the S570)There is no on-board memory on the S780--However I plugged in a 8GM USB drive which works perfectly.  The S570 has 1GB of on-board memory.The iPhone Media Remote 2.1.1 app works fine with both the S570 and the S780.  In fact its much easier to use the iPhone Media Remote app keyboard when you need to type information on the Sony Blu-ray player.  I found the remote on both the S570 and the S780 to be very similar and for me trying to type information on the remote is a real chore--the iPhone is much easier and efficient.The S780 includes a web browser--this is a nice feature--albeit slower than a computer, it's still interesting and will hopefully continue to evolve with future updatesSkype on the S780 is a real treat--works very well and is a big hit in my house.  We used a cheap Microsoft laptop webcam (LifeCam NX-3000) which worked fine.  This will suffice until I am ready to spend another $150 on the Sony Skype camera (CMU-BR100).  Note: I wasn't able to use my Logitech HD webcam--It doesn't appear to be compatible.and as noted by Amazon.com customer reviewer Ralph Michalske, "The "display" button now gives you the data rate of your A/V Internet stream."  This is VERY helpful when streaming video.Cons: (so far)**S780 USB input does not seem to recognize the iPhone 3GS or 4G at all.  I get a "USB device not supported message."  The S570 USB input DOES recognizes the iPhone but only processes iPhone pictures ( no iPhone video)There are no photo apps on the S780 photo menu--I called Sony support and they confirmed there are no photo apps on the S780.  The S570 lists several popular photo app services.

$REVIEW.: As the owner of a Canon SX50 IS, I didn't know if buying an external flash would be an excess, but using the pop-up flash a few times convinced me that I really needed something to bounce the flash and get rid of red eye, harsh skin tones and all the other woes of direct on-camera flashes.  I cannot speak to its use with DSLRs, but for the SX50, it is perfect.  It fits well and is &#34;recognized&#34; by the camera.  Be sure you change the camera's menus setting to flash mode. Other than that, it is ready to go.  The 270EX II also can be used as a slave, which is very handy.  I am playing with an off-camera cable to get those side or downward flash experiences. A good diffuser is also recommended. Be aware there is no &#34;test&#34; button to fire it manually, but after attaching it to the camera, I found that a half-way shuttler press (&#34;focus&#34;) gave me a test flash. That's a nice trick to know if you want to preview the shadows it might cause.  Another great Canon flash.  A good diffuser is also recommended.  All in all for $150, this is a good, lightweight, very handy little flash.

$review_text.: Got these headphones extremely cheap on a sale. Ignored everyone's reviews that said the headphones were a pretty tight fit, and lo and behold.. they were extremely painful.The headphones are pretty good at this price level if you have a head the size of a small grapefruit. They fit on securely, are adjustable slightly, and have a swivel ear cup to confuse you if you knock into them at an odd angle.The durability is good, as they can take a beating, and they include a travel sleeve, which I stole to use for my other, better headphones I later purchased. My girlfriend also tried out the headphones, and agrees that they are painful to wear for more than a few minutes at a time. Have tried to stretch them out using a soccer ball, but to no avail.If you're looking for quality headphones, don't look at low end prices- you can find much better headphones used/discounted that are exponentially better than these ones.

$review_text.: When you try and tighten this tulip lens hood you can't get it very tight and if bumped firmly it will pop off. Remember too...only use this type of hood on a lens barrel that doesn't rotate too much at the hood end because you get some shadows. My canon stock 18-55 5.6 lens can't be used with this hood because it needs to have the small pedals in the horizontal position otherwise you get a dark shadow on the edge of your image. Because the lens rotates at the end you can't keep the hood in the correct position. Solution?  By a uniform hood that doesn't stick out more than 1/2 or so. Hope that helps.

$review_text.: The replacement screen fit perfectly and the YouTube instructions is an excellent presentation

 However, for the price of the kit, a new home button should have at least been included if not mounted on the screen

When I removed the button from the mass of broken glass I didn't realize that I now had no way of affixing it to the new screen


 No way could I have known that inside the mass of glass chips was the very important rubber ring and adhesive


 As a result, I now have just the plastic button flopping around in the hole of the screen
In order to install a new button I would have to destroy a very expensive screen.Also, the 3M tape was a disappointment

 When I peeled off the backing the adhesive stayed with it.For less than half the price you can buy the complete package of screen, tools, home button and adhesive right here on Amazon


 Too bad I didn't do my homework.UPDATE:I bought a new home button but while installing it the screen became unplugged and after countless attempts I still could not plug it onto the board again


Finally the connecting "cable" broke and that ended the repair project

It cost me another $145 to buy a new iPod for my granddaughter
If a new home button had been included in the repair kit the old iPod would be still working so I'm deducting 2 more stars.

$REVIEW.: The "Zoom" feature of this mouse can be ignored, and is not needed, because you can zoom a lot better in OS X using the native zoom function. In System Preferences, under Keyboard & Mouse, in the Mouse tab, click "Zoom using scroll wheel..." and choose Ctrl. Now when you hold down the Ctrl key and scroll the wheel, you'll get a nice, smooth zoom that looks great and goes a LOT deeper than the MS Mouse function.Now you can re-assign those thumb buttons to do other things. Enjoy.Oh, yes-- I've used mice from every major company, and so far MS has the best ones. I've been disappointed by Kensington (janky movement and bad reception) and Logitech (no decent OS X support) for too long. All my mice are MS now. and they all work great.

$REVIEW.: I love the bag, and I got it thinking it would hold everything I have. It ALMOST does. The problem lies in the open compartment in the top, but that problem is mine, and not one with the bag. If you have one or two bodies, and three or four lenses, it would be great for you. You can only hold three lenses if you have a zoom the size of the 70-200, but four if you have primes or smallers zooms that are able to sit upright. I have three bodies, all full frame (so they're a bit larger), and six lenses and two flashes with about thirty eneloop batteries. I am using every single bit of space this bag has, and the top compartment is holding loosely my flashes and one camera body and one lens. I have my 85L sitting on top of my 70-200 backwards down in the bottom part. Probably not too safe, but I'm looking into Pelicans now. I LOVE the laptop zipper on the back. I LOVE the compartments everywhere. This is truly a fantastic bag, and I have no regrets buying it. I think I will keep it so when I travel the world, I'll have a bag that holds a couple of bodies, a few lenses, a laptop, and some toys for the kiddo in the top. I've never used this as a sling, and while I guess I could, I think I just have it so full that it's so dang heavy I just don't want to. Hope this helps!

$review_text.: I decided to take the plunge into HDTV
 At first I got a Sony LCD (42XBR6)


 The picture was generally very good, but I noticed a persistent "green tinge" in certain scenes, usually in dark areas

 I learned this is called "creeping moss" or dynamic false contouring
I tried having the set repaired, and even got a refurbished replacement from Sony
 I was still having problems, and thought maybe it's me and not the TV

However, I decided to try the Panasonic plasma based on reviews at CNET.From the very beginning, the Panasonic TC-42G10 plasma has been great

 The picture is beautiful

 I kept the picture setting on standard, and adjusted the controls to below 50, for the first 100 hours, for break-in


 Frankly, I liked the picture so much, I now use the standard setting for most viewing
 I use the THX setting for movies (HBO, Starz, DVDs, etc)

Colors are incredible and the black levels are stunning


 I also have a small Samsung LCD TV

 While the Samsung picture is very nice, it really doesn't touch the Panasonic (although, to be fair, the Samsung is a 720p 26" screen).I like to watch things in full screen, even standard definition broadcasts


 With the various format settings (full, Just, zoom), you can fill up the screen without much distortion.The Sony had tons of settings
 I scoured message boards and websites looking for the combination that would give me that perfect picture


 You have far less options with the Panasonic, but I don't really need them

 I marvel at the quality of the picture and am glad I made the switch (a friend took my Sony, and he seems pretty happy with it).

$review_text.: Don't bother with an upgraded SD card.  I bought one from their recommended list and it was nothing but trouble.  Camera kept saying it wasn't recognized after a few days use.  You're gonna have it on loop mode anyways and odds are, you'll only need footage for the few minutes before and after an incident, so having hours of storage space in an upgraded SD card is pointless.  If anything, buy the same exact SD card that is provided with the camera so you can swap out cards after an incident so you don't accidentally over write it.  Which brings me to my next point.  I have had this camera for a solid 3 months now.  After reviewing the latest group of videos to see how things are running, I'm noticing many files are missing.  Really can't explain it.  Hopefully when the time comes to need the camera, I will have the file of the incident instead of it disappearing.Other than that, it works.  Daytime footage is awesome.  Night time is dark and you can only see things that are lit up since there are no IR lights for night vision.  GPS without the antenna takes about 5 mins to acquire and is a cool little tool to have with the moving map.Would I buy again?  On the fence on that.  Better than nothing, but wishing there was something better than this.Update 04/06/2014: Took away one more star. Now the darn thing won't even recognize the SD card that was provided with the camera.....and it still has missing files.  I thought about upgrading the software, but after reading the latest review that it caused more problems than it solved, I don't know what to do.  And I'm going to have to agree, all those 5 star reviews were influenced by the company.

Specifically, I use it on my desk at work and take speaker phone calls coming in while it's playing some soft background music and charging.  I wanted to see how that worked and so I went to the store.  I ended up paying 5% more at store than here on Amazon, but I was glad to support the store person's effort in going over it all for 30+ minutes.One thing you should be careful of is that the dock works with only some of the iPhone 5 cases; for example NOT with the fat protective one I had for my iPhone 5.  But it works fine with those that are a little open at the bottom, including the two standard cases sold at the Apple store for iPhone 5/5S.Sound quality is great.  What else do you expect with a Bose?This one is not Bluetooth and it's not iPhone4/4s -- fine with what I wanted.  If you want to use your ipad or other iphone 4 or other music source, there is an audio plug on back.Note the controls (volume is only control I've ever used) are all on a small remote.  Don't lose it :) or just put it on back of device :)The remote worked right out of the box.  In fact, I just plugged everything in and stuck my iPhone 5 on.  I've never opened the instructions.

After replacing the batteries, we tried to go to the website, which wasn't working.  So, we called tech support, a long distance number, on our dime, to be on hold for a long, long time.  Finally, we got a technical support person whose English was so bad that he was incomprehensible.  And, to make matters worse, he knew nothing at all about the product - we could hear him talking to someone else in the background, asking for help.  Finally, after more than half an hour talking to this person long distance, the only thing he could come up with was to log on to the web site, which doesn't work, and maybe an upgrade would help.  He didn't know for sure, and he wasn't sure what to do if that didn't help.  He did give me a case number, but in order to use it, I have to call back on my dime again to talk to someone else who probably won't speak English either, and won't know any more about the product than this person did.It may be a wonderful product, and the problem we have may have a simple correction, but it doesn't matter how good it is if we can't get help when we have problems.  I'd have been better off to buy a no-name Walmart brand - at least I'd be able to return it easily if it didn't work.What a merry Christmas!  I strongly recommend against ever buying anything you might need tech support on from on line sources, and particularly from this company.

$REVIEW.: Recently we purchased two newNokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile)phones which have microSD slots available to expand on the phone's 8 GB internal memory. We've always purchased SanDisk memory cards because of their dependability and quality. We currently have the following three SanDisk cards in other various devices around the house;SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46ASanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC Card (SDSDQ-032G-A11M, US Retail Package)SanDisk 32GB microSDHC Card w/ SD & miniSD Adapter (SDSDQ-032G-2ADP)That being said there was no question about adding another SanDisk card to use with our family of gadgets. Here are my thoughts on the SanDisk Extreme 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter;Pros+ Extremely fast data transfer speeds (80MB/s).+ Durable and multi-resistant construction.+ Supports Full HD video (1080p) and 3D video recording.Cons- Double the price of other 32 GB cards (currently it's $42.58 as I write this review) as it's essentially double the transfer speed and increased durability/resistances.We couldn't be happier with the SanDisk Extreme 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter. It's fast, reliable and extremely efficient. I've used it in both mySony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tabletand myNokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile)phone with no problems whatsoever. Sure it's a bit more expensive than some other cards on the market but you're paying for the increased efficiency and durability of the card's construction. In my opinion it's worth it in the end if you want all of your devices running at top performance. The SanDisk Extreme 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter another welcome addition to our family of ever-changing devices from a manufacturer we've come to trust.

$review_text.: What more can you say about this product other than it does what is advertised to do? I can say that I bought mine from BlueProton and got Free Shipping and these guys were lightning fast about shipping it to me.It arrived in perfect condition and plugged easily into my USB port and popped my SDHC card into the reader and was able to quickly transfer my Audio books and music to the card without any problems.There are a few people that have commented on the size of the reader being large and interfering with other USB cables. Here is what I have found on this, all readers are made wide to accept the size of the SD card, there is no way around this. If your USB ports are laid out horizontally then you will have to unplug one of the other USB cords to get it to fit. If your USB ports are stacked Vertically there is no problem with it interfering with other USB cables. It is just a matter of the layout of your computers USB ports, either vertical or horizontal. Plain and simple it works.

$REVIEW.: Complaints against some SSDs have included system freezes or crashes (usually blamed on the software controller made by LSI-Sandforce), or that most SSDs lose  performance when they are over 25% full. Our Sandisk Extreme 240GB is 8 months old  and 48% full. When tested (using ATTO/CrystalDiskMark/AS SSD) , the results are very close to when the drive was brand new with Windows 7 freshly installed. And the system has not crashed once during all that time. It seems Sandisk engineers worked hard to get the bugs out of their software before releasing this SSD onto the market. Small files make up the bulk of what we do on computers and this Sandisk model also reads and writes small files very fast, even compared to many models that came out more recently. I would say Sandisk is one of the top reliable SSD brands along with Intel, Crucial, and Samsung. You pays your money and you takes your choice. One thing you should do with any SSD after installing Windows 7 or 8 (or after cloning an existing Win 7 or 8) is to run (or re-run) the Windows Performance Assessment. This set of tests alerts Windows that you are using an SSD and Windows will make important adjustments such as turning off Defragmenting and Pre-fetching which are not needed with an SSD. But, BEFORE you install or clone Windows 7 or 8 on the SSD, be sure to go into the computer's BIOS setup screen and change the hard drive SATA Mode to AHCI  (or Enhanced on some PCs). This will allow the SSD to work at its fastest. Last but not least, Sandisk issued an update for this drive based on customer reports that on certain computers the "write" speed of the SSD may slow down over time regardless of how full the drive is. We did not experience this on our drive nor did any of our friends who have the same model Extreme 240GB. You can download and install the free Sandisk Toolbox (or Toolkit?) from Sandisk's website. It will check your drive's health and also update your drive if necessary, providing peace of mind for all users. By the way, most SSDs set aside some of the storage space to use in case some of the memory "cells" wear out over years of use. After this "provisioning" you will have 223GB of usable space. (Similarly, our 120GB SSD from another brand has 111GB of usable space, and so on). Knowing this before you buy means you won't feel cheated!

$review_text.: I have an inverter on my work truck that I use to use to power my laptop. But the truck has a small alternator and when combining powering the lights for a trailer, AC in the summer, radio, and the laptop, the voltage on the battery started to drop (I was taking more juice out than putting into the battery).When I turn the inverter off and use this instead, that problem goes away. While a laptop doesn't use much power, once you pay for the DC to AC conversion in an inverter and then the AC to DC conversion in the standard laptop adapter, it takes almost double from the car battery as it uses in the actual laptop. I only needed a few 10's of watts to solve the problem and this did it. And for far less than putting LED lights into the trailer would have been.

$REVIEW.: The On Screen Display (OSD) of this ASUS model started to appear randomly and I cannot correct this problem.  The OSD is a small window that should only appear when you press the Menu button so that you can select the settings for your monitor, like brightness, contrast, etc.  Well it looks like the OSD has a mind of its own, and will frequently appear and start recycling through all the setting choices, like a macro gone wild.  I googled this problem, and saw that other ASUS owners of this model have the same problem. I have only owned this monitor for less than a year, so it looks like I can request a replacement through ASUS under the warranty. ASUS support responded quickly to my email - kudos for that! I also own and still use a 19 inch Viewsonic monitor for several years that has been reliable, with very decent integrated speakers.  Before this OSD problem appeared, I was quite satisfied with the image quality - ghosting that others mentioned in their reviews did not bother me (I did not notice the ghosting.).  The sound quality of this ASUS, while not tremendous, was adequate for my needs. Needless to say - very disappointed with this ASUS monitor.

$REVIEW.: Rubber hoods used to be really popular in the 1970s before the petal-type hoods were included with the lens by the manufacturer. So I guess its sort of a "throwback" to the old days (is film next?).One thing this item has is threads in the front so that you can replace your lens cap or perhaps use a filter. Many rubber hoods do not have this feature.While it might be argued that the filter belongs on the lens before the hood to eliminate vignetting, threads are usually desirable on the front as well to keep from losing your lens cap (at least for Nikon lenses).This hood is not for super wide angle lenses - it is for standard or telephoto lenses. If you need a wide angle hood, there are wide angle versions of these rubber hoods.Many times 3rd party photo products are junk, but this one is perhaps an exception as it is made pretty well.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a small (3-4 outlet) surge protector for right near the outlets in my living room, to plug my "always-on" electronics into (as i like to shut off other surge protectors to prevent electronics from using too much power while "off"). So, I got this to plug 3 "always-on" items into. Right now, though, I only have my humidifier plugged into it, since the metal bar behind the outlets needs to be pushed back to plug things into the other three outlets, and I haven't had the patience to fight with it, yet (and I have wrist trouble, so it may take me quite some time to firmly push the metal bar back enough to render the outlets usable).I intend to update when/if I successfully manage to use this item for more than one appliance at a time.Update: On a good day for my wrists, I was able to firmly but gently plug in my router, cable modem, and cable box (which freaks out when I unplug it or cut power to it) in addition to my humidifier. All four outlets are now in use.

$review_text.: I purchased this card for my Canon 7D DSLR and it's video mode (1080p). Since the camera consumes about 4GB per 12 minute clip, this card is good for around 48 minutes of 1080p 30/24 or 720p 60 video. The card appears fast enough to keep up with the high bitrate capture of the 7D's video mode. Be warned, however, it is not fast enough for continuous (high-speed) JPEG and/or JPEG-RAW capture. The 7D can be a speed demon at up to 8fps at full resolution. I also have Sandisk Extreme III cards (30MB/s) and they are noticeably faster. I can fill the buffer with the Kingston card, but not the Sandisk.That said, this card is about 1/2 the price of the Sandisk Extreme, and since I mainly wanted the card for HD Video capture, it performs up to my expectations. I've also had a 16GB version of this card for over a year and used it with my Canon 50D with no issues.I have NOT experienced any data corruption issues with this 32GB card or the 16GB card I've had for over a year.

$review_text.: Presumably most people buying this would already know what it is and why they want it, but I received one to review, so that's the perspective I'm coming at it from. I'm a pretty techy guy, but it was not easy for me to figure out what this thing is or why anyone would want it. Setting it up was easy, but then I just stared at it wondering, ok, now what? I contacted Pogoplug support and at the end of this review you can read through the somewhat frustrating exchange I had with them. Finally, through it all, I figured this thing out. So for those who find themselves as confused as I was, NOW THE SECRET CAN BE REVEALED!!!!Pogoplug is a little black box you plug into your router, and then attach an external hard drive (or an SD Card) to. This then gives you access to the files on the hard drive from any internet connected computer. So for example, let's say there's a document you want to work on at home and at work, or a music collection or video collection you want to have access to from multiple locations, you could put it on the drive attached to the Pogoplug, and then have access to it from any internet connected computer. You log on to their website and can access your files from there.What's good about it?-Set up was easy.-It gives you access to your files from any internet connected device, including your smart phoneWhat's bad about it?-To access the files you need to go through their website or their software. While the device is easy to setup, the software is confusing. There are two versions, the blue "browser" software and the pink software. This is where a user manual would really help. In fact, I didn't even know about the pink software until after my exchange with support. I'm still confused about the difference.-Support is about what you'd expect. Likely outsourced based on the grammar issues in their reply, and their initial answers were not responsive to my questions.Final analysis. I have this thing 4 stars because it does what it claims to do. Whether that's something you will find useful or not is up to you.And now, for your entertainment, my email exchange with Pogoplug support. Draw your own conclusions:I was sent a Pogoplug from Amazon Vine to review. I have it working. I've put files on the device and on the cloud storage. I put the app on my phone. Now what? I really don't understand what this thing does, or what I'm supposed to be doing with it. Given that there is cloud storage, what good is the device itself? What does it do that I couldn't do with the cloud storage? Do I have to be within a certain distance of the device for my phone to access it? Can I access it remotely? How? I'm completely confused. Any help you could offer would be appreciated.===Hello Pogoplug,Thank you for contacting Pogoplug Support.Let me answer your question by telling you what Pogoplug does do.Pogoplug is a media-centric accessory that transforms your typical USB drive into an easy plug-n-play storage from which you can easily share your personal media to friends and family. You can share folders of Movies, Music and Photos easily via email, Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace. You can even create slideshows on Pogoplug and share those as well. This is just a short list of the great features incorporated into Pogoplug and Pogoplug Service, included free for the life of your purchase.Kind Regards,-Fiana===Doesn't really answer my question, but thanks for trying.Let's try this one question at a time:1. Given that there is cloud storage, what good is the device itself?===Hello,Thank you for the update.Let me try to refer to all your questions:Q: Given that there is cloud storage, what good is the device itself?A: All Pogoplug user receives free 5G storage on our cloud. The Pogoplug device allows you to have the ability to both keep the data stored on your attached hard drive on your home and you have the ability to simply eject the hard drive and the ability to access data when needed as well as the ability to attach a large amount of storage to your device (You have 4 USB port which you can attach any hard drive up to 4G).Q: Do I have to be within a certain distance of the device for my phone to access it? Can I access it remotely? How?A: Once you attached a hard drive to your Pogoplug device in the following configuration (Modem -> Router -> Pogoplug device -> HD), you have the ability to view the stored data from remote access from any location in the world via the following platforms:- my.pogoplug.com by signing in with your credentials.- The Pogoplug Browser (Blue icon) - it is mainly meant for preforming backup to your Pogoplug devices as well as to view all the data stored on your Pogoplug. You can download the Browser from the following link:[..]- The Pogoplug Software (Pink icon) - it is mainly meant to map the Pogoplug drives on your computer as well as to turn your computer into your own personal cloud by setting files/folders stored on your computer to remote access. You can download the software from the following link:[..]- Pogoplug App on your mobile device (iPhone/Android)/I hope this information helps.Best regards,Fiana===You state, "You have 4 USB port which you can attach any hard drive up to 4G"There is only one USB port.I'm not sure what you mean by "any hard drive up to 4G". That would be a very small hard drive.===Hello,Thank you for the update.There is 4 USB ports on Pogoplug mobile series 4 (new) device ( you are correct regarding the regular Pogoplug mobile, it has one usb port and one SD card slot).I'm sorry for the confusion the drives you can attach to Pogoplug should be up to 4 TB.Kind Regards,Fiana

$review_text.: I have used this camera for over a month. The video quality is excellent. Picture quality is good. One thing i dislike about it is the pop-up flash location (i am already getting used to it). It shoots great video comparable to a HD camcorder. It is loaded with features and i am yet to test all of them. I like the handheld twilight scene mode which produces good low light pictures. Will totally recommend this to anyone who is looking for an all purpose camera.UPDATE:---------------I am still loving this camera. I had a Pany camcorder which was great but i will have to say this camera produces equally better HD videos (in some cases much better). It is better than my Pany camcorder (it is a 1080i camcorder) since it has options for SD video, 720P, 1080i/1080P and also records in MP4 format. I am convinced and i sold my camcorder! I like the HDR mode to shoot pictures. The pictures are very good in this mode but it takes more processing time. The best feature as far as still pictures are concerned is the Pranaroma mode (it is so easy to use). I still stand by my 5 Star rating for this little guy.

Others have noticed this on other colors so I don't think it matters which color you buy -- you'll have the same issue with all of them.So, the good news is that it looks like it will protect the iPad but as mentioned above, there are a couple of design issues to consider.  I should mention that this is a replacement for a plastic cover that I was previously using.  The plastic cover developed stress cracks and eventually failed which is why I went with the more flexible gel material.  So, the tradeoff is basically a little more dirt and hair and a slightly ill fitting cover for a pretty decent amount of protection.

The system seems to charge up fairly quickly in direct  the sun, and I really like the option of having a 110 watt electrical plug in port on this 150 explorer pack. Purchased this for worse case scenario if we find ourselves with no electricity - it will charge smaller appliances and electrical devices.

$review_text.: This drive looks very striking in black & white, and feels heavy and well-built. It's about 10.5 inches long, so you will need some space on your desktop.The front eject button is touch-sensitive, so don't make the mistake I did and press it hard.PowerDVD 10 software is included, and it can play Blu-ray and even Blu-ray 3D movies.They offer a discount to upgrade, for only $39 you can get the latest and greatest PowerDVD 12 Ultra.I have burned a Blu-ray data disc and it works fine, the write speed is about 20 MB/sec on Verbatim 6X BD-R media. So to burn a full 25 GB Blu-ray disc will take about 20-25 minutes.  Not too bad!Ok so that's all the good stuff.NOW FOR SOME COMPLAINTS:-An eSATA bracket is included, but the cable is only 11 inches long, too short for my motherboard. Most eSATA brackets that you buy have 18 to 24 inch cables.-PowerDVD 10 software can play back DVD movies that have been ripped to the hard drive, but it cannot play back Blu-ray movies that are on the hard drive.  I know for a fact that PowerDVD 11 allows this.-The OEM PowerDVD 10 software has lots of ads and 'click here to upgrade' buttons all over the place.-The power switch on the back is ridiculous!  It's a small slider switch that's recessed into the back of the case, plus it's located between the power jack and eSATA cable, and there's no room for your finger.  What a poor design.  Hey LG, charge us 50 cents more and put a proper rocker switch back there!  It never ceases to amaze me when a product is worthy of 5 stars, and then they make stup1d, obvious m1stakes like this.

$REVIEW.: The first thing you notice is how nice this Diablo headset is on the eyes.  The design is slick and the illuminated red gives off an intense glow that says "I'm ready to play."  The headphones are very comfortable even after 3-4 hours of play and don't build up noticeable heat, sweat, or pressure points.  I'm not sure the headset would work very well with small heads however due to the lack of adjustable ear pieces.The sound is rich with plenty of bass.  The mic produces crisp, high quality sound although it does catch a little more breathing and background noise than hoped.  The headset extension chord also helps especially if you plug it into the rear of your PC.  I tested this game with Left 4 Dead 2 and Battlefield 3 -- the sound and mic performed excellent.Now for the bad.  I found problems with using USB compared to the old style audio jacks.  Sometimes my computer won't re-recognize the headset if it gets unplugged and the re-plugged in.  Other times I have to shutdown the game/app and restart to get the mic to work if I forget to plug in before starting.  I also noticed that while listening to music, rapidly scrolling in my browser would cause audio clicks.  Some windows opening also caused clicks during the music.  Although I have praise for the look of the earphones, I found the plastic audio controller and the base USB connector had a cheap feel and look to them compared to the earphones.  The mute control was also a bit awkward to move, and it is not clear which of the two positions is mute.  The manufactures used a barely noticeably thin strip of red paint to show which direction is mute.The manual also tells you that you can download a tool that will allow you to configure your headset.  That included changing the brightness and pulsating frequency of the lights on the headset.  You can also adjust the audio balance.  What is missing however are any adjustments to the microphone.  I had to use the Window's "Manage Sound Devices" to find more advanced features for both the mic and the headphones -- something that I do not think that the manual mentions.  My original review, in fact, complained that this headset had no sidetone but then someone kindly informed me that was incorrect.  My sidetone setting defaulted to 0 so I just bumped it up and it worked fine.  I think the manufactures should either mention this in the manual or have a more feature rich settings tool.All in all, this is a really cool headset with great sound and a great mic.  Yes, there are a few quirks that hopefully can be worked out with upgrades.  Is it worth the money?  Maybe.  Hardcore Diablo fans will probably want it.

I had read mixed reports of whether the Asus K55a laptop supported 16GB RAM, but this RAM works perfectly in the system.  I ran several applications and heavy resource games and had no troubles whatsoever with the memory.  Window 8.1 now runs with only around 1.5-2.5GB RAM used out of the 16GB, including Intel 4000 graphics shared memory when idle.If you have a Core i5 Asus K55a, and want to max out the RAM, this set is highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: If your looking for speaker cable for any MID-FI system, look no further. This is the stuff to get. I've done some research into cables, around this price category and higher, this is the best performer compared to other brands. It's got just the right amount of strands for this range.Radioshack cables Oxidize, and they've got very few strands so the wire is very stuff and hard to get a flat connection with it. Really expensive cables with a ton of strands will give a better connection, but the individual strands are very brittle and usually cannot be shoved in or out or bent two times without breaking.This monoprice stuff has enough strands for a good connection without being too brittle, the casing is nice and tick, and the copper stays shiny.

$review_text.: I bought this and initially considered it a good deal.  It did what it was supposed to do without any fuss, which was what I wanted.  However, after about 16 months of use (accumulating photos from twenty different calendar days), the product broke while in use.  The section to which the flash mounts and that attaches to the flash bracket broke where it attaches to the bracket.  My flash unit plummeted, but was saved by the cord, which I had secured to the bracket with a twist tie and wrapped once around the bracket's top.I'll be buying a different off-camera shoe cord, and you can be certain I will again affix the cable to the bracket, just in case.

If you keep the firmware up-to-date it's really a top-notch little machine, and manufacturer has been releasing updates for it which is a huge plus
I have no trouble streaming or playing from local storage with no hiccups or stalls and most of the content is in 1080

It does tend to slow down when it's updating apps in the background but really not a problem


Firmware update requires you use the included cable and may be a bit tricky for someone who's technically challenged, i wish Minix did OTA updates, that's probably my only gripe, otherwise fantastic little device, especially with my TaoTronics TT-MK001 remote.

$review_text.: The whole idea of it is great, but Kensington needs to go back to the drawing board and makes some major improvements before this is a 5-star product.Downloading the application off iTunes was quick and easy and syncing the fob to my iPhone 5S was simple.  At first I was like this gadget is going to be awesome, but then things went downhill from there.  I wanted to use it on my BMW keys since I only have one set of them and the idea of losing them brings shivers down my spine. I could also use the button on the fob to find my iPhone if I misplaced it.Now to the ugly.  First the keyhole is too small to fit on a keyring without using another smaller keyring or "O" ring.  It would not move freely on the keychain without a it.  Second the signal between the fob and iPhone has has be very close for it to work...I mean very close.  Like a distance of 50 feet or less.  I guess you can walk around using it like a metal detector until the signal gets stronger to find it that would work.  But the most annoying feature is that the alarm feature goes off easily when the button on the fob is touched ever so gently.  Even if my iPhone is on mute, the slightest touch to the button on the fob will set off the alarm on my iPhone which is very loud.  I could just be holding my keys in my hand, the alarm goes off.  The keys could be in my purse and if something in my purse just slightly bumped the button, there goes the alarm going off again.I finally had to take the fob off my keys and have it sitting in a desk and will use it to find my iPhone if I misplace it.  The whole concept of it is a great, but some improvements need to be made.

Works great in low light conditions, focus fast and along with my tank lens it is just as fast as sound.. click click click! no more &#34;wait a second...&#34; issue i had with my ol d40...it might have some issues as any equipment, i read a lot before deciding to buy this one, but as for me i got a diamond (not a lemon thanks god) :) pretty happy with my purchaseif you are in my case (moving to the next semi pro level) this is the right camera to buy, invest more on a great lens. If you are already a super pro, then go for the d4, i think you would see the flaws in the d7000 as i see on the d40 now..as for me, i'm completely satisfied :)

$REVIEW.: I purchased this router for no real reason than to upgrade from my WRT-54GL (so long old buddy) and get on the N train with USB.I started it up with the default Cisco firmware and immediately started scouring the web for firmware (I used Tomato on my WRT-54GL and LOVED IT). I tried DD-WRT for a couple days but it just wasn't what I needed (lacked multiple DDNS clients). I ended up putting TomatoUSB on and have been very happy ever since. Both my accounts are now updating via DDNS and all appears to be well on the router front.I haven't put a heavy load on it yet (MediaTomb, Netflix, Hulu, Wiix2, PS3x2, Roku and a plethora of wireless phones and notebooks). I read around and it looks like it might get hot, so I'll be mounting to the wall instead of packed in with my switch (that alone gets warm).Also with updating the firmware to an OpenSource version of what ever you choose; they usually enable more file system types on external USB devices as well as adding a Printer to the USB port (I will not be adding a printer since my router is in a Utility room).Highly suggest giving this little guy a spin. It's old enough it's bugs are gone, and new enough you'll be happy with its bandwidth for a couple years at least.

$REVIEW.: i bought this antenna  due to the good reviews posted here and i understand why many people are satisfied with it.however this antenna may not be for everybody.if you are looking for an antenna to get many channels more than 30 miles from your location this antenna is not for you, instead you should buy a long range outdoor antenna.in my case i have a long range outdoor antenna that i use indoor and iam interested in only the channel i watch more,only one channel,  with my powerful  outdoor antenna i was getting many channels but... not the only one i was interested due to poor reception and constant interference because i live nearest to miami airport a crowded area.so i decided to give a try to this rca basic loop model.you must understand unless you live in a good area reception that  this antenna requires fine tuning and could be hard to position it and find the right spot.so...it took me a while when at last i could locate a spot into my condo for my surprise a little far from my big window who i thought it could be the ideal spot,after some fine tuning i could get with a high signal streght of 80% my favorite channel without interference.in my case i use this antenna to get only the channel iam interested in, but of course i get fifteen more channels known to have good reception in my area.this little antenna saved me but i understand could not be for everybody.so good luck.
$SUMMARY.: good if you live in the right area and only interested in local channels

$review_text.: This is a real bargain. The quality and price are quite reasonable. I got it when promised and in perfect condition. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs one. It was for my MIL and it fixed a problem she was having using her new television, Rocket Fish remote speakers and Television Ears she needs to hear programs. This cord provided a way to use the headphone jack to the stereo input jack on her receiver. This solved a long standing problem she had and made her very happy. What can I say - it's always a good thing to make your MIL happy!

$REVIEW.: i bought this to hook my roommates Wii up to my 19" widescreen Samsung SyncMaster 920nw monitor. after hooking everything up, even the desktop was poor quality. everything had a trail off to the right. I switched it to the Wii and got a message saying that it was an unsupported output and recommended 1440 x 900 at 60 Hz. thats EXACTLY what my monitor is set to. after hooking up the vga box i had the option to bump it up to 1600 x 1200, which is what the box outputs. i tried that and still got the error message. so unless you have a super high-reso monitor, dont buy this. and if you get a monitor with that high a resolution, just buy a 480 or 720p tv and save yourself the trouble of dealing with this box.
$SUMMARY.: Must match your monitor PERFECTLY or else wont work

$REVIEW.: The idea is great, but the case/keyboard itself is flimsy and looks cheap. If one is going to invest in an add-on for an expensive item, I'm sure there are better products out there. I had the opportunity to try this and review it through Amazon's Vine Program.My main complaint about this is that the iPad itself won't stay in the groove selected, for propping it to your viewing preference. It just slips off too easily to stay up where you want it to. Bummer! You'd have to add a piece of something (velcro? lol) to keep the angle where you want it.  Also, you'd have to remove the case if you want to use the camera. That may not bother some users, but it does me. I use my camera a lot.For my use, I will disconnect the keyboard from the case and use my regular case (made by ZooGue which is extremely sturdy) with the keyboard, when I need to. My main complaint with the iPad touch-keyboard is that there is no backspace, and I just can't seem to hit the "space" between letters required to edit often enough. If I'm doing a lot of data entry I just prefer a standard keyboard for speed.So bottom line, I would not purchase this for myself, I would do some research on what's out there before deciding what to buy if you need a sturdy case with more functionality and access to all features of the iPad2.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to use with my tablet for recording video with my tablet.  It is easy to use but even though the write up says that it fits most tablets and protectors (cases) it did not.  I was able to modify the holder by extending the adjustable slide side by using a small piece of metal and attaching the tablet holder to that piece.  It now works but it could be a bit more stable.The design is thoughtful but the execution not quite there.  All that said, it does work and if you don't use a tablet protector or case it likely could be used out of the box.  I'd suggest to the manufacturer to make the adjustable holder about 2 inches longer and this review could easily be four or five stars.

$review_text.: So glad I finally found this.  There should be many more options like this!!!!  Why was it so hard to find something like this?  This little guy is just what I was looking for!!!Objective:  While mountain biking, I wanted to leave my (android) phone playing through its internal speaker in my backpack, while still being able to pause, skip to next song, etc.  This little guy does the trick!!!My only beefs are that they didn't read my mind when designing it... it could be smaller and have a clip option (should be exactly same form factor as a Shuffle) and it should be waterproof, to protect from random sweat droplets flying...  ended up taping this thing to my bike's top bar using double-sided tape, would've been much nicer to clip it to my shoulder strap... and I'll probably have to rig some sort of saran-wrap "shower cap" to protect it from flying water...Or how about a true bicycle version with a handlebar mount and everything?  That would be AWESOME!!! Think of the possibilities, Satechi!!!!I do like the buttons, which are fairly "real" and tactile, not some pure virtual buttons...  they could use even better positive feedback i.e. a solid "click" but these are better than some...This guy paired with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus just fine, and work right out of the gate.  Using it with the PlayerPro app (paid version--awesome as well).  However on subsequent reconnects, it sometimes does not work until I go into the keyboard/input settings and do something, I don't know what... anything?  and then it starts working.  But once it is working, it is working solidly for that entire connection session.Kind of odd that this thing emulates an entire "keyboard", but I guess that's what it has to do.  And by the way, I was worried it'd be too big and bulky, but despite my desire for a smaller version, I cannot complain that this is "too big".Now can we please get some smaller, waterproof versions with built-in clips?  And maybe another version with a headset/earphones jack?  ok then thanks!
$SUMMARY.: We need more of these!!!!  works awesome!!!

$review_text.: This charger is what I expected. It comes with a USB cable. One side of the cable is a standard USB, the other is a mini USB. The mini USB fits in my Samsung phone. The charger works. However, I question the durability. I will find out more the durability this summer as I have an off-road bicycle excursion planned. A nice feature is the battery. You can use the sun to charge the battery or the USB port of a computer. Once the battery is charged you can then charge your phone or other device. I give the product 4 stars rather than 5 because of the durability issue.

$REVIEW.: I had high expectations for this camera, which I shopped for very carefully once my first digital camera (a 4mp EasyShare) began acting up. More megapixels, more zoom, image stabilization... it all sounded good.But after taking a number of sample pictures, I'm disappointed, and the camera is going back. I even read the manual... yes... I went that far... and reduced the image size, but I took a pile of pictures under various lighting conditions (in Easy mode), and the pictures just didn't seem that significantly better than that of my Kodak. (I took pictures side by side of the same things.) I will use advanced features from time to time, but honestly, if it's supposed to function well in Easy mode and it doesn't, that's a lost sale for me.Yes, the LCD is huge, but the small LCD on my Kodak is much crisper and brighter. The display on the FZ7 is so grainy that it's hard to see what I'm photographing.  I also don't like that I have to push a switch to toggle between viewfinder and LCD, instead of having both available simultaneously.I also told myself that I really wouldn't mind moving from Easyshare, but you know what? After fiddling with this camera for a day, I miss simply docking the camera to recharge it or transfer pictures. Kodak got that right, at least for this customer. I also agree that not being able to use regular batteries in a pinch is a drawback. The first point is not so much Panasonic's problem, it's a preference; the second point is more universal.On the other hand, the camera seems well-made, it's attractive, it has a nice grip, the buttons and toggles are all well placed, the lens cap is intelligently designed (you won't lose it unless you're trying to), and overall this camera seems to offer a number of features that are nice for this price range. I feel bad giving the DMC-FZ7 this review, because I had a Panasonic film camera for 17 years (it didn't break, I lost it in 2004) and it took many, many wonderful pictures. I was hoping to resume being a Panasonic camera fan. Darn. Back to the drawing board.

$REVIEW.: This is the first standalone charger available for the Sony RX100. (Despite its hefty price, the RX100 did not have a standalone charger included, which meant that you couldn't charge a spare battery while using the camera.) As stated in the product description, it is charger designed for multiple Sony battery types. If you have a bunch of Sony cameras, this is a very nice feature, as it reduces the number of chargers you have to buy or carry.In practice, however, I've found that the design of this charger leaves a lot to be desired. Since it has to accommodate a bunch of different battery sizes, it doesn't fit any one battery type perfectly. There are a series of grooves, springs, and levers to "guide" each battery type into the correct position for charging. The NP-BX1 battery (the RX100's battery) takes up only half the space available, and unless you align the battery perfectly along the right half of the space, it doesn't charge. At least a couple of times I had to jiggle the battery to get the charge going. The overall charging process is fairly quick, and a series of green LED lights shows how much charge the battery has.The charger itself is relatively large (3.5 x 2 x 2 in) compared to other compact camera battery chargers. Again, if you have some Sony SLR cameras, this is not a big issue, but if you only have the RX100 and bought it for its portability, having a bulky charger is somewhat disappointing. At least the outlet prongs fold inward for travel.

 It has nine interchangable tips to match almost any notebook.Compatibility should not be a problem since the charger is supposed to be compatible with over 7,000 models and 10 major brands of computers.I also found it very easy to work with when traveling


 Having the cord be retractable kept my notebook computer bag much less cluttered with cords

Yes if you push the ear pads from the outside they do make a sort of electronic noise you can hear but apart from that well made and sound great.

$REVIEW.: My wife and I will be taking a transcontinental flight soon.  I decided to buy some noise canceling headphones so we could watch a movie on our new ipad.  We don't fly often and my Scottish nature can't justify paying hundreds of dollars for headphones, especially since I have nice Grado and Sennheiser phones for home use. I did some homework and decided to buy these.  I also splurged and bought some [Audio Technica ATH-ANC1 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling On-Ear Headphones. We sometimes take business trips by ourselves and I thought the nicer pair could be used then.For the price, these Sonys aren't bad.  Sound quality is decent, much better than earbuds that come with iphones and the like.  Compared to nice headphones they lack detail and both low end and high end frequencies.  They are adequate for listening to movies but I wouldn't choose them to listen to music. They are comfortable, I don't see any problems wearing them for an extended time.They rely on passive and active means for noise cancellation. Just wearing them blocks out a fair amount of outside noise.  The active noise cancellation does work, but not as well as the Audio Technicas.  I drove some back roads in my fairly noisy truck and could hear an improvement when I engaged the noise canceling circuitry.  It doesn't do well with very low frequencies of rumble.  I think that's because of their inability to handle low frequencies more than the noise canceling circuitry.While I think these will suffice, especially at their bargain basement price, I think you would do well to step up to the next level of headphones, the ones in the $70 to $100 range if you can possibly afford it.

$review_text.: I have two BD burners: HP bd340, and this one. I've had this LG burner for longer, and NEVER have I had a bad burn or read on it. On the HP burner, however, I've lost plenty of BD-R media because of bad burns.The only "problem" I have is the startup notification: Whenever I boot Windows, it asks me if I want to allow changes so that the ODD firmware can run in system tray. When I first had it, I set it to yes and made it not popup again, but since I got a new boot drive, I have to look up how to do that again. It's more of a personal thing and not worth removing stars, especially since you want to make the firmware stay up to date anyways.I'm looking into replacing the HP bd340 since it has bad burns, so I will purchase another one of these, most likely!For those who have black cases, it is a glossy deep black, and has a blue LED flash when burning. I have a black case that has a softer black matte finish, so it looks a bit off, but not that big of a deal for me. Just a head's up!

$review_text.: The case works very well. The built-in stand is very useful, and it holds the tablet very securely, without adding too much weight -- I feel quite sure that my N7 is safe, though it is a bit awkward to type in portrait (it takes a little getting used to the added bulk, especially if you use the stylus loop). The build quality is also quite good, though there are a few minor cosmetic details that only a prying eye will notice.Something worth noting is the elastic band meant to keep the tablet secured when the case is opened: it takes a lot of effort to get it positioned in a way that keeps the tablet secure without blocking 2mm of the right side of the screen, but it is not a serious flaw.Overall, it is a great buy and I highly recommend it.

IN FACT, IN SEEMS TO BE A BIT WEAKER.  I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THIS IS DUE TO THE BLACK DIAMOND OR THE ADAPTER.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE OVER 40 FEET ONE STORY AND FOUR WALLS APART, SO I GUEST I SHOULD NOT EXPECT A STRONG SIGNAL.

$review_text.: I purchased this for my 7D


 The unit and fabrication are good, however, with my 7D even at the farthest setting, there is not enough room for your hands to hold the system ( I am talking about the space between your camera and the vertical bracket)
 Would probably work ok on a smaller camera
I returned the unit with no problems.

$review_text.: I bought this backpack since I was sure that a Nikon 200-400mm VR F4 mounted on a camera would fit in this bag with other equipment.  When I originally wrote a review I was still waiting for the 200-400mm lens.  I now have the 200-400mm VR lens.  It is huge, but fits perfectly in the Vertex 300 AW.  I also have carried a Nikon 17-55mm F2.8 lens, Kenko 1.4 teleconverter, Nikon 12-24mm F4 and many accessories.  The Nikon 200-400mm lens comes with a pretty extravagant case that holds only the lens.  I really needed a backpack that would accommodate the lens mounted on my Nikon D200 camera and an additional camera with lens mounted and accessories.This case is huge, but I probably will not use it if I am not carrying the 200-400mm lens.  In that case I would continue to use my Lowepro AW Mini Trekker which works just fine for the rest of my lens and camera combinations.

Since I primarily use my Macbook as a &#34;desktop&#34; computer with an external keyboard, I bought this keyboard cover to keep dust from falling into the computer through the spaces around the keys.

$REVIEW.: And the pendulum of gadget satisfaction has swung the other way


Previously, I dismissed the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio for iPad Air for its flimsiness in typing mode and its bizarre key-conflations
Still determined to find a suitable external keyboard for my beloved electro-slab, I decided to try out something familiar, Logitech&#8217;s Ultrathin Keyboard Cover.This, unlike the Folio, is not a &#8220;case&#8221; for your iPad, something that would cover it front and back, but more like a faceplate with keys, attached by magnetic hinges like the Apple Smart Cover


When in typing mode, the iPad docks into a magnetic groove, tilted at a slight angle, just above the keys

I owned the previous generation of this keyboard cover for my earlier iPad, and liked it quite a bit, even though it didn&#8217;t get all that much use


When I absolutely needed a physical keyboard for longform writing, it was just fine.Utterly disappointed by the Folio for the iPad Air, I was a little reticent about the Cover

Surely there would be sacrifices that Logitech had to make in order to fit an iPad that is &#8220;full size,&#8221; but still significantly smaller than its predecessors

I feared it would be cramped, and perhaps flimsier or feel more, well, cheap
It&#8217;s clear that both the Folio and the Cover were made before the Air was even finalized, as the marketing materials for both products note them as being compatible with &#8220;iPad 5,&#8221; which of course is not what this iPad turned out to be named
(The packaging has the &#8220;iPad 5&#8221; language artfully labeled over with the correct iPad name.) So there was some trepidation.I&#8217;m pleased to say that not only is the Ultrathin Keyboard Cover working out, but it&#8217;s been a delight to use.First and foremost, it&#8217;s a very good keyboard generally, for a &#8220;case&#8221; or otherwise
I&#8217;m typing on it right now to write this review

While it&#8217;s certainly a bit more cramped than the official Apple keyboard, it&#8217;s not badly so, and the keys feel more solid and responsive than they did on Logitech&#8217;s Folio version


This is about what I remember from the previous generation Ultrathin Cover, though it may be a touch more compact

If so, I can&#8217;t really tell from memory


I wouldn&#8217;t use it for my MacBook&#8217;s external keyboard, of course, but it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable keyboard overall.One thing I particularly liked about the previous generation keyboard cover was that I could, somewhat precariously, use it on my lap

It wasn&#8217;t entirely stable that way, but if I stayed mostly still, I could do some prodictive typing from the couch
With this iteration being smaller and lighter to suit the Air, I presumed the experience here would be as good or perhaps a little worse.Wrong

It&#8217;s better &#8211; far better

I&#8217;ve got the thing on my lap now

Okay, I&#8217;ve got it on my lap all the time

It&#8217;s perfect for couch use
It&#8217;s almost as stable and still as my MacBook Air on my lap, even though the iPad plus the keyboard cover together are lighter than an 11&#34; MacBook Air

The magnetic groove on this cover doesn&#8217;t hold the iPad Air quite as firmly as the previous generation held iPads 2, 3, and 4, but it&#8217;s still much better than the Folio&#8217;s crummy, non-grooved magnetic strip

Still, it means that the functional angles at which you can work are more limited

For example, the keyboard essentially needs to be flat or angled upward on your lap, as opposed to having the keys tilt at all toward you, or else the iPad could flop out of the groove
But this has yet to be an issue for me.One notable drawback from the previous version: iPads 2 through 4 were actually fairly stable in the docking groove even in portrait mode, straight up and down

It didn&#8217;t &#8220;click&#8221; in, but it set deeply enough into the groove to be usable

This is not really the case with the iPad Air version
You can prop it up that way for casual viewing on a table, perhaps, but you likely won&#8217;t get much done that way, and certainly not on your lap, before it topples over

This is really a landscape-only situation.Meanwhile, the magnets on the hinge in &#8220;cover mode&#8221; are incrediby strong &#8211; almost too strong, as I sometimes worry it pulls the iPad to it with too much force

So far, no problems, though
But ideally, I&#8217;d like to see a tiny bit less magnetic pull from the hinge in cover mode, and a bit more strength on the docking groove.Speaking of &#8220;cover mode,&#8221; I have a small concern about using this as my primary cover for my iPad for travel

Normally my iPad lives in an STM Cape, which is mostly fabric and perfectly safe and protective

With the Logitech Cover, I perceive a little bit of give toward the middle of the cover, such that if you squeeze them together a bit, the keys looks like they could mash up against the iPad&#8217;s screen

The cover has little rubbery feet that lift any hard pieces away from the screen normally, but it looks like even a little bit of pressure might mean trouble for the screen

Obviously, I&#8217;m not willing to test this possibility on my device, so I suspect that for anything other than a quick jaunt to Starbucks, I&#8217;ll travel with my iPad in my Cape, and simply carry the keyboard cover as an extra accessory
It&#8217;s not exactly obtrusive.One other nice thing about this being a cover versus a case, is that it wouldn&#8217;t be at all odd to separate the saucer section, as it were

You can dock the iPad into the cover, or prop the iPad up with another case or stand you prefer, and still use the Logitech keyboard to type


They don&#8217;t need to be physically attached to work together.And another nice thing, which is thanks to Control Center in iOS 7
There&#8217;s now much less friction when switching between docked typing and handheld tablet use
With Control Center being accessible at any time, I can disable the keyboard and Bluetooth without going through the morass of menus from previous versions of iOS


Now I just undock, flick up control center, and turn off Bluetooth
Done.To sum up, it&#8217;s really only as a long-term protective cover that I&#8217;m at all iffy on the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for iPad Air


Around the house, it&#8217;s fine, but I wouldn&#8217;t put it in a tightly-packed carry-on for a flight


But as soon as I&#8217;m situated, I&#8217;d probably pop it right out, and dock my iPad into it forthwith.This has turned out to be a great purchase, and I find myself docking my iPad into it regardless of whether I plan on doing any significant writing, for even if it&#8217;s just for tweeting, email, or browsing, this keyboard cover is a great overall augmentation to my favorite object.Originally posted at is.gd/16jUMt

$review_text.: I bought this case to use on a late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro.  I had an easy time installing the bottom piece, but the top piece was difficult for me.  I think I didn't have it slid up all of the way, so I couldn't get the top rim to snap on without enlisting my husband to help me.  It is a TIGHT fit on the top, which is nice, but also frustrating.  I didn't want to put too much pressure on my screen while trying to snap it on and I was also afraid of scratching the laptop by sliding the case.I must say, I'm also nervous about taking the case off.  It is recommended to take it off to clean out any debris that might have worked its way in between the case and the computer.  I'll report back once I've done this a few times and know whether or not the case gets any more flexible or if there are other issues.The case does a good job of covering most of the laptop, though part of the laptop bottom (where the hinge is) is exposed on the long edge.  The corners are mostly covered, but a drop at a certain angle could certainly scratch or dent this exposed area.  Of course you might have bigger problems if you drop your laptop on the hinge area (or at all), but it's something to know.Even though the case doesn't weigh very much, I do notice more heft when I pick up the laptop now.  What once felt fairly light and comfortable, especially compared to our 2006 MacBook Pro, now feels heavy to carry around.  If I hold it in my lap, though, it's fine.This case DOES fit in my TwelveSouth BookArc for Macbook Pro (http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-BookArc-MacBook-Pro/dp/B0098EYM3A/).  Without the case, the laptop fits in the insert with the smaller slot; with the case, it fits in the insert with the larger slot. There is still a little room in the stand even with the case on, so the stand does not put pressure on the laptop while the case is on.Finally, the feel of the case is very nice.  Smooth but not glossy, it feels like a very soft and almost velvety rubber.  The photo is a decent representation of the color, though in-person it looks to have a little green in it as well, making mine look almost teal.

$review_text.: Sony MDR-NC6 Noise Canceling Headphones ReviewBy Lewis LeongWritten in memory of James KimIntroductionIn the continuing quest for a world without external aural distractions, I picked up the Sony MDR-NC6 noise canceling headphones to experiment how well noise cancellation technology actually works.  I already have a pair of Sennheiser CX300 noise canceling ear buds which still impress me to this day with clear audio quality and superb passive noise canceling.  I was curious to see the difference in performance between the passive noise cancellation of the Sennheisers and the active noise cancellation of the Sonys.  While the Sennheisers rely solely on a silicone plug to isolate outside noise, the Sony's active noise cancellation technology relies on microphones located on the headphones to pick up ambient noise and cancels it by producing a counter wave.PackagingThese headphones, along with many other headphones, are packed in the dreaded blister pack where you get severe lacerations just trying to unbox it.  After the brawl with the packaging, you will find the headphones, airplane adaptor, "leather" pouch, and instructions/warranty information.  The pouch is made of a synthetic plastic which feels soft and flexible with a velvet-like finish on the inside.  I would have preferred a sold case for travel and storage but the pouch will do for keeping the headphones clean and dust free.DesignThe design of the headphones is contemporary and quite pleasing to the eye with its silver body and chrome accents.  I especially enjoy the tasteful plastic on the outside of the ear cups that accent the Sony logo and advertises its noise canceling abilities.  As with many noise canceling headphones, there is a need for an external power source to power the microphones which, in this case, comes from a single AAA battery.  The battery compartment is located on top of the right ear cup and the on/off switch is located on the right ear cup as well.  The switch is easily accessible by using your thumb even though it is located behind the headphones.  Initially I was worried that the battery being on one side would throw off the balance of the headphones but they did not, since the headphones as a whole are so light.  The headphones use a single wire design which reduces the chance of tangling and helps to balance the headphones by being on the left, acting as a counterweight for the battery.PerformanceIf I had to sum up the Sony MDR- NC6s in one word, it would have to be average.  The sound quality is average at best, providing better clarity and bass, than stock headphones but not enough to truly satisfy and audiophile.  High frequencies are reproduced without any distortion or discomfort but lack clarity.  Low frequencies are also reproduced without any distortion but lack the punch that you would get with higher quality headphones.  Even with the equalizer adjusted for maximum bass, I was craving more.  One major criticism I have about these headphones is that in certain songs, the drums and cymbals sound very distant, as if the drummer were sitting a different room.I was anxious and curious to see how well active noise cancellation worked but was severely disappointed.  There is minimal difference between having the noise cancellation circuit turned on or off.  The only difference can only be detected when there is very low frequency ambient noise and of very low decibel.  It will get rid of wind and tire roar if you are listening to your music in a car, hopefully not while driving.  The thing I find counter-intuitive about the NC6s is that when you switch on the noise cancellation circuit, the volume increases noticeably.  Isn't the whole point of noise canceling headphones to listen to your music at a lower volume without having to blow your ear drums out from cranking up the music to overcome ambient noise?  It even advertises this fact on the box.ConclusionI would not recommend these headphones for sound quality or noise cancellation but if you are fashion conscious, they might be for you.  Everything about these headphones is average and I was not impressed by them at all.  The sound quality is similar to that of Sony's less expensive, passive headphones and the noise cancellation circuitry is rubbish.  If Sony designed these headphones to passively and actively block out ambient noise, NC6s would have been a much better pair of headphones.  If you paid more than $30 for Sony's MDR-NC6s, you horribly overpaid.  For those who are serious about getting rid of ambient noise, I would recommend ear buds that plug your ear canal such as the Shure E4Cs, Etymotic ER-6i's, etc.

$review_text.: It gets a lot of criticism from from audio/video files because they claim the TVs often carry a blue hue. You can callabrate, but this one was fine.Negatives: Remote is big and clumsy. Has one of the worst sound systems, but almost everyone uses sorround so no big deal. It doesn't have as good a contrast levels as Samsung and Sony's high-end. Customer service was a joke.positives: The colors spectrum is as vibrant as there is-the technology they use is excellent. Well built, a little heavier and more durable then even the most expensive. ABout as much bang for the bucka s you will find in a LCD.If you are a truley picky viewer that demands to have the best available -run as fast as you can because this is not on that level. However if you want an above average HD that is easy to use and has most of the features you will need at a fair price put this on your short list.

$review_text.: This TV is one of two Vizio TV's I have. One is a 47 inch Razor smart tv from 2011, and now this one. Great picture when you adjust settings. The apps work great after the firmware is updated (at least for me) and I hate wireless. Both my TV's are LAN connected thanks to an ethernet switch behind both TV's. Sound isn't that great (get a sound bar). The equalizer option is shaded out so I'm guessing that's not available on this tv, but with a good sound bar, I don't care about that. Wish I could give more info but it seems to suit with fine with Directv HD. I LOVE THE YOUTUBE app! I use that all the time and it works so well on this TV (see question regarding that below)I do have a QUESTION for anyone who reads this review. The 47 inch razor and this E550i-A0 are both smart TV's with the same apps. The Razor TV's Youtube App isn't nearly as responsive as this app. It works, but navigation is very slow... Once you start playing the video's on the app, they play fine, it's the moving up, down, scrolling through videos that's a major difference from one tv to the other. I even cleared all memory on the Razor and deleted apps I never use, there aren't that many that I want honestly, but it's still slow navigation.....If anyone has any suggestion as to why it's slow navigation on one tv, but not the other, let me know.More about the Vizio Youtube app. I LOVE it and I'll tell you why! When it first came out, I didn't like it at all. But Vizio must have updated this. Now when you log into your youtube account on the Vizio app, you can see your uploads, your favorites, people you subscribe to and THEIR playlists! You can rate videos, or subscribe to a channel etc. This Youtube app can do so much more than the youtube app on my panasonic bluray player. I just wish the one on the razor TV was more responsive when navigating.Conclusion: I've had Vizio TV's since 2006. The one this tv replaced was almost 6 years old with no issues. I just wanted to upgrade and the other TV was given to someone and still working.

They're really quite wonderful for anyone looking for fairly dynamic sound in a typical sized living room, and are low enough profile that they don't stick out like a sore thumb on my living room ceiling. They were easy to install, too. Though I have a fair bit of experience fishing wires through walls, so your milage my vary. I will be buying several more to complete my home audio setup.

$review_text.: Purchased to hold our new Canon T2i camera
 The camera fits great in it

 Nice and snug.The top of the case unzips and the camera goes in lens-first facing down.I was able to use the included divider pad as a protective layer to also carry our LCD Timer Battery Grip for Canon EOS 550D 600D / Rebel T2i T3i SLR Digital Camera on top of the camera.The pad has Velcro along one edge to hold it in place.It's a tight and safe fit
 You could also carry a few filters, batteries or other small accessories in the other zippable storage areas on the case.But, if you have several lenses, or other large accessories you will either need another case for those, or a different case altogether if you want to carry everything in one bag.Stap allows it to be slung over a shoulder

Can also be worn fannypack style on a belt.This one is nice if you don't want a big backpack or huge suitcase to lug around.We may outgrow this case some day, but for now it's perfect.



$review_summary.: Great case if you don't have lots of accessories.

$review_text.: I had read quite a few reviews of this lens before buying it for my D300. Some were great and others not so great.  I picked it up to use as a portrait lens for location shoots.  I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.  Some say it's soft at f2.8.  Not mine.  Tack sharp at all focal lengths.  Some say the Autofocus is noisy(loud.)  Not mine.  Or maybe I'm just not that picky.  If noisy means you can hear it then...yeah it can be noisy.  Some say that the autofocus hunts.  Not mine.  In fact this lens focuses so fast I was amazed.  Color rendition is good.  Contrast is good.  Bokeh is nice and smooth.People raved about the Nikon 18-200vr so I bought one.  It's soft and slow in my experience.  It was "ok" on my D70 but its flaws were multiplied on my d300.  So even with the good reviews of this lens I was really worried about buying it but the price made me give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I could easily slip into another good Sigma or halfway decent Nikon lens with the money I saved over going with the Nikon equivalent.  It makes me wonder how their competitor to Nikon's 18-200vr stacks up.My only "complaint" about this lens is that the zoom ring is small, stiff, and at the base of the lens.  It's sometimes hard to get to and a bit backward from what I'm used to.  A minor annoyance is that switching to manual focus is a 2 step process.  The lens will stay in autofocus even after locking the clutch down as long as the camera is still in autofocus.  Be careful with this because you could damage your camera's motor drive if you have a tight grip on your lens. You'll know the lens is set to manual when you try to focus and the focus ring turns on its own.  I also found it odd that the lens is at it shortest when zoomed all the way in and longest when backed off to 24mm.  Strange...maybe I'm missing something here but all my other zooms are the opposite.It's big and bulky.  I actually like this because I have big hands and find it easier to stabilize heavier equipment.  And as dumb as it sounds...it looks good on the camera.  Those out of "the-know" will judge you based on these types of things at times.Nice big lens = professional right?As long as you're a potential paying customer...um...yeah! Of course!I haven't had a chance to try it out yet but I've heard some people complain about lens flare and that hood is useless to protect against it.  I like lens flare and use it creatively in my own photography so it's not anything I would consider a minus. For me a lens hood is something I use to keep from bumping the end of my lens into stuff.  I can see though how people could get annoyed if it's unexpected.  But if you're getting unexpected flare in your shots you're not doing your job as a photographer and paying proper attention to your scene.Update 6/17/2008I've been shooting with this lens for a few weeks now and my above observations are accurate.  However the lens flare issue is a bit more than I thought.  I had a hard time getting the "touch of flair" I like in some backlit shots.  It was more like "holy crap that's a lot of flair!"  The hood does seem a bit useless but I tend to bump into stuff so it's good to protect the end of the lens.  I'd still buy it and fully recommend it at 5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Just buy it

$review_text.: My thoughts:- If you don't care about long-term data retention, this hard drive might work for you (is more than 1 year fair enough to call long-term?).- If you aren't implementing a RAID array or mirror configuration, this hard drive might be OK for you.- If you are a casual computer user who doesn't know what I just said in the last two sentences, this hard drive might be the one you want.Otherwise, please pick a different hard drive.  You'll thank me later.My first experience:I bought 4 of these from Amazon less than 1 year a go, and 2 have gone bad and had to be replaced.  The warranty is for 3 years, so you can go to Western Digital's site and get an Advanced RMA, BUT you have to pay for the shipping!  So 2 of these drives actually ended up costing me $20 more than I paid for them on Amazon because I had to pay for individual shipping (they went bad at different times... of course!).  Lost money on the shipping, lost data that was on the drive, lost the time replacing the drives, lost a couple weeks off my life stressing out about losing the data.  If I knew then what I know now, would have paid $20 extra and bought the other drives the first time.My second experience:A few months later (before the first 2 drives died), I purchased another 4 of these same drives from another site (cheaper with free shipping as well) and found out after the fact that they won't work in a RAID 5 configuration with Windows XP because of XP's 2TB limitation.  I upgraded to Windows7 and thought I was in business but because these drives are eco friendly green drives, they shut off after a certain threshold of inactivity.  Ya, that doesn't work for a RAID setup--can't have drives dropping offline every once in a while.  So after much research I found out there's a work-around to turn this feature off, but WD says if you do this it voids the warranty and they won't replace the drive.  Man, I can't win!  1 year later and I have to buy 4 new hard drives again!My advice:Don't EVER go with cheapest if you value your data.  Is your data, your time, and peace of mind worth the few dollars you save?  Yep, I totally agree.  Pay a little more and buy something else, these drives are NOT the best choice out there.My 1-star rating:That said, based on my experiences, it doesn't seem right to give a drive 5 stars that just sits there and stores files like any other drive out there that has the same exact specs/features; so I would have only given them 4 to begin with.  However, it does seem fair to knock them down 50% of those 4 stars because 50% of the the drives went bad in less than 1 year.  However, some people think 2 stars means they must not be that bad if you gave them more than 1.  I don't understand it but that kind of logic is why I'm giving these 1 star.

$review_text.: The Sansa Fuze is a neat little player for people who like to listen to music for a long time.  I've had it for a year and I honestly can't think of another use for it.The Good:-The screen is a bit small but it's crisp and bright enough that I never needed to use it on the highest settings.  When looking for songs I could hold it at arm's length and have no trouble reading the titles.-The battery lasts an extremely long time.  I charge it for about 15 minutes every 3 or 4 days.  It's never died on me and I've seen the low battery alert maybe once.  I also love the fact that I can hook it up to my laptop or any USB slot.-Over 500 mp3 songs can be stored on it, quickly though Winamp and Windows Media Player.  It would be nice if there was some iTunes support but we can't blame SanDisk for Apple's NO-PCS-ALLOWED policy.-It also comes with neat (but mostly useless) little extras like a clock in the corner, album art display, ability to change the color of the background, radio, equalizer and so on.-The headphones that came with the player are better than most packaged headphones.The Bad:-While the headphones that came with the player were better than most, after they fell apart (Yes, they literally fell apart)I noticed that the Fuze has nearly no bass.  Playing around with the equalizer didn't do anything but make my music sound very canned.  In fact, I'd say that the equalizer really isn't good for much except making music louder.-It's not very sturdy.  The player itself feels cheap and plastic.  A few months ago, the black top layer started to peel off exposing some silver plastic-y material underneath.  More recently, the top half of the player started to separate from the bottom half due to me dropping it a few times.  I have to keep snapping it back on every so often.  I've bought cheaper Sandisk products that I've had longer and they still haven't fallen apart like the Fuze.-If you have a lot of songs, scrolling can be time consuming and just a pain.  There are options to organize songs by Artist, Song Name, etc but there should be a way to get from A to Z faster.The Ugly-THE VIDEO FEATURE IS ALMOST A LIE.  VIDEO SUPPORT FROM SANDISK IS NEARLY NONEXISTENT.  I never tried to put videos on my Fuze until a few days ago when I thought about writing this review, honestly.  But I can count on one hand how many videos I've gotten to work properly on my Fuze:One - A softsubbed mkv, which I had to convert with a user-made program made for the Fuze, that lost it's subtitles and played the video too fast causing the audio to lag behind.Two - A hardsubbed avi converted with the same program but the subtitles were so small that I had to hold the player inches from my face.SanDisk's solution is to offer users a "firmware update" that contains a program called Sansa Media Converter.  However, when updating, the option never appeared for me and since then I haven't been able to get ANY videos working on my Fuze.  I did manage to find a standalone download for SMC but it didn't recognize my player.In conclusion, if you're looking for a decent mp3 player for a decent price, the Fuze is a good option.  But if you're looking for an all-in-one type of device that SanDisk advertises the Fuze as, look elsewhere because just about everything else is useless.

I use this with my foxl v2 and the sound together is fantastic. It is like I am listening to a large stereo. I love listening to music on it. I have also tried it with my JBL micro and it also works great with it. It can be used with any speaker and it will really improve the sound. It is important to set it for the correct amount of bass or if you set it too high it will distort. It would be very nice if they included a usb charging port to power the foxl. This sub woofer is a unique product that will greatly improve the sound of any portable speaker you have.  I truly do not understand how other reviewers could possibly give this 1 or 2 stars. I love it and it is well worth $150.

$REVIEW.: I have read all of the earlier reviews and agree with all the "pros" listed - for the amount of features, ease of use and , size, ability to lock on a signal - there is no better GPSr in this price range.I am an avid hiker, nature photographer and geocacher and I like to be able to recall my trips - document sites, features and sightings etc. This unit didn't let me down. Last weekend I took a day trip that included four different parks along a river system with high bluffs and DEEP ravines - in the car and on the ground, this unit never missed a beat, never lost signal lock.The unit was located in many places - in hand, in the cup holder of a van, in a zipped fanny pack, clipped to a belt, and at lunch, on the table at a tavern - not a problem, never lost signal. :) My last unit was a Garmin Vista Cx - this unit is MUCH better - better lock and faster draw.As far as the "cons" I've read - there are few and most are related to the price of maps, the accuracy of the maps or the manual.Concerning the price of the maps - there is no unit that comes close, at this price, (even considering the price of buying the maps) to this unit in speed and accuracy of plot. Anyone that did ANY research would know that maps are not part of the base price (not that I like or approve).The accuracy of the maps themselves, as far as roads are concerned, is poor (topo maps) - in my area there are major freeway junctions that have not been updated for over twenty years. The topo maps, however, are not bad - if you need road info, get the City Navigator maps.The manual I recieved with the Vista HCx is deficient, find and D/L the manual for the Vista Cx.The Garmin Vista HCx is a great, small, versatile GPSr that will do what you need.

$REVIEW.: I prefer short HDMI cales as interconnects for the various components of my entertainment systems.  This allows me to have clutter free installations that are easy to install and service or change when needed.  This saves you having to sift through endless spaghetti-like piles of cables in often very tight quarters!  This cable fit the bill perfectly.  I have used Aurum brand cables on several occassions in the past and have yet to have a problem with them.  They function as they should and support 3D functions and audio return without issues.  The construction and finish of this cable is on par with those costing many times more!  Shipping and receipt of this order was handle in an expedient fashion.
$review_summary.: Quality cable.

$review_text.: I bought a set of three because I was excited by the low-low price. I'm not too finicky about my headphone sound, so I'm always looking for cheap ones. I do this because I'll commonly misplace a set after a month or so, meaning $40 earbuds are completely out of the question. But even with my low standards, these are a "never purchase" in my book.Really terrible construction on these means the plastic casing on the ear bud will fall apart after about a week of casual use. I thought it was strange when it happened to my first pair, annoying when it happened to the second, and horrible when it happened to the third. On top of that, the electronic receivers are the worst I've ever experienced with a headset. I felt like I was listening to all my favorite bands playing underwater. Too much mid, no high, and the bass was lacking any clarity. As I mentioned before, I'm no audiophile...but these things would make kindergartners cringe.Recap: They WILL snap apart (use electric tape for a bit, but it'll drive you crazy) and the audio is as bad as it gets.

$review_text.: I got this for my Nikon d3200

When I opened the box and goet it out I can see myself losing this

It is extremely light
I wanted to see if it worked with my camera instantly so upon trying I was noticing that it was not working

I then went in and changed how long my camera was going to wait for a responce from the remote
I found that I just needed a longer responce time
After fixing that it worked great.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this to connect a Dell 2407 WFP to my girlfriend's 27" iMac 11,3 (mini DisplayPort, no Thunderbolt.)  It's well built and works perfectly.  I'd even go so far as to suggest that it MAY be from the same manufacturer as the "genuine" Apple part.  Whether it actually is or isn't doesn't really matter, though.  If you need one, don't hesitate to save some money and get this one.  The one drawback may be the shipping time.  Mine took a couple weeks to arrive from China.(Edited to clarify specific iMac model.)

It recognized my photos and the few times I used all pictures were found and imported. I find most of these types of products never work and are a waste of time. The only negative I would bring up is maybe that the cord is short and does not seem all that stable as far as the joint where it meets the unit. Only time will tell

$review_text.: I have never owned a GPS device.  I've always wanted one.  In fact, my sister-in-law who gave it to me was surprised that gadget girl that I am, I don't own a GPS device.Now, I don't normally comment on packaging, but the one I got had the most horrible clamshell packaging I've ever encountered.  It was double-clam shelled.  And the outer clamshell was made of extra hard plastic.  It was nearly impossible to penetrate.  I finally got out my heavy duty box cutter, but I was afraid of nicking the device with my clunky knife.  It was not an easy job.Now, onto the device.  TomTom One 125 is a nice introduction to the GPS world.  It worked right out of the package.  I didn't need to plug it in to charge first.  The maps that I needed were already included.I got to choose the color scheme, the language and the voice.  What a nice selection of voices.  I chose a soothing female voice to help me find my way.  The map can be 2-D or 3-D.  I found 3-D to be much easier to follow.There is so much TomTom can do.  I can program my home address into the system and always have it take me home without reentering my address.  I can choose previously entered addresses from a menu.  I can add new addresses.  I can even look for a gas station or restaurant nearby.  As I drive, the symbols of upcoming points of interest pop up or I can hide them.I did have problems occasionally following the directions, especially if there are several intersections next to each other.  The voice will say "turn left" but I did not know exactly where to turn left.  Yes, I could check the map, but with the sun shining directly on it, I cannot see the map.  I think the more expensive units do read off the names of the streets, which I think I would like for my next upgrade.If I make a wrong turn, the TomTom will reroute me, sometimes making me do a big circle.  I wish it would just tell me I missed the turn and turn around.The TomTom does normally get me to my destination, sometimes showing me a better route than I would normally take, sometimes a more indirect or slower route.  Most of the time, it gets me there.  I've had one incident where the TomTom got me to my destination, but instead of telling me I was there, it wanted me to continue on and turn right.  I had another incident where I was told to bear left but I needed to stay to the right (I think my being in the carpool lane may have fooled it).  I'd say it is accurate more often than not and it will normally get most people to their destination eventually, at least in large metropolitan areas.  I'm not sure about rural areas; but if we use it in more rural areas, I will come back to update.I like that TomTom  has time displayed and estimated time of arrival, which adjusts depending on my speed.  It also flashes my speed, which turns red, if it thinks I'm speeding.  If the sunlight isn't impairing my view of the screen, I can see how far it is until my next turn.  The voice will help me get to the proper lane before a turn, and if there is a turn immediately after the next turn, it will say so.The unit is pocket size.  I can take it with me on walks and it will map walking routes, as well as driving routes.I'm glad I got a TomTom.  It's a basic unit, but it does the job nicely._______________________UPDATE:  Now that I've had this unit for some time, I've decided to upgrade.What  do I feel I'm missing in the TomTom ONE?  First and foremost, the spoken street names.  In this most basic model, the street names are not spoken.  We are only told to "turn right."  If there are several rights near each other, I end up missing the turn or turning on the wrong street.  It's not always easy to see the turn on the screen (the sun shines on it at certain angles and washes it out).  Spoken street names are a must in my upgrade.Next, I would like traffic and updated maps.  Where I'm living, traffic can be a nightmare, so the ability to route around it would be helpful.  New streets are always being added and I've been misguided by TomTom ONE on a few occasions by outdated maps.My choice isTomTom XL 340TM (Lifetime Traffic & Maps Edition) 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator.  I will post a review for that as soon as I can.

$REVIEW.: I gave these a 3 star rating but only because of the low price, otherwise a 1 or 2.Pros:Lightweight (but what headphones in this class aren't?)Cheap ( but what &#34; ... )Top band and slider rails appear to be made of HDPE plastic which is more flexible, won't become as brittle over time to reduce # of areas likely to break, and yet the top band would be even more durable made of spring metal and then it could hold an adjustment for optimal tension to suit your head sizeFair amount of bass for the cup size and price, not especially boomy, not out of control bass trying to make up for the shortcomings of a small driver and thin/light low volume plastic cupsFair cord length for portable use, ought to be 1' shorter for that but the extra 1' might help if your source is in a bag rather than a pocket nearer your head.90' plug doesn't stick up as far on portable players so they seem less bulky and there's less stress to the headphone jackFairly conservative design, no silly colors or shapes for niche artistic styling that not everyone would like, rather than the purpose of headphones.  They don't look &#34;as&#34; cheap as some in the same price class.Foam cushions are a little higher density than some, letting them sit closer to your ears.You won't care much if you break them or if they are stolen, except then you have no cans till you find a replacement.Cons:Lightweight - They have that empty tin can sound accentuating upper midrange, and they could have put a bit more plastic into the pieces that hold the cups only the adjustment sliders for more durabilityNo strain relief on the wires where they exit the cups.  If you coil your cord up for storage during portable use, you will find this to be one of the early failure modes.Clunky size adjustment, the notches in the HDPE rails are large and HDPE doesn't mold into distinct notches as well as other plasticsPre-molded angle on cups seems a little large compared to many cans, if your ears don't stick out a lot you may find they don't sit as flush against your ears as many cans despite the slight amount of swivel present, which results in loss of hearing much of the lower midrange and bassWhile the bass is fairly controlled for this price,  their marketing dept. fails with the feature &#34;XBS port&#34; because the bass is fairly poor relative to almost any (even slightly) larger cupped cans.  Small, light and portable is good but if you can accept an ounce of weight and a few millimeters size increase there are huge bass improvements to be had on cans with only slightly larger cups, and yet the price on those goes up some too.Although they are inexpensive, it would only cost a few cents more to make them more durable and improve the sound quality.  This seems like a false economy to me, my body and gear weigh dozens of pounds so why is shaving fractions of an ounce off their weight so important?  It isn't, this is just about saving a few cents in manufacturing cost at the expense of the aforementioned details.Overall:It's tempting to pick a product based on the lower price, but often you only get what you pay for.  Yes you could pay the same for inferior cans but don't let some of the more positive reviews fool you, these don't sound good at all relative to cans costly only a few dollar more.  They sound only slightly better than any $2 generic cans you can find anywhere.Despite all the pros I listed, they just don't meet the core purpose of providing good audio.  It is distracting how terrible they sound.  To be fair I would write the same about any $5 cans I've ever heard but on most I didn't see so many positive reviews that misled me into hoping these were different when they aren't.For a reference point, many consider me an audiophile.  My standards seem to be higher than average, but I'm not an elite snob about certain makes and models.  I've owned many a pair of cans and build some of my own audio gear and modify the rest.  Even so I am not trying to compare these against $40 cans, let alone more costly pairs.  They just don't sound good enough to use even if they were free, unless you're only listening to audible books or similar voice.  I would have returned them except that they are so inexpensive that it wasn't worth the bother.

$REVIEW.: The TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 wireless router operates at 300Mbps on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands at the same time, giving the user a total bandwidth of 600Mbps. This is useful when there are many users sharing the default 2.4 GHz frequency.The built-in USB port allows the connection of USB hard drives and printers that can then be shared wirelessly among users.There is a dedicated on-off switch for Wi-Fi. This is a convenient feature for parents who may find it necessary to regulate kids' electronic gadget-use time. In addition, there is Live Parental Controls which allow parents to fine-tune access policy, including IP-based bandwidth control.TP-LINK router has a default wireless password that prevents unauthorized access. I'd suggest changing the SSID to something that won't indicate the brand/model of your router. WPA encryption is much safer than WEP, so that is the type that you should choose.

$REVIEW.: Mine wasn't  a gift, but from what I've seen most people stick with the stock keyboards obviously not realizing what they are missing. Not having learned conventional typing, a split keyboard would have been a problem for me. The wave style of  this keyboard is so forgiving of my incorrect typing technique, it feels like I must be typing correctly. All the shortcut keys around the keyboard make sense and are useful, some are programmable. The mouse center-wheel  can be moved to the side for side-scroll and there are a couple of buttons on the side of the mouse that are good as replacements for the browser back and forward buttons. The keyboard is extremely comfortable with a part to rest the heals of your hands on. And it's wireless too, with both the keyboard and mouse only using one USB port. Setup was easy, a little time-consuming with all the customization, but well-worth the effort.

$REVIEW.: I've had several types of cases for my K2, eventually deciding I didn't like any enough to keep one on it. When I ordered my Fire I opted to try again... after reading reviews and comparing prices this looked like the best case for the money.I am SOOO happy I took a chance on it, I love the brown and it works so perfectly. I questioned if it would be strong enough to keep the fire upright during use (ie not just for watching a show or movie but for actual typing or game playing etc) It holds it up perfectly, I have no issues using my finger or a stylus and keeping it upright. It's even sturdy enough to balance on my lap in bed!I've only had the case for about a week so I can't speak for how it will function long term but it seems solidly made and high quality, I'm honestly shocked at the low price and highly recommend trying it for your Fire too!

$REVIEW.: The MinoHD is absolutely AMAZING and it is a great gift for the holidays.PHYSICAL FEATURES--PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY--For such a small camcorder, I have to say that the quality of the MinoHD--both in filming and in playback-- is impeccable. It films better than any other camcorder that I have and it captures sound very well. Upon playback, video is crystal-clear and sound is crisp. I took my camcorder to the beach and it captures all sounds--the seagulls, the wind, the waves, everything. Don't underestimate this product due to its size--it's great!--DESIGN--The design is both aesthetically and ergonomically appealing--the camcorder is very sleek and looks shiny and polished. My friends keep asking me, "What is that? That's so cool." (Yeah, it is pretty cool!). It is also designed to grip easily in your hands so it's really easy and comfortable to use.--SIZE--The MinoHD fits RIGHT IN MY POCKET and could easily fit in a purse, wherever you want to bring it. Who would have thought that you could find an HD CAMCORDER THAT WAS PORTABLE?? It's so much easier to carry this around than a bulky camcorder or camera.--FUNCTION--The MinoHD is really easy to use. There are only a few buttons on the MinoHD, which takes a lot of the hassle and confusion of trying to figure out how to start filming. The screen is bright and easy to read. The camera has a zoom that works while you're filming. It stores 60 minutes of video--which is a lot for a little device like this. It charges through the USB port of your computer.--COMPATIBILITY--The flip-out USB extends after pressing a button on the side and my Mac instantly identifies the camcorder once I plug in the USB.This is a great product for everyone--I love my MinoHD Camcorder!

But when my last antenna broke which cost a lot more than this one, I was ready to send it back if it didn't perform

I'm aware that manufacturers suggest placing your receiver antenna high up (near the ceiling) for best reception, but come on, I'm not going to place my tower on top of a bookshelf
So while keeping my two different computers on the floor and buying this AMPED WIRELESS HIGH POWER BOOSTER and placing it about 4 feet off the floor the reception was great for all the computers in the house! No up and downs in signal power, or good and bad days
Always a good strong signal.

$REVIEW.: As far as stereo receivers go, the Sherwood RX-4109 is good value for the money and should definitely be on your short list of receivers to seriously consider.Audio output quality is probably the most important consideration, and the RX-4109 does not disappoint. I've found the audio output to be clear and undistorted even at high volumes. I'd even go so far as to say that the output also has a certain "warmth" to it. I've compared it to the Sony STR-DH100 as well as the Teac AG-790A. What I find is that I prefer the sound of the Sherwood every time.The built in tuner does a good job on AM and FM reception, even if you use only the included wire antennas.If you want lots of bass, you probably won't be happy with this receiver. Even with the bass setting turned all the way up, this thing doesn't put out a lot of bass. This is true even if you have big speakers.The controls on the receiver itself and the remote are easy to use and clearly labeled. Although there are more buttons on the remote than the receiver, it's still a relatively clean and easy to use layout. Most everything you need to do can be done directly from the unit's front panel, so you don't have to reach for the remote all the time.A turntable input suitable for use with magnetic cartridge turntables rounds out the feature set nicely. If you have records you wish to listen to, this receiver is one of the few choices you have for a unit with a built in turntable preamplifier and equalization circuit. This input is slightly noisy (turn up the volume to a high level without a record playing and you'll hear a little white noise), although not so much that it seems to interfere with record playback. All other inputs are extremely quiet and feature gold plated connectors.There are really only two drawbacks--first, the speaker requirements as put forth by Sherwood are somewhat restrictive. If you use one set of speakers, it is recommended that they be eight ohm units. Because this receiver puts the speakers in a parallel circuit--which reduces their electrical resistance--those who use more than one set of speakers at once are directed to connect sixteen ohm speakers. I have run two sets of eight ohm speakers (for an effective resistance of four ohms) without issue, but some have reported shutdowns at high volumes in this configuration. Those who use two pairs of four ohm speakers will be taking a real chance, as the amplifier will only see a two ohm load. The heatsink that serves to cool the power transistors is smaller than it should be, and this too could cause problems.The second drawback is more of a 'wish it had this feature' sort of thing. Although there are provisions in the unit to do so, this receiver's tuner does not decode and display RDS information (US models only--European models seemingly do decode RDS). RDS isn't used terribly often in the US, but it would still be nice to have access to this information when a station is broadcasting it. Yet none of the major receiver manufacturers--including Sherwood--offer this on US-market stereo receiver products.

$review_text.: This product is designed for a 13.3" Macbook, but I selected it because I have both a 13.3" MacBook and a Sony Vaio laptop (SR series) and thought it might work for both of them.  Turns out it did.  The Sony fits perfectly (12.4" width)!I carry my laptop around quite a bit and I find that this case provides a good protection - good thickness but doesn't take too much space in the bag.  I have actually been shopping for a case for quite a while but found the price point often too high and the material too flimsy - not with this case.  The price point of $24.99 seems reasonable.  Also, the color selection offered is great as well - I received the Moka one, and really like the design, look and feel.The item arrived in a ziploc-like bag, sealed, and with a little color swap on the outside so if you were buying this in a brick and mortar store, it would help you see the true color and texture.Overall, I'd recommend this case to anyone looking for some protection for their 12 or 13 inch laptop.

$REVIEW.: So it was a little confusing getting this one going for me.  I wanted to hook up two monitors (DVI and DVI&#62;VGA) and a TV via HDMI.  In order to do so I had to get a DisplayPort to HDMI Male to Female Adapter (Link at bottom).  After that it worked just fine it was just a little confusing at first because they don't really tell you that anywhere.  You would think if you have 4 plugs on the back of your card you would be able to use them all. All in all it wasn't a big deal though!  Also remember to be sure your PSU has a 6 pin PCIe power plug.Heres the adapter others may work but this was the cheapest I found on amazon.  If you pick a different one make sure it is ACTIVE HDMI.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EDT0072/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7

$review_text.: My previous laptop was by no means a slow laptop. It was a Dell 17" with an i7-920 processor, Radeon HD4650 video card and 4GB of DDR3 RAM.This laptop blows it out of the water. Now I do have to stress that I replaced the included HDD withSeagate Momentus XT 750 GB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST750LX003since having a 5200 RPM HDD paired up with all the other excellent hardware in this laptop seemed like a crime. I never even powered on the laptop with the included HDD.You can even take the included HDD and buy an external enclosure for it (such asVantec NexStar TX 2.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 External Hard Drive Enclosure) and for $130 you have yourself a SSD-HDD Hybrid drive inside your laptop and a sleek 750GB external HDD.Back to the laptop, this thing is incredibly fast. Boots up in about 30 seconds (as in you press the power button and you're on your desktop in 30 seconds), runs games like Starcraft II on High with little to no stuttering and handles CPU intensive tasks with no problem.The backlit keyboard is also a major plus.If I had to list a negative it would be the lengthy amount of time it takes to start up the WiFi radio. When it turns on it takes around 1 minute to actually turn on the radio and connect to my WiFi. (It's not my router since all the other devices I have do not take as long.) However this is nowhere near a deal-breaker.For $670 this laptop is a steal. Add in $130 for the Hybrid drive and even at $800 this laptop is a steal. Puts some other so-called "Gaming laptops" priced at $1200+ to shame.Edit:I didn't even mention that the laptop speakers are pretty great. The best speakers I've heard (from a laptop). The included subwoofer does help a bit, but don't expect Theater quality sound. They're better than any other laptop I've heard, but they're still two tiny speakers with a tiny subwoofer crammed into a laptop. They're great for general purposes (ie. Gaming) but not so great if you are an audiophile.

There are a number of media center remotes to help accomplish this task, but they all seem to have some limitations, in addition to the frustration of setting them up.  And most "wireless desktops" require you to use the arm of your lounge chair as the "desk" for the wireless mouse.This is where the DiNovo Edge comes in.  Combining a sleek keyboard with an integrated touchpad that lends a touch of style to your HTPC.  The unit is bluetooth for good range, rechargeable for the environment, and dead sexy to boot!  This is probably the best wireless keyboard I've used in my media center, combining the responsiveness of a Logitech keyboard with an accurate optical touchpad.  Battery life thus far has performed as advertised.  Overall, if you can justify spending this kind of money on a keyboard/touchpad, I don't think you will be disappointed.

$review_text.: This is a awesome Streamer/Bluray/DVD player. I haven't experienced any issues whatsoever playing back Bluray disks. Boot times are very good with the disks I tested. Everything played back perfectly with stunning picture quality. However, I really purchased this player for its streaming abilities. Sony players were dinged in the past for a poor Netflix experience. Sony have fixed this with a updated Netflix interface that supports 1080p and Dolby Digital+ streams. Similarly Amazon VOD supports Dolby Digital bitstream audio, and VUDU and HULU+ are unchanged from the 2011 players, but work fine. Its also nice to have "crackle" on there so you can watch the odd Seinfeld episode when you fancy.I also tested the player with a DNLA server. Sony seem to recommend Serviio (free) so I think they must test the DLNA features of the player with this software. I tested photos, music and video and everything played back perfectly.Anyway, a great streamer/disk player. Highly recommended !!** update **Had a need to play a Disney BD disk on this player the other day. A comment here suggests that Disney BDs won't play. Complete nonsense. They playback perfectly.** Update (8/27/12) **Sony added support for watch lists with the amazon Vod app.Cinema NOW is now supported.

$review_text.: Now don't get me wrong, I love this remote, but it has one glaring drawback. In order to use the programming software for it, you have to be connected to the internet. Even if you only want to change one setting, you still must be connected. I suppose if you have a high speed connection, and aren't a conspiracy theorist who believes that the shadow government is keeping track of your every move through the internet, the always connected requirement isn't an issue. If you're like me, and have dial up, only one phone line, and are suspicious of what information corporations are collecting, having to be connected to fine tune your remote is a huge PITA. Seriously, it would be easy enough to connect once when you need to download the remote libraries, and be done with it.Now for the good point. You only need to tell the software what equipment you have, and how it's connected, then it's one button operation. If I'm watching a DVD, and want to switch to the TIVO, with one button, it turns off the stereo and DVD player, then switches the TV to the correct input. The best part of this is you don't have to teach a guest how to operate your entertainment center!

$REVIEW.: Many photographers who purchase telephoto lenses wind up disappointed in their lenses' performance; they achieve subpar results and then swear that the lens is "not sharp."  Some lenses indeed might not be optically outstanding, but even in these cases the major cause of soft images, particularly when camera and lens are handheld, is camera/lens shake.  People routinely try to take highly magnified photos at shutter speeds that are simply too slow.Nikon has come up with a (partial) solution to this problem through its innovative "vibration reduction" series of lenses.  These optics are designed to compensate, at least partially, for the camera shake/movement that is inevitable when a lens is hand-held.  According to Nikon, the VR mechanism adds two or more "stops" worth of steadiness, meaning that a 400mm. lens that previously might be adequately handheld at 1/500 second now will (often) produce good results at 1/125.  Out in the field this can make the difference between a successful photo outing and a frustrating one.Does this technology work, and is this 80-400mm. lens a good product overall?  To both questions I offer a qualified "yes."  As long as one realizes that VR is not magic and has definite limitations, this feature is definitely worth paying some extra money for, particularly if one's photographic style prevents the regular and disciplined use of a tripod. The other thing about VR to keep in mind is that since camera shake itself is variable, it's a good idea always to take multiple photos to ensure that at least one of them is optimally sharp (a slow-mo record of how much one 'vibrates' while holding a camera would reveal that from instant to instant there is considerable variation).But what about this lens' performance overall?  There definitely are some drawbacks and compromises of which potential buyers should be aware. The lens is fairly heavy, and since it utilizes what is now an "old-fashioned" screw-drive AF mechanism, autofocus can seem very slow and noisy. It would be nice if someday Nikon replaced this version of the lens with an AF-S model, but there apparently is no current plan to do this.  To minimize the maddeningly slow "searching" that a slow AF lens can exhibit, Nikon has included a "focus limit" switch.  This makes it possible to cut the focus range in half, essentially.  If one is taking pictures that are all at a distance or are all reasonably close-up, setting the switch to "limit" will restrict the lens' focusing range, allowing proper focus to be achieved more quickly.Another drawback is that the removable tripod mount that comes with the lens is simply not very good. Photographers intending to use the lens on a tripod regularly are advised to purchase a third party mount such as that offered by Kirk Enterprises.Optically, the lens is actually quite remarkable.  This is a 5:1 tele zoom, and one would think that given the "jack of all trades" nature of such a beast there would be severe optical compromises.  Not so.  As with just about all lenses, there is a slight loss of sharpness at full aperture, but once the lens is stopped down even one stop, sharpness at all focal lengths is quite satisfactory.  As a bird photographer, I use my lens mainly at 400mm.  As compared to my older, manual focus 400mm. Nikkors, the 80-400mm. is not quite as sharp and contrasty, but in practical terms the differences are truly minimal.  This lens produces fine images exhibiting good contrast and excellent color rendition.  Optically, it's a winner.One caveat: because this is a complex zoom built from a large number of optical elements, it does NOT perform particularly well with teleconverters.  With certain 1.4x teleconverters such as those in the Kenko Teleplus Pro line, the lens actually will still autofocus (even more slowly, however) and the VR mechanism works, sort of.  But there is a notable deterioration of sharpness.  With a 2x teleconverter, there is no AF, no VR, and even further reduced sharpness.  If working with teleconverters is something you are counting on, stick to a single focal length tele.Overall, however, for photographers bent on getting sharp photos at longer focal lengths hand-held, this is a fine lens to try and buy.  For walkaround bird photographers like myself, it's nearly ideal.  It's very likely that in a few years this early version of a VR lens will seem antiquated and quaint.  For now, however, it represents a very good investment for Nikon users.
$SUMMARY.: Terrific but pricey hand-holdable tele zoom

$REVIEW.: They were sending out the OM system adapter (so you can use your existing OM lenses with this camera) since the release of the digital system, upon request (for free). After waiting a week for mine they called and left a message that said this adapter isn't available and will not be made any more. They said I would have to find a (non-existant as far as I know) 3rd party adapter to do the job. So I am just out of luck.The customer service is extremely disappointing. I choose this camera because of this OM compatibility, since I have cameras, lenses, and accessories that I acquired over the past 30 years for that system. If I wanted to start over I would probably go with the Canon, since they have a longer track record on AF and digital cameras, plenty of available used equipment, and more 3rd party support.The camera itself is nice if you don't care about the lens compatibility. I have not compared it to Canon or Nikon so I can't say which is better... but the design of the Olympus is very good. You can easily control exposure and the like without using menus at all.I would give the camera itself 5 stars and the company 0 stars for boneheaded decisions that are not in their best interest.

$REVIEW.: I've owned this tablet for about 4 months now, and I believe I have a good grasp of it. Out of the box, you get the tablet, an AC charger, and a micro USB cable. The AC charger is superior to the Nexus 7 2012 charger, because it is smaller, square, and doesn't fall off the wall charger like it'd predecessor. The micro USB cable is the same as the Nexus 2012 charger, which are light and sleek, but my micro USB connector has popped out of the plastic a few times, which is an easy fix to snap back in, but is tedious when it happens.Hardware:The tablet itself is very light, which is nice if you want to hold it in one hand, but it is large enough to play android games comfortably. When the Tablet originally came out, people were having touch troubles with the screen, but that has since been resolved, and there hasn't been any major issues. This tablet is 7 inches, which is big enough to not strain your eyes when looking at the screen, but small enough to fit snugly in my pockets. The screen of the tablet is an 1900x1200 IPS display, which means that it can go anywhere with sunlight and still be clearly seen, and to see the smallest of details that most tablets for this price skimp. This is great for reading books or playing games outside. There are three hard buttons on the right side of the tablet: Power, Up and Down, and three soft buttons: Back, Home, and Multitask. This device has 2gb of Ram and a snapdragon S4 1.5ghz processor which makes multitasking very easy, and apps smooth. This Nexus has a front and rear (5MP) camera which is a great improvement over its predecessor. The stereo speakers allow you to hear clearly when playing music or videos without needing headphones. Hardware wise, this tablet is great, light, and powerful.Update 1/22/14:People that has reviewed this product has said that the fact that no micro sd card slot was a major negative. Although this is correct, you can add an OTG (On the Go) cable to this tablet and it will work fine. From there, you have to decide if you want to root your tablet or not.My recommendation for which one to buy is from Meenova (not sold on amazon). They sell a "Mini MicroSD Card Reader" which is used on my Nexus 7. Unfortunately, they do not have a store on Amazon yet, so you'll have to Google it.I am not affiliated any way with the above people, but I will definitely say that my 64gb micro SDHC card works great with Poweramp, and every emulator I've used.Software:This tablet is backed by Google Play, which is a great platform for free apps, and the paid apps are great. If you can think of an app, Google play probably has a free version with ads, great for students like myself trying to use a tablet on a budget.Overall:I use this tablet every single day. As a music player, a grocery list, a game console. I take it wherever I go, and I'd probably be lost without it. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who is interested in a tablet, especially at its price point @ $269 when I bought it, and deals are constantly online for much less.Pros:+ Price is great compared to similar tablets.+ Screen size is large but portable+ 1900x 1200 IPS screen enables to see tablet wherever you are without seeing pixels+ 2gb Ram and Snapdragon S4 processor for easy multitasking+ Backed by Google Play's market.+ Front and Rear camerasCons:- Charger cord's connector sometimes comes loose, requires plastic to be reattached.

$REVIEW.: Every photographer needs something like this for portrait work and for indoor shooting in general. For the price, this Neewer item is amazing! I have no idea about durability, but I am impressed so far with the construction, the quality of the reflecting material and the case, and the small size it twists into for storage and transport. The design is very clever and well worth the $$ even if it only lasts a few shoots. It needs to be opened up for a week or so... or steamed to get the worse wrinkles out, but even these do not hinder the excellent reflective surfaces. It also works as a great "white card" for setting white balance. HIGHLY recommended.

$REVIEW.: I have had this device for about one year now and i have been using it with my 4th generation 20gb iPod. The best features are that it integrates neatly into the top of my iPod and that i don't have to buy batteries for it (it uses the iPods battery). Griffin claim that it doesn't decrease the battery charge of the iPod but i can honestly say that i can get about 3 hours of non stop play on a full charge. Without the iTrip i can get 6 hours of play. Im going to buy an iPod car charger when the price comes down.The sound quality is not that great, its basically just like listening to the ordinary radio stations. I think the most difficult part of using this device, is trying to find a radio frequency that isnt used by a major radio station (it sounds easy but it takes a while even if you live in a rural area). Just like everyone else says here, i find the tuning procedure really clunky.At least im happy i can play my music in the car without earphones.

 It was that easy

 Then I started looking at the many, many features this camera has
 I was blown away


 The first time user can use it just by turning it on and pointing and shooting


 The experienced user can set shutter speeds, f-stops, do panoramic pictures, and many, many more things
 The battery life is amazing


 I have used other digital cameras, but this is the best I've ever seen or used
 The fact that it has 6 MP is just awesome
 When I plugged the camera into my 32 inch TV, I saw no pixels at all
 The 6x optical zoom is also wonderful

 I attended a community event with lots of children, and I was able to zoom in on children clear across the park and still get good close-up photos

$review_text.: Seven years ago, I bought my first Sony universal remote control RM-VL600. It was a nice powerful remote, but lost its look in just a few months. Last week I finally got rid of it, and bought this new one. This one is much more comfortable and well balanced in hand. They have really put some thought into the design of this remote. There is even a thin soft plastic line infused around the edges which helps on grabbing the remote and hold it firmly in hand without worrying about accidental slips or drops.I only have one problem with this remote. I have yet to find a way to learn the menu key of my Comcast xFinity Cisco box. No matter how hard I try, it doesn't learn that specific key, and needless to say there is no predefined code for this device. However, I have had enough universal remotes over the years to understand that some IR sequences are not learnable. Another issue that you may have is that it doesn't have a backlit. It didn't bother me, but based on your preferences, it may be a deal breaker.I think this remote is a big step up from VL600. It is easy to hold, and feels comfy in hands. If you don't mind the lack of backlit nor the rare occasion of the remote not being able to learn special keys, then this will make a nice addition to your setup.
$SUMMARY.: Powerful, long range, easy to hold.

I ordered 2 and did not get the gray colored one like in the picture which I wanted so it'd be easily found among all the black wires I got black ones instead, but they work and that's all that counts I'm very happy.

$REVIEW.: ThisAmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hubis a solid little gem for those who frequently have to pack and go in a flash. I needed USB expansion for my13-inch Apple MacBook Pro, as it is limited in its native state to only two USB 2.0 ports. Had been caught in the field without my regular USB hub recently due to rushing and packing too fast, but when I saw this one here, with all of the positive reviews, just had to grab it.Likes:+ Unpowered four-port hub; works on PCs and Macs alike+ Convenient; three USB ports in front, one in back+ Ample cord length, about 10- inches (27cm)+ Extra-bright orange LED; easy to see that the hub is functional+ Compact flat design; fits in notebook bags easily+ Easy to open recyclable cardboard box+ Excellent priceDislikes:- None so farIn Use:Should note that my needs for a USB hub are simple. I play no games nor do I connect any high-end audio devices to my computer. But my hub needs to be able to reliably connect to and back up date on my 500GB external hard drive, and this is essential. It also has to charge and back up my BlackBerry Curve. Further, it has to be capable of being used with either my MacBook Pro or my Windows 7 notebook. This small hub has met all of those needs without any problems.The older USB 2.0 hub that I had purchased as part of aTargus Wired Laser Pack Notebook Bundlein 2008 works just fine, but the LED had been intermittent. Had been thinking of getting another portable USB hub, so this new one will serve the purpose quite well and still allow me to keep the older one in the notebook case for emergency use.Must admit that the Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging is a plus point, as I'm tired of messing with opening clamshell packaging. It's recyclable, but is can also be repurposed; right now it's holding a bunch of rubber bands that were cluttering my workspace.If you need extra USB expansion, theAmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hubis hard to beat.8/13/2012

$REVIEW.: This remote is perfect for the price. I bought this for my son's play room and it has already seen some abuse and a few drops. It is a simple, yet very durable remote. It was as easy to program as any basic universal remote. It works great with an old no-name DVD player as well as my Vizio HD TV. The menu function is a bit quirky, in that you have to choose menu to activate the 4 way direction arrow, then deselect menu to return to the volume/channel functions. But I won't ding it for that, because, for the price, this is a 5 star remote all around.

$REVIEW.: When Time Warner Cable announced they were upping their equipment rental fees, I immediately started searching for a compatible replacement
 I wanted a combination wireless router and cable modem because it's simply easier to deal with a single piece of equipment
 The Zoom was decently well reviewed, as well as priced right, so I decided to give it a try.I've been very happy with this purchase over the last 6 months or so


 My connection is excellent and fairly stable


 About once a week I will have to restart the modem to reestablish a connection, but I have had that problem with every device I've ever used with Time Warner.The administrative menus for the Zoom are well laid out and full featured


 You can manipulate just about every aspect of your connection

 Port forwarding is easy to set up, as are static IP addresses
 It is a simple matter to switch your wireless channel, and the UI page will actually tell you if a particular channel is experiencing lots of interference.Overall this is a good device for a good price, it does its job and it actually looks really good sitting on a shelf, no ugly electronics here

 A solid buy.

$REVIEW.: Compared with the flimsy flip-face that comes with the m500 systems, this is beautiful, but overkill.The zippered leather case is well-padded and protects the m500/505 well. With a little creative positioning you can still get the m500/505 into its cradle without having to remove it from the case's compartment (a real time-saver). However, the multiple pockets for the expansion cards are somewhat useless (how many m500-series owners do you know with SD cards coming out their ears? I'm a geek and I only own the one I bought with the system!), and as a wallet there's not enough pockets here to move stuff over from your pocketbook.This is a nice case, but it's not perfect either. Get rid of the pockets, and keep the padding, and drop the price. Still, if you want to protect your investment in your m500/5 Palm, don't trust that flimsy flip face: *this* is a much better idea.

$REVIEW.: This enclosure works very well.  I used it to repurpose a Hitatchi TravelStar 120GB drive from a dead Gateway notebook to portable use for my MacBook Air.  Others have reviewed this product so I won't repeat everything.*  The enclosure is very sturdy.  I don't quite agree that it will not suitably protect a 2.5" hard drive.  It's not military hardened, but it is very strong and will protect a drive for all but the most rough (mis)use.*  Yes, the screws are small.  But that's just the nature of small devices and the gauge of the mounting holes on 2.5" ATA/IDE drives.  Use a #0 Phillips screwdriver; using a smaller size will make it more difficult to work with the screws.  I use a tray when working with small parts.  This saves grief and blue air when (not if) I drop a screw or small part.*  The alignment of the holes did not *precisely* match the drive, but who knows whether the misalignment is due to the case or the drive.  Taking things slowly and carefully, I was able to secure the drive without much difficulty.  (One reviewer commented in this regard that he thought snaps or clips would be better.  I disagree, as those would be too prone to failure.)*  The supplied cables are of at least good quality, and long enough without being too long.As for the "issue" of the power cable ... as someone else stated in a reply, the need for a separate power cable is dependent on the device (laptop, hub, etc.,) to which the drive is connected.  A cheap notebook or unpowered hub may not supply enough juice to properly run this drive.  The fact that Macally supplied the power port and cable at this price is a BENEFIT.  If you don't need it, all the better; but at least it's there and you can't complain about it not being included.  :)

Having a few extra modular ports is a nice addition especially if you ever plan on running any of the newer video cards that use 2x 6 pin pcie plugs. Runs nice and cool.This is a big psu, and wasn't intended for anything other than the Twelve Hundred, cp 183 and 193. Other cases will more than likely need to be modified to fit this beast. But what a beast it is. Power wise, the psu can handle just about any single video card. In SLI if you're looking for more than dual GeForce GTX 260's you may want to consider a bigger box, like the CP-1000Cp-1000 840W Power Supply Atx12 F/ Antec Cases Nvidia Sli Ready. Or any other 1000watt psu for that matter.

$review_text.: I purchased a Creative Zen 16 GB model and couldn't be more pleased with it.  I primarily use it to store content from Amazon Unboxed and Real Rhapsody and find that it is more than adequate to hold my movies, television shows and music. The Creative Zen is simple and intuitive to use and has great resolution and sound quality.  It's small size makes it a great traveling companion and the ideal player for cross-country airplane flights.  I've watched several movies on the player and find the experience as satisfying as watching from my big-screen at home.  Video quality is fantastic!  I won't be carrying my laptop for travel entertainment anymore.  I slip the Zen in a shirt pocket and I'm ready to go.

$REVIEW.: I love Macs, but must say that I ordered this through Amazon to replace another brand.  Though these have had no issues for other people I know, I spilled some water on it and it died.  I even removed every key, cleaned it and let it dry, no luck.  I use a wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard now....I love them.

$review_text.: Happy with my purchase and worth the price. Would recommend to others. A few notes since nobody else has reviewed this yet.Video & audio quality are as expected and very good.Wireless feature is not usable for me.  I have my wireless network locked down in part by MAC address (if you don't know what that means, you can safely ignore this part of the review).  Unfortunately, the camera does not tell you what its MAC address is, and it isn't located anywhere on the body. The manual is likewise missing any information on this. And for those of you who say I can just have my router scan my network for it, I live in a townhouse community with like 100 other wireless devices all showing up on scans.Built-in 8gb of storage is great, but you'll still need to get a memory card if you are going to use this thing for real. I picked up a SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 30MB/s (SDSDU-064G-U46) and it works fine with no issues.Stock battery sticks out the back some since the camera was shrunk down to be small.  I'm fine with it, wife hates it. If you choose to upgrade to a bigger battery, this will be even more pronounced.  If you plan on recording more than 90 minutes or so, you'll need a bigger battery.Touchscreen isn't like your iPad - you've gotta press a fair amount to get it to register what you're doing. I find myself having to put my free fingers behind the panel to help hold it since I have to push so much.  I've gotten more familiar with this over the past week or two, but I still like to hold the touchscreen.  Also, touchscreen isn't the most accurate. I don't have chubby fingers, but it doesn't always click where I want it to. Again, I've gotten better with practice at clicking where I want, but it still sometimes goes goofy.  I still prefer a joystick.Has a mini hot shoe.  Haven't used it yet, but be aware if you have full sized hot shoe accessories.Don't think my griping makes me regret my purchase. Like I said before, I'm happy with the purchase and would buy it again. Photo & video/audio quality are great.

$REVIEW.: Ive bought at least 4-5 HDMI to Thunderbolt cables off of Amazon in the last 2 years and its always the same. They work great for a few months and then the Audio starts to cut out and then the whole cable stops working. Well the last time I bought one I swore I wouldn't buy another so when It broke I started looking for alternatives. Thats when I came across this little guy. Ive had it for 6months at least and still works like a charm. Would defiantly recommend to anyone with a Mac. Like the title says it just works much better than the alternative.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for Pandora, Youtube, Netflix, etc. Other programs are nice bonus. However, when I first hooked it up most of those that I wanted did not show. After being hooked up a little bit, it did an update. The update brought Netflix, Youtube, etc. Pandora was one of the channels already loaded. Can open and close DVD from remote or player. The player is smaller then I expected in size, but that is nice and takes up less room.

$review_text.: Man... I can't wait for these little dudes to burn in, they sound pretty amazing right out of the box. I read countless reviews of various earbuds over the course of the last few weeks, and finally settled on this pair. I figure sound is subjective to the listener, as well as fit is to the shape of each individual's ear canal, so I threw most of the picky reviews right out the window. I know for sure, that if the tips are an improper fit, you will miss out on a lot of great sound.I love the fact that these come with 4 different size sets of of tips for different size ears, including a pair of really comfy memory foam tips that I enjoy right away.Clean treble, deep bass, great mids and clarity in tone and volume. First listen was, "A Day In The Life" off of The Beatles Sgt. Pepper... yeah - I'm going to enjoy these for a while! Can't beat the price, comfort and quality!

$review_text.: We purchased this Samsung for our bedroom and couldn't be happier. The picture is as good as it gets. We've been watching the Olympics for the past two weeks and we've been amazed by the quality of the video.We're also very pleased with the size of the screen. We're not into huge TVs that take up an entire room, we found 26 inches to be the perfect size. This is obviously a personal preference, but it works well for us.We have Verizon FIOS, and unlike our 22 inch Samsung, we've had no problems with the HDMI connector on this set with the connection to our Verizon Set Top Box.The audio is on par with other 26 inch LCD HD TVs. If you want surround sound, there are plenty of connectors so you can easily attach an inexpensive Samsung Home Theater [or any other brand] to the TV in only a few minutes.Overall, this TV is fantastic and we're so glad we decided on a Samsung. We bought it from Amazon at a very competitive price.

$REVIEW.: My previous router -- the Netgear R6300 -- had been the best router I ever had. But in recent weeks it started to get a bit glitchy. The wifi signal seemed to weaken a bit, and the network connection would fail with anything but a very strong signal. Devices 2 rooms away would drop their connections all the time.So after some searching, I found this ASUS router and ordered it. And I have absolutely no regrets. It was easy to set up, even in expert mode. It has all kinds of features, including guest wifi for both bands that can be included or excluded from your home network, and also a visitor wifi if you want to offer an open connection. You can set time limits for any of the SSIDs, so you can automatically boot people off after a given period of time, which might be helpful if you're offering wifi in a more public area.After a day of strong performance, I combined this router with the ASUS EA-N66 Repeater, and now the wifi in the house is strong everywhere. Oh, heaven is a stable internet connection!

$REVIEW.: Bought this new at Sam's.  I know they're getting close to end-of-life, but that's partly why I bought it--it was comparatively cheap.  I could have gotten the 1600 for the same price here at Amazon, but Best Buy just told me they've been discontinued, too.  So whatever.  I was just looking for a decent Blu-ray player that could stream Netflix.  And I got it.This is for my theater room.  Unlike most theater aficionados, I don't have much of a budget for my theater room.  It's 4 years in the making, and I'm still finishing up sheetrock--no carpet, no paint, etc.  Just the basics--a decent, albeit low-end audio system (Onkyo 7.1 something or other with a custom built sub), a 480p projector, and a couple of couches.  And now the Blu-ray, of course.I was hesitant to get the Blu-ray, because I don't have the cash for a HD projector, but as cheap as they are now and the promise of Netflix streaming were enough to tip the scales in its favor.  I was smart enough to add a network plug in my theater room when I wired it, so the lack of a wireless adapter was not a downside for me.  I am very happy with the Netflix playback.  I've only used it a few times still, but it's very quick (starts in under 30 seconds) and quality is very good (granted, it doesn't have to be superb to look as good as 480p is ever going to look).One thing that I really like about this projector is that it has the DTS master audio and the Dolby TrueHD decoders built-in.  If I read everything right, it means my Onkyo amp, which does not have these decoders, but which does support PCM mode for the full 7.1 channels, can still get the full-quality DTS HD or Dolby TrueHD soundtrack, thanks to the decoders on the Blu-ray player.  Haven't had a whole lot of time to mess with this yet, but I'm hoping I've understood that all correctly.I've only watched a couple DVDs and part of one Blu-ray on it so far.  It's as good as you could hope for.  The only complaint I have (and I'm really grasping here) is that there is a slight pause as it switches layers on the DVD.  But that's common to many DVD players out there.  Not a big surprise and not very disappointing.

$REVIEW.: This Kodak Digital Camera is Awesome !  The only problem with this camera is that it can't take a bad picture.  Do you remember Glamour Shots in the mall?  They could take a picture of a plain jane and make her look like a million dollar princess -- this camera does the same thing !  I swear I took a picture of a pile of trash and after Kodak adds it's little Color Science - it was the most prettiest trash pile I've seen in my life !This camera just ads a little sunshine to every picture through it's Color Science technology - no other camera on the market has that.  I bought a 2nd Digital Camera .. a Pentax Optio S and returned it back to the store because the pictures didn't even compare to Kodak's.I don't think I will ever find a Digital Camera that can take pictures like the Kodak. Oh and one more thing, this camera is smart enough to automatically adjust itself to achieve perfect lighting, balance, etc.Why somebody would want to &quot;fiddle&quot; with settings is beyond me.  By the time you did all that wouldn't you miss your Kodak moment?  Good Luck with your purchase - but you won't go wrong if you pick this one.

$review_text.: I've got 2 Pearstone LP-E8 replacements, besides the Canon original that came with the camera (T4i).I've used these Wasabi for a short time (less than 2 weeks), so I still can't comment on their duration or reliability (hence the 4 stars review), but they seem to work just fine

I still have to do some tests to see how they fare against the Pearstone, but since I've started using a grip recently, and my average use is for both video and pictures (sometimes I take more pics, sometimes I record more movies), I don't have a solid ground to say how much they last on a single charge.Anyway, this amazing pack with 2 batteries, a charger and even a car adapter is sold for less than a single Pearstone and just a bit more than a single Photive, so I think it's well worth it!In the future I may update this review to comment about reliability, but so far, no problems found!

$review_text.: [Later: I hate it when the price goes up after I've submitted a review admittedly including that consideration--especially since there are currently some $5-$6 "over-achievers" that also deserve the listener's consideration.  For every additional $5, these will necessarily lose a star.]Over the years I've evolved from merely being fastidious in my musical requirements to becoming somewhat of an audiophile, especially after discovering what some of these small in-ear transducers (IEM) headphones are capable of--namely, full-frequencied and accurate audio reproduction of bass, piano, the full drum kit (shimmering ride cymbal, tight snares, crisp "chic chic" of the high-hat).  I also look for detailed reproduction of piano touch, articulation of the strings on the bass (I want to hear fingers attack gut strings--flesh on flesh), the clarity and pitch-identifiability of the "walking" acoustic bass, the transient response of the piano's sounding board and the lingering effect of pedaled tones along with vibrant sympathetic pitches (the overtone series), the meshing of the singer's lips while delivering a tricky labial or nasal phoneme.  Finally, qualities such as "natural presence," an impressive sound-stage (I want to be able to place the instruments in the room, left to right as well as front to rear), and dyanmic scale (let me hear the momentary changes from ppp to fff during a Bill Evans piano solo).A good "test" track is the most successful recording (artistically and commercially) in jazz history, Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue."  Start with the first track ("So What?") and the opening, unaccompanied solo by bassist Paul Chambers (many earphones--and practically all small speakers--can't even reproduce the bassist's sound).  From there listen to the improvised solos--Miles' trumpet, Coltrane's tenor, Cannonball's alto, Bill's piano, assuring yourself that the voice of each is accurate and intimately familiar.  Now listen for Chambers' walking bass sounds (many monitors, earphones, speakers are incapable of picking it up).  How clear are each of the pitches?  Listen to Jimmy Cobb's ride cymbal (a drummer who eschews bebop figures on the snare in favor of a pristine, open, uncluttered and sizzling cymbal sound).  A word of advice: If you're using an iPod, no doubt you've discovered the plethora of EQ settings Apple gives the listener: from your preferred music "genre" (rock, metal, classical, piano, opera, jazz, new age) to your favorite frequencies (boost treble, boost bass, boost mid-range vocals, configure the frequencies for "small speakers," etc.).  Invariably, I've found the most satisfying frequency response, including loudness and presence, is with an EQ setting that's "flat," or "acoustic," or simply "de-activated" altogether.  Messing around with frequencies is no more than a coward's way of compensating for the deficiencies in a pair of phones or speakers.  If the phones are as responsive and full-frequencied as these, however, endeavors to compensate for perceived weakness in reproduction will simply increase the possibilities for distortion.  Remember: No EQ! (or if you don't see that provision, simply select "Acoustic," which should secure all frequencies in the "flat" position.)Conclusion: these phones are as initially impressive as the acclaimed Klipsch S4 phones, costing 5-6 times the price (I had a pair break on me during the first week of use).  Moreover, they're more comfortable and noise-isolating than the two currently favored little overachievers on Amazon--thePanasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphoneand theSony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones.  In fact, these most recent earphones with the weird-sounding name "Go Groove" perform so well I'd lay even money that in a blindfold test they'd easily be confused by the "experts" for some of the most high-end, designer-label Shure, Etymologic, Ultimate Ears, IEM phones.Just a couple of caveats: the cables are as thin and frail as you're likely to find.  While their thread-like quality doesn't appear to affect performance, it does make you wonder a bit about durability.  More seriously (if not inexcusably), there's no designation (at least visible to my eyes) to enable the wearer to distinguish between left and right channels.  For that oversight alone, I'm tempted to subtract a star.  On the other hand, at their current price I'd hate to discourage prospective buyers from opening their musical worlds to sounds they've very likely never heard before.  Use your more expensive pair to determine left from right channels, then scribble on these "Go Groove"'s with a permanent marker, labeling each with the appropriate "L" or "R."  Now try to find some good music--Miles, or Ellington, or Bill Evans, or Toshiko's big band, or E. Power Biggs' pipe organ, or your favorite recordings of Verdi, Brahms, Richard Strauss, even Wagner's "The Ring"--go ahead.  These are killer transducers--so good, I wouldn't even want to compare them to the same maker's higher-grade phones. (Since they couldn't be any better, the more expensive versions would necessarily be anticlimactic.)

$review_text.: Be forewarned...  The microphone I am reviewing does NOT look like the image on the product listing.  It has an additional red LED that indicates transmit power when you key it down.I have owned Ham Radio gear since 1992, probably numbering in the tens of thousands of dollars.  I've used everything from an original HW-101 to the Icom ID-800H and everything in between, including thousands of dollars worth of HTs and accessories.This is the first time I have purchased an accessory and shipped it back IMMEDIATELY.PROS:  The transmit audio from this microphone is &#34;average.&#34;  It is a little warm for my taste, but it is &#34;okay.&#34;  It is not punchy, it is not anything to write home about in the clarity department.  The receive audio is &#34;average.&#34;  When compared to my Pryme SM-101 (an aftermarket mini mic I bought a few years ago for my Kenwood TH-F6A), it is neither as loud nor as clear as the Pryme.  It is &#34;durable enough,&#34; with a case that is neither stronger than nor weaker than any other aftermarket &#34;mini&#34; mic I've ever purchased.CONS:  BUT...  The biggest flaw of this mic is the after-release CLICK you can hear on the transmitted audio.  If you release the button juuuuust right you release the carrier before the click kicks in.  But if you release the button the way most people would - just let 'er go - you hear a LOUD &#34;CHIRP!&#34; on the receiving end of the signal.  In an EmComm or public service situation, that would get monotonous REALLY quickly.Until they figure out how to kill the transmit audio BEFORE the mechanical &#34;CLICK!&#34; kicks in, I would NOT recommend buying this microphone.  Instead, I HIGHLY recommend the Pryme SM-101.  Though it is $14,00 more expensive, it is 100% more pleasant to the ears and does not suffer from the same audible CLICK! (have I gotten the point across?) from which this suffers.And before anyone wonders...I ordered 5 of these microphones in one shipment, one of which came in with a different sequence number.  ALL 5 suffered from the same problem, so it is not an isolated defect.Caveat Emptor.

$review_text.: This is my first projector, and I'm liking it a lot. It will easily project a 100 inch screen in a darkish room. Resolution is OK, even at that size. The one thing I don't like, though, is that seems with a lot of dark parts tend to start looking posterized. In a lot of movies, outdoor, daylight scenes look incredible but indoor, nighttime stuff doesn't look so great. I've gone through all of the different color modes and none of them really fix this.Otherwise, though, this is an amazing projector. The lens shift feature is awesome because you can put the projector off to the side a bit and still get a square image. The fan isn't too loud, at least on Eco mode, and it's so bright I haven't really had to leave Eco mode anyway.Based on build quality and flexibility of options, I would definitely tends to get another Epson when I upgrade from this one at some point.

The second time, Windows did a fix, and then Norton disappeared and I had no protection. Also, got tired of the weak and tinny speakers.  Enough! Returned to the store (Costco) for a full refund.--------------------------The laptop arrived with a non-functioning keyboard. A new laptop was sent a few days later in replacement.I did a lot of research into laptops: I read reviews in Consumers Reports, CNET, Amazon, PC Magazine, and PC World.  Consumers Report rated this Sony highly, and PC Magazine gave it an "Editor's Choice" award.From reading reviews on this and many other brands, it looks like about 10% of all laptops arrive with problems of one sort or another, regardless of brand.  So I wasn't fazed when the first Sony didn't work.  To keep costs down, it looks like the manufacturers basically throw them together and hope for the best. (This is a good reason to find some way to double the manufacturer's warranty to two years, which you can do with some credit cards.)PROS:Good keyboardLots of USB portsHas Intel Wireless Display built in, to view laptop contents on your TV (requires a wireless adapter for the TV).

$REVIEW.: So far I have gotten great results with this lens on my 20D. I have a 50mm 1.8, a Nikon manual 100mm 2.8 with an EOS adapter, and the older (non-IS) 18-55mm kit lens. The 24mm was the perfect complement to my setup, rounding out my prime lenses, and making up for the kit lens. I've gone back and forth about whether or not the 28mm would have been a better value (20-30% cheaper), but I think the wider angle, especially on a cropped sensor, was worth it.I just took ~200 pictures with it of my newborn nephew in the hospital with low indoor lighting (too low for the kit lens), and I was very happy with the speed and field of view of the lens.This lens is great for head shots with a ring light. Close enough to only have someones face in the frame (~1.5-2.5 ft), there is some distortion of features, but I find it not unpleasant, and sometimes I prefer it.Compared to the 50mm 1.8 Mk II, the build quality is great, with a metal mount, a much more solid feel, and a much better manual focus. The manual focus is not as smooth as my Nikon manual lens, or an L-series lens, but I am pleased with it.I can't remember what the minimum focus distance is, but it is much shorter than the 50mm, but not quite as short as the kit lens. It is just right for close-ups of a flower with a landscape in the background.I just recently "discovered" Canon's Digital Photo Professional software for RAW conversion, but sadly it does not have this lens included in the list of lenses that it can adjust distortion and CA for. I have not found that I need those adjustments, but I would have liked to see what they could have done.Overall, I would recommend the lens, but if you have a tight budget, the 28mm, although I have not used it, might not be a bad compromise.
$SUMMARY.: Very happy with the lens

$review_text.: As a travel drive this is great and I found mine on sale for $50, so after 4 months of using it on 5 computers of course I'm pleased. But here's the thing that confuses me.First let me say I've built another like it using my laptop drive I replaced with a SSD and have a Seagate desktop model. I've also built countless external drives since the '90's and I can't understand why supplied software is being used. It's like a free download or a lite version of real backup software and most think you're supposed to use it but it's your choice.So I take the software and all files and put them into a new folder and keep it all but I've yet to use any of it. I use Teracopy (free download) to go back and forth with files and the Windows supplied software for backups and I have nothing to complain about and moving it to multiple computers it's always the same.So whether it's a drive like this or a USB flash or a 5 drive SCSI RAID give that copy of Windows you paid for a chance and use it's backup features, it can be a big advantage when using multiple computers. I'm just trying to help out those who complain about software, but don't really need it and I've always purchased backup drives so my info isn't in the cloud.

 Poked around for a month or so years ago to find a good case for my iPad 1

 Finally happened on to the DoDo and fell in love.I ordered my case for my new iPad 3 right after I got off the phone with Apple

 It arrived and was amazing.Another reviewer was harking on poor customer service


 I can't imagine as DoDo Case has been one of the most friendly, helpful companies I've ever interacted with.This is a case with class


 It isn't a tank case, or a minimalist case


 It's like a moleskin case for you iPad
 I love it
 I'd order another in a heartbeat without question.Give it a whirl
 You'll like it


 Trust me
 It's that good.

$REVIEW.: I guess I got what I paid for.The photos on the brown one are not at all accurate color-wise. Photos show a nice, muted brown color. Actual color is a glossy, nasty reddish brown that is, well, nasty.Also, the product is very, very cheaply made. I know I know, it's only $8 with shipping, why should I complain? I guess I've arrived at the point where I expect electronic accessories to be very cheap but still decent quality, as I've experienced in the past. But with this one, you get what you paid for.2 biggest complaints about the case itself:1. no vertical stand mode.2. The cover &#34;latch&#34; actually grips to the device itself. Which just seems... I don't know. I don't like it. It rubs against the side of my device. It needs to be pushed past it, and will probably rub the paint off if I open and close it enough. Perhaps a greater problem is that the sortof stiff hook thing on the device itself will wear out and stop holding the front cover closed.Anyhow... I would rather have spent the $12-15 on a nicer one. Definitely would have been worth it.
$SUMMARY.: It works, I guess, but color is awful and product is chintzy.

I moved up the spectrum and found these capable of 35hz to 19khz.My "EAR" Test: Celine Dion - Power of Love (Don't laugh:)Tweeters are very directional, Mids are more like mid-tweets. Great low end. Seems to be a little shallow above Sub level and before the Mids kick in. This would make these great for Movies (THX Certified...duh) but no so great for studio monitors. These are almost like wearing headphones but you can still hear the phone ring. No Hum, Low THD, There is PLENTY of bass! I'm keeping these for my desk PC!

$review_text.: Yes, folks, I critiqued the casting (below) but my wife used it on Memorial day and I swear it gave the best, flawless and effort free operation. She apparently tried to prove that she has found the perfect "machine" and she did. I was TOLD to change my review because "I was unfair". I now agree that the functionality is perfect although cosmetic details were ignored by the Quality Control staff at the plant.Like I stated previously, The casting needed TLC & cleaning especially around the adjusting screw. The threads were not cleaned so it took a while to properly assemble. I had to play dentist with my cleaning tools to clear the blocked threads from Aluminum and sand casting.The base can be made a bit larger to make device sturdy,Still, it is one of the nicest pieces on the market

$REVIEW.: This Cat6 cable works fine.  My only quibble with it is that the gray cladding (or jacket) feels a bit thin.  If you look closely at the picture on this site, you can see how the internal twisted pairs make slight lumps in the jacket.  I had expected a cladding thick enough that the cable would feel like one unit.  Instead it feels exactly like it is:  a thin jacket over a bundle of small wires.  This hasn't led to any problems and this was the cheapest 100ft Cat6 patch cable I could find.  So, I really can't complain.  It's just that I hadn't run into such a thin jacket before.  Because of the thin cladding, I'm dropping my rating a star and giving it 4 stars out of 5.

$REVIEW.: If you're looking at this, then you've probably decided on a 50mm or so prime lens, likely because the kit zoom lens is both slow and not very good quality. Here are the options for Canon:Canon 50mm f/1.8 (version 2): It's inexpensive, very fast compared to any cheap zoom and exceptionally good for the price. On the down side, it's cheap feeling, noisy in focusing, and difficult to focus manually. You should buy at least this.Canon 50mm f/1.4: A little bit faster, but that's a less important trait these days with good digital high effective ISOs. More importantly, it's robust, easy to use, with full-time manual focusing (you can just grab the ring even when it's autofocusing), and good image qualitySigma 50mm f/1.4: More expensive than the Canon lens, but slightly better image quality wide open. It's a tough sell since the quality change isn't huge. But if the extra money and Sigma logo don't bother you, then go for it.Canon 50mm f/1.2L: Big money for that extra light-gathering ability. If you need this for photographing in a nightclub, then you'll buy it. If you don't need it, it's too expensive and heavy to compete with the lenses above. That said, it's an amazing piece of kit that I've been lucky to handle a few times.Another, used, option, the original Canon 50mm f/1.8 EF lens was sturdier and better built, but they're only available used and possibly abused. I own one and am happy with it. I have shot with the Canon f/1.4 as well and that's the lens that I'd buy today.

$review_text.: It's amazing how little marketing this awesome tablet is receiving
I've shown this device to a couple of my coworkers, fellow software and hardware engineers, and they all seemed highly interested and made aware that this tablet even existed.My brother owned a Kindle Fire and I got a chance to play around with it

I liked the size, form factor and price

However, the dealbreaker was the lack of a SD/micro SD card slot
As an avid photographer, it would be nice to pull out my cards and view them from a larger screen


Fortunately, I ran into an article stating that Samsung was going to release a 7" tablet that would retail $250 that would include the micro SD slot, in addition, front and rear cameras, GPS, and IR blaster (Note: IR is nice to have, but currently the app that comes with it is flakey - sw issue/ not hw)


Compared to the Fire aside from all those extra components, is that it's also much lighter, thinner and easier to hold.From reading some of the reviews, I've noticed that there are complaints regarding the 8GB built in memory and the inability to transfer apps to the SD card

I currently have about 60 apps installed on the tablet with 3.88GB to spare - no rooting done to remove bloatware, mind you

Media (photos/video/docs) generally uses most of the memory, which if that is the culprit, can be alleviated by transferring via dropbox/app of choice/cable or the micro SD card (also you can change settings to have pics save to card) ;)The gyroscope, or the screen rotation rather, is a bit laggy and it does take about 2 seconds to kick in portrait/landscape mode

Video streaming is smooth and internet browsing works fine with a wifi-dsl connection

Brightness can be easily adjusted by tapping the right hand corner in whatever screen you are in - no need to exit app and dig through the menu.The front and back camera is not very good, pictures taken from it are a tad grainy and noisey - when viewed from the device itself
But hey if you're gonna be picky, you just saved several hundred bucks so you CAN go buy a real camera!!Cable that comes with is about 3' long, users might find it a tad short to be plugged in while in use.Though I pointed out some of the negatives just to make folks aware, in my eyes, they are not dealbreakers


The apps and browsing mechanism works reasonably well and I've used it for a few weeks now with no problems.Overall, a handy device and best bang for your buck on tablets released as of June 2012.

$REVIEW.: I need to buy a gift for my mother's birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks, STAY AWAY!

$review_text.: I needed to lower my monthly bills, so I kicked Dish and got Netflix and found online feeds for alot of "cable" channels(Spike, TNT, USA, etc.) but my rabbit ears would only pick up 1 station on my locals.I found this and was skeptical about buying it due to the price. I saw others almost like it going for $100 and more. But in the end I decided to give it a try. If it was no good-well I only lost $20. I got it from UPS today and hooked it up. Assembly is real easy. I AM STUNNED. For $20, you can not beat it. I now get about 17 channels and 15 of those are crystal clear and in HD. I live about 60 miles from the worst quality channel I get and I am at least 25-30 miles from the best. It claims reception up to 125-150 miles-well I don't know about that but 60 or less I say you can't do much better.I would recommend this to anyone that needs locals and lives within 60 miles or so of the stations they are trying to get.

$REVIEW.: I was so pleased with this hub I sent emails to several friends suggesting they buy one
I have so many devises that need to be connected to my computer that my office looked like a skunk works with wires going everywhere
As soon as it arrived I set it up, plugged everything in, and my desk instantly cleared.I have been able to attach my printer, external hard drive, keyboard, mouse, and god knows every other devise I normally use and they all work perfectly
Everything is now ready for use without having to decide what I want to sacrifice in order to get to a port
The two swivel ports make it easy to plug in my flash drive to quickly download info I want to carry around with me
Like others, I love the blue light
I keep the hub sitting at the side of my desk which faces a wall so the wires are still there but out of sight

$REVIEW.: First of all, you need to follow a simple procedure to see if your laptop has the requirements needed to support this unit
 We used about a year old MacBook Pro, and it worked, no problem!Man, this is a slick little unit


 All you have to do is plug an antenna about the size of a thumb drive into your laptop's USB port, connect the Veebeam unit to a TV using either an HDMI cable or an RCA audio video cable (one of these comes with the unit), turn everything on, and shazzam!  Whatever shows on your computer screen is displayed on the TV screen.We used the RCA cable, because it came in the box.So you can stream video, audio, show photos, etc., on any connected TV using this unit
 The only limitation is that it is line of sight between the computer and the TV


 Aside from that...no problems!I was impressed by the simplicity of operation and sound and audio quality.5 stars!

$review_text.: I purchased this to use a Nikon lens on my Canon body and the adapter surely works. It's pretty thin and I was worried it might have been weak. But I have to say that it seems to be solid.Taking it off is a pain though. As other reviewers said, it's difficult to remove it from the lens. This doesn't bother me too much since I only use it on Canon or on Sony nex through adapter, and I don't need to take it off. consider a different adapter if you have both Canon and Nikon cameras.This is ideal if you have a Canon camera and you can leave this adapter on the lens most (if not all) of the time. If I owned more than one Nikon lens, I would definitely buy multiple copies of this adapter and avoid using only one on all of them.

$review_text.: I bought this router to replace an old Netgear router that lasted a year. According to the sales people at Frys Electronic these things wear out and can last 1 to 5 years.  Per the sales associate, I was unfortunate and it only lasted 1 year. . . I thought I strange that a router is meant to only last a year, but I believed the sales person.  So, I was talked into getting this router, one of the best on the market for the size of my home and for the amount of devices that would hook up.  I loved this router and when it was working, it was great.  Then this past weekend, I woke up to a DEAD router?  Being somewhat handy, I did everything you normally do, reboot, reset the router to factory settings, and turning it off.  Nothing worked.  I contacted Netgeaer customer services for help.  Remember they have 24/7 help?  They don't.  I could not reach a live person and had to send an email instead.  Fine.  I told them what was wrong. I got an email the next day telling me what I needed to do and to let them know the results so they can help me "trouble shoot."  In that email, I was told to click on the link and I would be able to continue this trouble shooting session.  Sounds easy enough except that when I clicked on the link, it said they have no record of this conversation!!  What??  I have a reference/case number.  I have been trying for days to get answers but no luck!!  This was a very expensive router for 4 months and the customer service is NON-EXISTENT!!Terrible and frustrating experience all the way around!UPDATE: Once I posed the review on Amazon, NetGear promptly contacted me to help resolve this problem.  After a dismal start with the customer service department, NetGear stepped up and took care of me!  They could not fix the router via troubleshooting so they replaced my router.  Finally, someone heard me!  Trinity at NetGear made the process move quickly once it was identified that the router was the problem.  I will definitely buy another router from NetGear now that I know they truly stand behind their products and really do care what their customers think!  I've upgraded the product rating to a 5 based on the customer service and a working router!  Thank you NetGear!

Heard Sony may get rid of the sticks and strictly use SDHC cards.  Looks like Sony has a replacement SDHV card for the HX stick but getting poor reviews.  So these are great cards for photos and videos.

$review_text.: Great headset for PS3, can really only be used as wireless headphones on the PC. Although that's more the fault of the technology itself (bluetooth), which won't allow it to use the stereo headphones capability and the mic at the same time. It'll downgrade the quality to mono audio and a still crappy mic. Again that's not the fault of these headphones, it's the fault of the technology and the limitations of Windows working with it, because again, it works great with the PS3, great sound and mic. But my main problem with these was the fact that they couldn't stay connected easily to the PC, I had to repair them a few times just to get proper audio. I decided to dedicate these to the PS3 only.

$REVIEW.: We purchased this for an office along with a 55&#34; Sony KDL-55W802A so that we would have a portable entertainment cart and move it to conference rooms or out on the floor with a PC connected to display high resolution images and content, as well as play some video games.  The cart was fairly easy to put together, although the shelf is a bit flimsier then I expected.  Probably not an issue for most people putting a basic game console or blu-ray player on the shelf, but we have a PC on there so it's a bit shaky.  It's not going to fall or anything, but something to keep in mind.  The actual mount holds the TV firmly and securely, and the lock is a nice touch to prevent people from messing with it too much and moving the TV.The 55&#34; TV is perfectly steady and was extremely easy to mount as well.  The stand is a bit on the shorter side, but it's not too bad.  The TV sits at about eye level for me standing straight up, and i'm 5'7&#34;.  So it's not the tallest thing display cart if you want something big and more visible, but it's adequate for basic viewing.  No issues with the wheels either, the cart moves around great and smoothly, and the locks were fine to keep it in place as well.  The steel construction is very solid and well built, so I have no worries about this falling apart anytime soon.Overall, highly recommended if you need your TV to be portable.

One is the sharp edges of the casing.  Two is it did not come with a remote which I have received on cheaper laptops.  And three is the lack of upper row of buttons such as the volumes.  They are part of the F buttons which I am not a fan of.

$review_text.: I do like this camera very much. Better than a basic point and shoot. Samsung quality, lots of options, auto PC backup function is sweet, uploading to cloud drive is piece of cake. Only thing that has really been an issue is the Samsung link program has some bugs and issues that still need to be worked out. I just use the cloud drive upload function instead, that works for me. The other thing I noticed that when I first installed an SD card it seemed to have an issue recognizing it and had to remove and reinstall, that happened for about the first week every time I turned it on, but that seems to have subsided now. Not sure if it was a card issue or camera issue so cannot knock it for that. Lots and lots of options, manual settings available, touch screen works better than I was expecting, flash is decent. Take the time and download the manual and actually read it, you will be much happier. Yes I would buy it again or as a gift for someone. Good value, good product. Register it online with Samsung and add 3 months to your warranty. Happy shooting!

$review_text.: Ordered this TV arm before I knew which TV I was going to use it on.  Luckily it works for many sizes, however I chose one that was smaller than this TV arm&#8217;s holder accommodates. That was easy enough to fix, as Amazon sells a VESA adapter plate for a TV that has a 100 X 100 mm pattern.  Mind you, not sure why they didn&#8217;t include this in the sizes available.The instruction sheet was all cartoons and very simplistic in a lot of languages, but would have appreciated more depth.  Overall installation was easy and the TV feels very secure.The arm is solid and moves well.  I anticipate moving this arm to a larger TV shortly and feel that I have plenty of hardware.

$REVIEW.: The mouse worked great for 3 month (5 Stars for those 3 month), then the left click stopped working properly, it would register 1 out of 10 clicks which makes it extremely frustrating to use. I've tried to use a different USB port for the receiver, reinstall driver, move all wireless devices away from the mouse, tried it on a different PC, but still no worky. For a premium mouse this is unacceptable and not being able to left click renders the mouse useless (1 Star). The Mouse is cover by warranty, and Logitech is suppose to send me a new one (+1 star) but if that one breaks in 3 month then this will be the last time I buy a Logitech mouse.

$review_text.: Historically I've had pretty good experiences with the Targus brand.  I've been using this Targus docking station for about a month and it's worked well for me.  Really the main thing I use a docking station for is being about to easily connect my laptop to a bigger monitor while at my desk.  I've also got some USB charging stuff plugged into the docking station.First off I read some of the reader inputs on this docking station so the first thing I did was update the drivers.  I'm using standard Wintel setup with a fairly new Dell laptop.  I've had no problems docking my Dell and using the larger docked monitor and USB ports.In terms of build quality this Targus seems good.  My biggest pro is the form factor - smaller than some docking stations I've used in the past.  At $120 the price is a bit high considering you might be able to get your OEM docking station for similar price range (but won't be as usable across multiple computers).  So overall I rate this 4-stars in consideration of price/value.  A bit pricey but small form factor is nice and ability to potentially use across multiple pc's is nice.

This is a very large cooler, but it fits the HP mobo, clears ram and other bits in a very tight fit.  The HP case is small, one case fan, stock intel cooler. Some issues in early runs of the ivy bridge had some chips running too hot, problem was a TIM change, the grease between the heat spreader and the chip had changed formula.  It appears now they have fixed this in later runs. I like air coolers, even if the fan fails, the passive cooling is enough to prevent a problem, till you can swap out a fan. Water is fine, but two things can fail, and there is little passive cooling with a failed pump. Sure, you get lower temps. On an editing rig, stock clock and cooling makes it quieter and last longer. Cooler on this mobo was a minor problem since it has screw mounts and a back plate, and you only have two short screws from the AMD kit that fit the intel bracket that goes on the mobo. So you have to scavenge two more screws or hit Ace. If the mobo has holes for the plastic pins its easy. Comes with stock grease, I used my own favorite, but theirs is fine, good idea to have some more, in case you mess up the pre applied grease. Tighten down with longer included screws to the metal bracket for intel, being careful to check the rear side bracket with the fan off, to make sure you have it down flush on the mount, tighten one screw at a time when finger tight. Idle temps on stock were 33-35c, load 60-63 running core temp and heavy load. After a few heat up cool down cycles, best tested with case open, to make sure you got the cooler down flat and see that temps are stable. You can get a reading on the new cooler, in a small case, the freezer aims back at the single case fan in the HP, which is a much better cooling situation. Always order a bigger ps than 300, they had a 460watt for 30 bucks more. These cases do not have a bottom fan on the ps, its a rear fan, having two fans blowing in push pull saves it from high heat. All these things, HP, Dell prebuilt, are short on cooling in the smaller cases. New temps were 26-27c idle, 51-53c load at 100% cpu use, this means it the system is rendering a large file for half and hour, temps will stay under 60c. A bit of overhead. would have been easy if I knew the mobo had screw holes not holes for pop in plastic pins. This varies mobo to mobo. Sound, intel stock on mine ran ok, but under load was noisy. This cooler under load is audible but a lower softer sound, and idle. Case is cooler. Even if you do not oc it lasts longer cool, and I hate high pitched fan noise.

$review_text.: This infrared remote works fine with my Canon 60D


The fit and finish are excellent

It does come with a battery, but I don't know yet whether it's a &#34;demo&#34; battery (i.e., will die soon) or a real full-capacity battery


It does not have the case described with the Canon-branded equivalent product (RC-6), but I'll do without the case for the $14 saved.

I guess it's my own fault but I searched specifically for Lightscribe cd's and this Verbatim package was listed within these search parameters


Not sure if I'm going to keep or return them

$REVIEW.: SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 4 GB MP3 Player (Black)I bought this to give to my brother who loves to listen to music. The computer detected the player initially. So, I started to load it with music; I spent several hours doing it. When I was done, I wanted to try it. I hooked it up to my earphones, but it wouldn't even turn on! No matter what I did, it wouldn't work. I've had one Sansa MP3 player before that gave me many hours of enjoyment, so I didn't have any apprehensions buying this one. But this was a total disappointment. Not recommended.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to try astrophotography, and not spend a ton of money and see if I'd like it (I have a Celestron C8-SGT scope, f10).  The camera is built very well, and rugged.  Note - the camera acts like a 7mm eyepiece, so the computer view in the 640x480 format makes jupiter very big.  iCap software works well in managing the camera and capturing the video (note - 20 to 25 sec video is between 65MB to 95MB .avi format).Two items that strongly influence the quailty is the &#34;Seeing Conditions&#34;, and focusing.  Just take your time and make sure you have a good focus.  What makes it tough is the image is bouncing and fuzzy due to seeing conditions (wind currents, etc..). Note - I live in a light polluted area.RegiStar 6.1 works well, the problem is there is no detailed instruction manual.  The manual that comes with camera gives you  basic guidelines on to features to use and what settings, but does not explain what these picks actually do, and the best way to improve the photo.So I used different sources; articles in Sky & Telescope website, and Astronomy website.  Instructional video's in Youtube, and websearches for RegiStax 6.1.  In a relatively short time (2 weeks) I was making really nice photo's with this setup.  A couple of my shots compete with Jupiter pictures on the internet!!!What I enjoyed was viewing the image on my computer screen, play with the exposure, and gain to improve the shot.  Then capture the image.

$REVIEW.: This is a large speaker with nice sound quality but average to low volume.  I expected more sound volume for the size.  I do like the fact that once charged this will go 12 hours without a charge. I also like the look of the speaker.I have used this primarily with an MP3 player.  I like the 12 hour play time once charged.  It connects easily with my MP3 player.  I like the handle on the speaker which makes it easy to carry around and I also like the look. I also used this as a Bluetooth speaker for my phone.The sound quality is nice for a speaker like this.  The music sounds good.  The problem is it not as loud as I expected for a speaker of this size.  No matter how much I press the button to increase the sound the volume is lower than I want.  I called Mipow regarding this issue and left a message with my phone number but never got a response.  I did use this as a Bluetooth speaker for my phone and the sound seemed a bit stronger but I thought it could have been louder.I like the size and look of this. The sound quality is good but I wish the volume was higher.

$REVIEW.: When I was preparing to go on a trip to Eirope this summer, I decided a new camera case was in order. The one I had held everything admirabl, but it was not comfortable to carry. When I first saw this Case Logic case, I recognized this as the solution to many problems. Because it can be carried like a backpack, it solved the problem of never having enough hands to carry everything. Plus, thee was room for all of my various chargers(phone, camera, Kindle) plus room for my Kindle and and a few other odds and ends I like to have on the plane. It's design, with the zipper on the side against my back when wearing it, made it much more secure while wearing. Plus there was a nifty way to carry my tripod as well whenI wanted to.I have bee using it for 6 months now, and would not want to be without it.

$review_text.: I received the DMS case and I was expecting the worst, after reading some of the reviews on here. I am pleased to say that none of the problems that other people mentioned were apparent with my case. The iPad fits snugly inside the case...and there is a little loop on the top right corner that insures the iPad does not fall out. The case is quite nicely talored with stitching around all the edges as a nice added touch. The snap fastens securely and there is NO snap (metal material) on the side of the flap that goes over the iPad so I have no idea what some of the other people were talking about. Sorry, but the case IS leather so, once again, the other people complaining this was not the case must have received a case from a different supplier. The cover and the stand both have very small magnets within the material that makes the cover flap stay closed on the iPad when the case is closed and keeps the stand from dangling off the back. All in all, a very well designed case for the iPad. My only complaint is that there is really no way to stand the iPad upright(vertically)....only horizontally as indicated in the product pictures. Would I recommend this folio case to others....absolutely!!!

$review_text.: I have found nothing wrong with the item.For those of you complaining about the fan being to loud. IT'S NOT. The idiots who put this thing together placed the fan in such a way that the power cable is STUCK in the fan. It's an easy fix. Simply unscrew the fan and reposition the cable at an angle where it doesnt hit the fan. Done.I hoped this helped, because before I realized this, I was looking for a new odd ball sized 80x80x20 sized fan to replace it.

$REVIEW.: I beg to differ with other positive reviews here. I'm using a 700mhz iBook with OS X. The operating system saw the device right away, and it worked flawlessly. The sound quality, however, was much, much worse than my home CD Player/NAD amp/B & W speakers. The sound quality out of the Xitel unit was very close to the sound quality coming straight off the analog headphone jack of the iBook. My thought when I heard the unit was, "[a few of my hard earned bucks]something that boosts my levels a little, but sounds no better..." I'm sorry Xitel, you'll have to do better than this. Try at least to sound as good as a $50 portable CD player, and then I'll be interested.

$review_text.: The router is a significant improvement over my previous Netgear router, which was about 2 years old - ancient in Internet time. The router is stored 3 floors below 2 of our wireless users. One user is plugged into the router directly.The direct connection is fabulous. There are occasional hiccups, but these could be the DSL service. It's hard to tell.The wireless users usually have strong connections. But when they used the WPN111 adapters, they had lousy connections. For several minutes at a time, there would be no connection. The connection was always sporadic. Switching to an internal PCI card improved the connection tremendously, underscoring the fact that the problem was with the adapter and not the router.The blue light is an annoyance, but newer models have a button on the back for turning off the LED light.I recommend the router with one reservation. If you must use a USB adapter, don't buy this model. It works only with the WPN111, which Netgear should have killed before it ever came to market.

$REVIEW.: First off, you will lose some sharpness and contrast with this teleconverter
Second off, you will lose some sharpness and contrast with every teleconverter so you should be aware of this before buying one

Third off, you will not lose as much sharpness and contrast with this teleconverter as you will with previous iterations or with generic third party converters
If you need a 2x teleconverter for compatible Nikon lenses, this is the way to go.I mostly use this with a 70-200mm f/4 as I don't particularly need a faster 400mm nor do I feel like paying for one (let's not even mention how heavy a 400mm prime can be)
In this particular case, it's superb and requires just a touch of sharpening and contrast adjustment in Photoshop or Lightroom
Focusing isn't super fast on a D600, but it's adequate
If I was going for better performance here then I would have bought a more substantial 400mm
I've also used it with a 300mm f/2.8 and I can get away without additional sharpening in post, but just because I can get away with it doesn't mean that I will


Focus speed is also pretty excellent with the 300mm (effectively a 600mm f/5.6)

Overall, I'm pleased


It does precisely what I want it to, nothing more and nothing less.

$review_text.: This product has mixed reviews but I decided to give it a try
I was looking for a cheap replacement stereo for my brother in law as he was dissatisfied with his current stock setup but wasn't looking for anything fancy

I figured a bluetooth setup would be convenient for driving and talking so this would be a perfect setup for someone whose budget shopping for a stereo
When it arrived I had very mixed feelings about it, and I really had to let it set in for a few days before I decided to send it back all together...
and here's why.It looks a lot like a toy radio and I found it hard not to take it seriously
I felt like I would be insulting him by giving this to him
The next complaint, although it is a Bluetooth receiver that could be used for hands free it's mic is built into the unit itself
This causes a couple problems as you will receive a ton of background noise, it more than likely is a mufti-directional mic so have fun trying to be heard on a phone call, and I couldn't attempt to add a small windsock If i wanted to, which is a huge problem if you roll the windows down.Its not a horrible product, but its not something I would recommend buying if you take care of your car
I would think this would best fit in older vehicles for people who do not currently have a working radio and are buying it for themselves


Gifting this to someone could be taken as a joke.

$REVIEW.: The &#34;interface&#34; reminds me of one of the early digital cameras. The threw away the UI &#34;book&#34; and created a unique interface, poorly. It's clunky and feels really cheap. I ordered the recommended 4GB card and loaded a bunch of JPGs on it. It would not display any of the pics. I put the same pics on a USB flash drive and it showed a few, with some fiddling. I'm pretty sure I'm going to send this thing back and try something different. The instructions are totally useless. They offer no help on how to format pictures (if that's even the issue) not does it give any specs on what kind of storage devices are compatible. I'm pretty sure the &#34;recommended&#34; card isn't compatible. Who knows, though? Maybe it's my pictures that are incompatible. Since there's no way to know, and there's no way I'm calling tech support for a picture frame, and since there are endless other options, opting for a return seems like the best idea. Don't buy this thing.

$REVIEW.: Only issue is the zippers.  The light fabric sseems to get stuck much like the zipper on a cheap sleeping bag.  The light material folds over ahd gets caught in the zipper.  With some care this doesn't happen but it is a bit frustraing since many zippers found a way around this with shields and curves.  It is black, double walled and keeps the light out though which is its main purpose and it is large enough for a couple 35mm development cans each with two stainless reels inside. Finally, it isn't too expensive.  Just wish they had better zippers.

$review_text.: This is a great, affordable, protective case for larger GPS units.  Having recently picked up aGarmin 2555LMTunit, I went on the hunt for some form of protective case, as we will be moving it among three vehicles between my wife and myself. it's not a Pelican case, but I don't expect it to be, especially for such a great price.  It feels very well made, all the stitching is well done, there are no outside seams, and the zipper is a good density (not so coarse as to be hard to use, but not so fine that it would be susceptible to damage).  It is roomy enough that it easily stores the 2555LMT and its somewhat bulky Traffic-enabling power cable.  The windshield mount obviously won't fit, but that doesn't matter as much to us.Time will tell in terms of wear and tear, and I'll update this review if anything crops up, but I would definitely not hesitate to pick up another one of these cases, should the need arise.

$REVIEW.: This is a 2597LMT--not a 2557I thought this would be an upgrade from my 1490LMT, but it seems to be the opposite.PRO:1.  Lighter and thinner.2.  Voice command works.  Too bad you cannot add other items like routes, Settings, and trip planner to the options.3.  School zone alerts.4.  Now says "Turn at traffic light instead of "200 feet."CON:1. Screen is not as bright/contrasty as the 1490. Garmin has REMOVED the ability to increase the contrast!!2. Over scan causes/requires a wierd contortion of you hand to press the signal bars to get into satellite view; else you just get Go To to come up.3. Even changing "Country themes" (has nothing to do with countries--LOL) doesn't improve the color much. THIS unit will reflect your clothes, etc. on the screen and diminish quality.4. Head on view is washed out and unsaturated. Screen must be tilted up a little for better readability.5. Garmin deleted the clip-on bracket making removablity from the mount more difficult. The ball now sits in a socket on the back. No longer a quick, one hand release.  It appears very prone to breakage since several companies now show replacements from $5-15!6. IMPORTANT-- Neither the Garmin manual (which comes up generically as 2507), nor support web site explains what cable is required for the Traffic to work. Using the one that comes with uses one wire as "antenna." Any wire in close proximity SHOULD do that. They have crossed some wire in the USB cable making it non-standard.7. Power button does NOT turn off the unit.  It puts it in sleep mode--with no warning.  You must hold the of button until a screen prompts you if you want to power down. Or else the battery is still being used.8. LOST is the ability to have three or four pieces of information up.  ONE only now: Arrival time, altitude, ETA, Direction, etc.  A downgrade!!9. If you have a newer car with Bluetooth phone connection, USE THAT.  The Garmin is restictive to what phones it talks to and how well it does so.Why Garmin monkies with things that work is beyond me.  The 1490 has a dual wire cable which includes the Traffic receiver and antenna.  This came with a plain USB to power cable, with no explanation.  1490 had Contrast adjustment--IMPORTANT!However, when the unit is turned on and you go to settings, the unit goes into "Searching."  But a message right in the Traffic box says, "accessory required." Even with their power cable attached.  They WANT YOU to buy a $69 cable for better reception. The only accesory I can find is the $70 HD Traffic c

$review_text.: Is the Antec 902 superior to the 900?  Not necessarily.I own 2 Antec 900s and worked on a 902 for a client build
 Both cases are very similar.Both offer:1
Excellent cooling2


Excellent versatility902 offers these features over the 900:1


Dust shields for all 120mm fans.2

Fan speed controls mounted on case3
Hole in case under CPU area (for gently lowering mobo w/ heavy heatsink)4


200mm fan is easier to remove than in 900.5


Better top of case design for ipod.6
Better finishHowever, the 900 has these going for it:1

All 120mm fans are interchangeable and easily replaceable.2
HDD cages can be moved 1/2" forward to give more clearance between mobo & hdds.In both of my 900 cases, I removed the 200mm fan completely and also moved the rear 120mm fan to the side (putting cardboard in the 120mm hole
 This same procedure is more difficult on the 902 because the motor control for the 200mm and rear 120mm are linked together
 Therefore, the rear 120mm fan cannot be relocated to the side.The front 120mm hdd fans also cause problems in the 902 because of the integrated fan control speed knob


 It's not a problem in the 900.I need to say that I prefer positive-pressure case with all fans used for blowing in fresh air.In conclusion, both cases are great
 However for me the "more primitive" 900 case suits me just a bit better for my builds.

$REVIEW.: So I will say that these really are the BEST screen protectors you can get. However, they do take some know-how to install. I have been putting Zagg InvisibleShield's on my electronics for YEARS. I still have an 80 gb ipod classic that looks absolutely original because I put one of these on there about 8 years ago. No peeling. No discoloration. Still in perfect condition even after EIGHT YEARS! I never use any other screen protector, as these are so great.Now, I will say I don't think the average person can install these the way they need to be done. Hence so many negative reviews. I've never looked at the instructions, so I'm not sure how good they are. But watch some youtube videos to see if you're up to it. These are not some screen you protector that you just peel off a paper and slap it on your device (ipad in this case). To install them you need to the wet &#34;solution&#34; they send. If you're not comfortable getting your device quite wet on the screen (and back if you do the full body) these ARE NOT FOR YOU.The key to get these installed correctly is1. BE PATIENT. Generally I spend 15-20 minutes installing a full body (front and back).2. You really have to SOAK the surface you are applying the Zagg to. I have seen many people screw these up, and it's generally because they do not get the surface wet enough. With the 100+ devices I have installed these on, I have never had a single one ruined from getting a little wet during this process.3. Make sure the surface is absolutely clean.4. Wash your hands with soap and water before you start.5. Before you remove the Zagg, spray solution on your fingers.If you start having to pull the Zagg off over and over, you probably didn't apply enough solution. You should be able to put the film/protector down on the device, and then have it move freely with the solution underneath. This allows you to put it in the exact location you want it (all holes and buttons lined up correctly). Then you use the squeegee starting in the middle and push out. Use moderate force. Get as much solution out as you can. After the initial install, for a day or two, there WILL BE BUBBLES. Leave your device out in dry area for a couple days and all the bubbles will disappear.I have had fantastic results with these. I'm not sure why so many negative reviews. All I can think of is people just don't know how install these.These also have a LIFETIME guarantee. You just pay for them to mail you a new one. Put your old one back in the provided envelope, put a stamp on it, and mail back your old one. It is that easy. I have replaced MANY of these and Zagg has NEVER given me any trouble. But you MUST KEEP YOUR OLD ONE to send back.And if you just can't install one of these, take it BestBuy. They can install them there.

$REVIEW.: Gold plated tips and quality material, make these a great buy.  At the moment, I only need one cable, but purchased three of them.  These are very inexpensive compared to the local stores, and I hate having to pay $20-$30 for one that costs as little ($5.49 in this case) as they do here.  My children are grown and sometimes need cables, so having an extra one saves them money too.How do they work.  Just great.  I used one to hook up my new Samsung surround sound system.  The sound quality is amazing...so, I have to rate these cables a five.If you're looking for nice quality, soft, optical cables, don't hesitate to buy these.  I highly recommend them.Just don't forget to take off the little rubber protective end caps before using them.  The gold tips must be exposed in order to plug them in.  This is a no brainer, but I've read of people failing to do this.  So, just a kindly reminder.

It is a non-standard connection to the headphones - smaller than USB micro.  I get that they probably wanted to do everything in their power to keep these headphone units smaller, but this is a pain.  Everywhere I go I have microUSB chargers.  My car.  My nightstand.  My desk.  My kitchen.  You will need to use this USB cable to charge these.  And the cable is very very short.  Like &lt;2 feet.The real kicker is that this port is maybe 10% smaller in total size than microUSB.  Seems like poor design.

No lockups, no signal drops, everything works great. It also works just fine with all of my other Linksys routing equipment.If you are having connection drops or other issues with your current cable modem, this one is worth a try.

$REVIEW.: Pros:- great pictures- audio notes/comments- the lens does not telescope out from the case- good low light performance- large screen, but still room for buttons- great video- natural light/flash dual modeCons- like all compact cameras, resolution is limited to about 3-5 MP- Under low light levels, auto white balance can be slightly off- no panoramic mode- no histogram- a little slow to turn on and store images- the audio notes is difficult to accessNOTE TO THOSE WHO DISPLAY PICTURES AT 100% ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN:THE LIMIT OF RESOLUTION IS ABOUT 5MP FOR A COMPACT CAMERAFirst my standard comments about compact cameras with these tiny sensors (1/2.33") - it is easy to show (I am an optical physicist, so at least it is easy for me) that it is physically impossible to get 12 MP resolution even if the lenses were perfect. In fact, the theoretical limit under the most perfect conditions is about 9 MP for this size lens. However, under average lighting conditions and lens settings, you can expect 3 to 4 times less. For example my test shots show about 2MP resolution for the Exilim z75 and nearly 4MP for the Fuji Z70. So if you think you want to get a 12 MP camera as an upgrade to your 5 MP camera or even 3 MP camera, save your money. You need a bigger and much better lens. The high-end Canon SD4000is camera actually achieves 5MP with a larger lens, under ideal conditions, based on measurements. If you want a real upgrade in a pocket camera, look there. Contrast this with a full frame 35 mm DSLR. The theoretical limit is well over 100 MP and the achievable real life resolution is 8 MP, based on actual measurements with a Nikon D3s.WHY DO THEY PUT 12 MP SENSOR IN A CAMERA THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY TAKE A 12MP PICTURE?There are two reasons. The first is that 12MP sensors are cheap nowadays and you'd rather buy a camera that says "12MP sensor" than "5MP sensor." Admit it, you would. But there is a second reason to have twice as many pixels as the measured horizontal and vertical resolution. Some things are on a diagonal. So you need more pixels. The other thing is, the pixels are not "color" pixels but either red, green or blue. In theory you need about 3 times as many pixels to get color pictures. But in reality, the camera processor synthesizes a color picture from fewer pixels by making good guesses about what the color of something is. So the bottom line is you probably need about twice as many pixels as the actual resolution limit. That means about 5 MP for a low end compact camera and about 10 MP for a higher end compact camera, and 16 MP for a high end full frame DSLR. So, in the Finepix Z70, 8MP would have been enough to get all the performance you'll ever get out of this one. The test photos (see comments) indicate that the FinePix Z70 easily beat the Exilim resolution and is close to 4 MP of resolution.THIS CAMERA (LIKE MOST COMPACT POINT AND SHOOT MODELS) LETS YOU TAKE A PICTURE EVEN WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE HOPELESSLY BLURREDThe second drawback to the inexpensive compact cameras is the small lenses and cheap sensors combined with the point and shoot approach, can result in the user trying to take pictures under impossible conditions. The camera probably warns you with an icon in the viewscreen (such as a shakey hand) but you will ignore it and take the picture anyway and be disappointed and blame the camera. Indoors at night in natural light is always going to result in a picture with a lot of digital noise and probably a bit blurred as well.  The flashes in these cameras are very low power because there is not a huge battery in the camera, so you really can't take acceptable flash pictures more than a few feet away. It is unrealistic to expect any pocket camera to take great pictures at a party. The best you can hope for are the typical flash pictures that have bright foregrounds and very dark backgrounds. With a stabilized DSLR at high ISO and a nice f/1.4 lens, you can do natural light shots that compact cameras can only dream of. One way around this, is that the higher end compact cameras now take several short exposures and do a shift and add to synthesize a single picture. If things (other than your hand) aren't moving much, this trick works well, especially if you have optical stabilization. If you want to take low light level pictures in natural light, I suggest you look at the Sony DSC-TX7 or the Canon SD4000is or similar $300+ cameras. By contrast, a modern SLR can offer ISO ratings of several thousand, (compared to a few hundred for a pocket point and shoot) enabling handheld shots under low light conditions.BASED ON THE Z700This camera, the Z70, is the non-touch screen version of the Z700 and has a cheaper sensor and a cheaper processor. The Z700 in turn, is "inspired" by the Sony DSC-TX7 which I have also reviewed. The Fuji lacks the panoramic mode, the high dynamic range mode, and the exceptional low light mode of the Sony, but it is about half the price. Of course, the Z70 is about 1/3 the price, so, do not expect anything approaching the performance of the more expensive models. That said, the performance is very decent for a $100 camera.PERFORMANCECompared to cameras in its class, the Finepix does a fine job in bright light. I personally like the buttons better than the touchscreen, but you may feel differently. As in all my reviews, I have taken pictures of nearly identical scenes for comparison and posted them. Amazon tends to remove my links from the reviews, however. So let me say again that the resolution was easily 4 MP worth meaning about 1800 vertical lines. The 5x zoom range also beats some other low priced cameras.In bright daylight, the pictures are generally excellent. They are perhaps slightly saturated, reminding me of Agfachrome film, but very pleasing. This camera does not have a sophisticated multi-point metering systems, so I sometimes have to adjust the exposure up or down 2/3 of a stop. Be very careful, because it sets the exposure according to whatever is in the cross-hairs of the viewfinder.There is a sunset mode which allows you to take realistic exposures and not having the white balance messed up by trying to correct the scene to daylight. If you have tried to take sunset pictures with a point and shoot camera before and been disappointed, then this feature is for you.Under low light conditions, a fairly usable picture can be taken, if the camera is steadied, and you do not zoom in. The automatic white balance occasionally seems to do a poor job under low-level incandescent lighting, which you can override for stills, but movies are always in automatic white balance mode, so they can sometimes come out looking slightly yellowish under these conditions.Like most users, I tend to use this in the fully auto mode, but, unlike many point and shoot cameras, there is a "program" mode in which you can still adjust the exposure up or down from the metered value.I find that a 4 GB SD card is big enough for me, but I don't take a lot of video. If you do, you might want to go larger. The battery life is better than average which means more than 150 pictures per charge (a mixture of flash and non-flash pictures). The USB connector is a non-standard one, so make sure you don't lose it.I always respond to comments, so don't be bashful. If you only have $100 to spend and want a shirt pocket camera, this might be for you. I used to say I preferred my Casio, but I have changed my mind. After a year of using the FinePix z70, it is my favorite tiny camera.I have updated this review from my initial review of Jan 2011. What I have learned is that the auto white balance is usually good, and that the exposure compensation is actually pretty handy and works well. Also, the "night" shooting mode is what you want to use whenever you have low light conditions. Automatic scene recognition is good if you want to let the camera do all of the thinking, but you get no control over your picture at all. I also now have a Canon T3i DSLR - shooting with big image stabilized lenses and ISO 3200, the DSLR allows me to take very acceptable photos in very low light indoors hand held. Do not expect to come anywhere close to this with a pocket camera, with lenses that are only 5 mm in diameter, compared to the 50mm diameter lenses on a DSLR.

$REVIEW.: Do you want thrills?  Excitement?  An experience beyond all others that you will take with you for the rest of your life that you will tell your grandchildren about with baited breath?Well you're out of luck, this is a small leather belt carrying case for a camera or ipod.  It provides none of those things, just basic functionality.  You put things in it, the Velcro snaps, they stay there and it holds.I can't say it's much better or worse than any other I've seen, Yeah it's a case, yeah it does the job, it looks ok, black goes with everything.So it's not all that exciting, but it holds the camera.  Then again you could take the camera ON a great adventure and this would hold it while you record those thrills and adventures.  So maybe it's more exciting than I thought.

I am sure the sony must have something more, oh, that is right, the sony uses 400 watts of power, my Sharp uses 120 watts of power. Hmmm. guess the energy star sticker is there for a reason. Only problem is had to get a different wall mount, My New Aquos has a non vesa standard bolt pattern on rear. This is not going to mean anything if you just set it on the stand, but if you plan on wall mounting, be sure to get the universal mount. It has a 440 mm blot pattern.Cheers

$REVIEW.: They put a heatsink on this thing for a good reason
I don't think I've ever installed a network adapter that gets as hot as this thing does

You can burn your fingers, it gets that hot
I'm actually looking around my old parts for a bigger heatsink I could put on it.This adapter supports a variety of protocols and options, however, you will have to find the documentation and research configuration options on your own
The documentation is available at HP's website, but it is somewhat incomplete


This adapter is meant for servers, but it works fine on my X58 based motherboard

The drivers support 802.3ad (a link aggregation protocol for binding multiple ports), so if you have a managed gigabit switch, you should have little trouble utilizing both ports.The adapter arrived in a box by itself


No documentation or driver disc, but most likely if you're buying this thing you already have some idea what you doing and know where to go

The adapter appears to be a surplus replacement part or from of some kind of bulk inventory.

$REVIEW.: I have had the 16 GB version since release date and it is true what everyone says that this is the best tablet you can get for $200/$250 depending on the storage size.  Good display of 1920 x 800, tegra 3, long battery life, front facing camera, corning glass, GPS, you even get a free $25 for use in google play.  Now, everybody should know by now all these features as to how it trumps the kindle fire but I just wanted to point out the experiences that I did not like:1. my tablet had the "screen separation" issue that a lot of people experienced which means that the left side is creaking when pressed.  Apparently, the screw inside was not tight.  Google was quick though to ship a replacement while I hold on to my tablet until I actually receive the new one.2. I hate it that when a new Android version comes along that the app developers are slow to make it compatible.  With Android 4.1, you will not be able to install HBO Go, TWC TV, Viber, not even Amazon shopping app.  HBO took months before they released an app compatible with ICS, so do I have to wait months again before I can watch on jellybean???  I think this is where Apple really shines as compatability is rarely an issue, anyway.  I would not have mind if they shipped this with ICS first with option to upgrade.3. I hope for more apps that fully utilize the Tegra 3 processor.4.  SD card slot would have made it more perfect, but kindle does not have it as well.But for the price and the open Android experience, and the reliable Asus brand, you cannot go wrong with this one. Very fast, above average display, great battery.

 They all seem to be slightly different and someone else reported problems with an S2.She is using it with a Panasonic KX-TCA430 wired headset


 She prefers using a wired headset so she doesn't need to deal with charging and bluetooth connection


 The volume of the incoming audio could be a little louder, but that could vary with different headsets
 At first the 2.5mm plug on the headset did not seem to seat completely in the jack of this adapter and I thought it didn't work, but a firm push seated it all the way in and then it worked fine.

$review_text.: Wow.  This is a truly amazing little camera.  I bought this to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  I had my coolpix for just over 12 months when it broke, due to no fault of my own, and it was going to cost $150 to repair.  Rather than repair a camera that I liked but didn't love, I decided to make a new purchase.My initial intention was to purchase a Canon Rebel, I have used my mom's in the past and really love that camera.  I loved using the interchangeable lenses and the ability to manually focus.  Seeing the cost though ($500+,) plus the cost of additional lenses, it just wasn't in my price range at the moment and I needed a new camera urgently.  If you're looking for a DSLR, do not expect this to function the same.  It's a powerful little camera, but it is NOT a DSLR.  If you're an amateur photographer and have no intention of taking a class to learn how to use the functions of a DSLR, this is a perfect camera for you.So began my research.  It became a toss up between the Canon SX510 and the Nikon L820.  Reviewers were split between the two, some preferring the Nikon, some preferring the Canon.  They seemed to come out about even except in a few minor categories, and having been very pleased with the Canon Rebel, I decided to go with the Canon despite it costing about $30 more than the Nikon.Pro's-*30x Optical zoom - awesome, no more grainy pictures of kids on stage during performances*Built in wifi - go ahead and upload your pics to facebook, send them to your phone, or directly to your wireless printer.*Manual setting - can do your own iso settings, white balance, shutter speed etc.  The auto setting works fabulously in most cases, far better than any camera I've ever owned, but the option is there for those times it's just not adjusting quite how you want it.*CMOS sensor provides for a clearer image, especially on the macro setting, than my own eyes give me.*Zoom assist - for when you use your 30x zoom but lose your subject*Size - for anyone that has gone hiking with a DSLR and multiple lenses, you know what a pain that can be.  This lighter camera is perfect for running around and still has a lot of the qualities that you'd look for in a DSLR.  So unless you're out taking professional shots, this comes in really handy*Discreet mode - This is a setting on the dial, great for those events when there is no flash allowed.  In this mode, the camera doesn't make noise when turning it on, nor does the flash go off.  Even if the camera goes off and you turn it back on, because it is set on the dial, it doesn't reset itself.  I've accidentally had my flash turned back on so many times that way on previous cameras.Cons -*Very poor manual - A lot of skipping around to get one thing done.  IE Looking through the start up manual, it says "for instructions on attaching (the lens cap cord and neck strap) please see the user manual on the canon website"  Granted, it wasn't difficult to figure out, but there was no clear spot for the lens cap cord, and it is something that should have been included in a "start-up" manual.  Another example of a poor manual, referring to the downloadable pdf manual...say you want to learn how to use the miniature setting...so it says "miniature setting, pg 48"  You go to pg 48 and it says to follow steps 1 and 2 on page 46....okay back to page 46, got that down, back to page 48.  It seems to be this way when trying to learn how to access any of the features.  I can't fault the actual camera for this, but definitely Canon.  I actually made up my own cheat sheet for accessing my favorite features until I have it down.*No ability to manually focus - Being that this camera is not a DSLR, I didn't expect or really even hope for this feature.  I would have liked it, but for the $$, I definitely can't complain and will upgrade in the future.*Mirrorless - I would definitely prefer to use a viewfinder, I am used to going without though, so it's easy to work around.*No Raw Shooting - this feature doesn't apply to most people, but sometimes I prefer to use it*No Touch Screen - This is taking time for me to get used to, I find myself constantly tapping the screen.  My last 2 cameras, going back to 2010, have been touch screen, so I'm surprised to find this camera doesn't have one.Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of accessing the wifi, this was fairly easy for me and took about 15 minutes max.  It's a little more work than it typically takes to connect a device to wifi,and you have to use the computer to do it, but it's still not overly difficult.Despite the cons, I'm still incredibly impressed with this camera and it has definitely earned 5 stars when taking into account the type of camera, the construction, and the value.  I'm very happy with this purchase despite the fact that I was hoping for my next camera to be the Rebel.  I never imagined I'd get a camera of this level of quality for under $400.  (I paid $229, could have bought a slightly cheaper one, but wanted one that was Amazon fulfilled and prime)

Now I know in a true server you don't want that - but come on this is kind of a 'home' or very small business tool anyway.No hot swap drives - if it was a real business tool it would have.Now I know a lot of folks posting and buying are real computer folks (and I was in the industry too - but I know many are more skilled with hardware than I am).  But simple things like having to root around the HP site to find things versus getting a disk included like other motherboards can be a real time waster.  Things like the RaidXpert app you need to rebuild an array.  Again since is 'home' targeted - save these users some frustration.  Can they figure it out...sure - but unless you're just looking for a project to chew up some time...consider.And if you are using with Freenas - no WOL with the NIC.So if you are a 'home' (or most very small businesses that would use this) - get a nice micro-ATX board with 6 SATA ports and built-in raid - a case that accepts 4 (or more drives - heck you'll not be limited to the 4 this thing holds if you do).  If you want to save on your power(not a bad idea) - use a mini-itx board and add in SATA card to expand out to 4+ drives and you'll be way ahead of the game!

$review_text.: This case is great in so many ways!  First of all the design is very slim and enhances the iPad Air rather than detracting from the lightness and slim form factor

 The white color is a perfect match for the white iPad


The workmanship and finish of the case is top notch


 The holes all align perfectly and the magnets work fine


Also, the designers thought of it all - they even made the cover just very slightly overlap the iPad so it's easy to open it and you don't have to go digging around with your fingernail.I did order another genuine leather case with the original Apple style as I like the no fuss and simplicity of the stand function where the cover fits into the tab in the back.Unless the leather case is superb, this Poetic case and the other red one I ordered will be my go to cases.



$SUMMARY.: Thrilled with this case!

$REVIEW.: I still stand by everything in the review below, but it has come to my attention that Boxee is no longer supporting this device as it has moved on to the new Boxee TV.  There will be one more Flash update, then it will be in maintenance mode - [...]While the box should continue to work for what I mainly use it for, which is watching network content over my home network, it's still sad to see Boxee leaving this product to die while their new product has zero of the home network streaming capabilities that this machine had.As of right now, it may be better to build you own home theater PC if you mainly need a network streaming device.----- ORIGINAL REVIEW -----The Boxee Box is, by far, my favorite thing attached to my television set.  It has replaced my Roku which now just sits sadly in my media rack unused.  It's replaced having to use my Tivo to slowly transfer and watch video content served from my network on my television.  It's an amazing device for someone with enough tech know-how to set it up and use it.  I use it to watch my movies and television shows that have been ripped to my NAS device, giving me complete access to my media library in the den.Once connected to your home network, the Boxee box can play pretty much any audio or video that's available.  It even displays your titles in a very user friendly way, showing the artwork for the movies as you browse through them.  It's like having your own little video streaming service locally.  The Boxee also plays mp3, ogg and FLAC aucio files (among others) so you can use it to stream your favorite music as well.As someone who watches a lot of streaming video programs, the Boxee shines there as well.  I love the picture quality and easy of use watching things like Amazon Prime Videos, Netflix or even the shows on Revision3 and the TWiT network.  Don't worry if you've never heard of the last two, they're both tech networks so check them out if you're into that kind of thing.  You can also stream content from YouTube and pay services like the MLB.tv package.  I have to say, when it comes to the MLB.tv interface I like the PS3 version better, but both play the games nicely.The best way I can explain the Boxee is a Roku on steroids.  The Roku doesn't do streaming of audio and video over your home network, which is a major downside to me.  The Roku is much easier to just hook it up and use, and it's the box that I would recommend to those with less than good tech know-how.  Anyone that can find their way around computer networks will find the Boxee to be a very powerful and fun device that can handle a lot more of your television viewing than you might think.

$REVIEW.: Purchased mine about 4 years or so ago and it's been going strong.  I use Windows Disk management to span the hard drives in this thing to one huge drive.  I do the same for the drives in my pc.  I use the probox basically as a huge external hard drive for my movies.  You can do this more efficiently with raid, but I would rather have a 1-1 copy backup.  I use freefilesync to sync my data every week or so.I have a gigabyte GA-890FXA-UD5 mobo with a built-in eSATA port (JMicron JMB362 chip) that supports portmultiplier.  I keep the probox fan on auto and it stay there.  Fire it up every week or so, sync my data, then I just shut down the pc and it turns off automatically.  Wonderful.  Now that I have a house I kind of wish I got the networked probox.1 minor gripe:  Wish the power plug plugged into the back.  It's on the side which prevents it from being flush with the wall.

$review_text.: I have been using this remote for my 5D for about three years now
 I greatly prefer it to my previous remote, which was an infrared release


 I had trouble sometimes if the sun was shining on the camera or if I went too far from the camera with the infrared remote

 The radio remote allows me to move much farther from the camera, and doesn't limit the lighting situations within which  I can use the remote.The directions that came with this remote three years ago were terrible

 If they have been overhauled since then, you're lucky, because I had to pretty much figure out how to work this thing entirely on my own
 Also, don't forget to turn off the receiver, or you'll wear down the battery, and it takes an odd battery size.

$review_text.: I usually only stick to Logitech products, but I wanted to make a change and was always curious about this whole &#34;Mechanical Keyboard&#34; thing, Since I am a very fast typist and use the computer all day long, I figured it would be a refreshing change.The result however was terrible. First off, Mechanical keyboard (or at least this one) is INCREDIBLY noisy. So forget about anyone else being around you while you type. It's much too irritating. Second, Because of the size of the keys and the amount of pressure required to make them work, they require much more energy to use, and so you will get tired more quickly using it.The design of the keyboard is also very luckluster. First off - there is only 1 USB port, where there can clearly be room for 3 or 4. Not only that, but instead of having just one USB connection that acts as a hub for everything, this thing will need 2 USBs to the back of your computer -AND will take a seperate microphone and headphones output (instead of just creating them via USB like any USB Sound interface).The layout of the keyboard is very bad, they placed a whole column of custom keys on the left of the keyboard but unfortunately I'm already use to every other keyboard in the world so I keep pushing those keys instead of the CTRL/SHIFT/CAPS LOCK/TAB (I'm use to reaching all the way to the left for them).The only good thing about this keyboard is the way it lights up. It's pretty nice and you can control the brightness, but you have to controll it manually , while my previous keyboard (Logitech K800) would turn on / off automatically when I put my fingers on it. Which is much classier. Not to mention, that other keyboard was cheaper.Definitely sending this back until they can make a FLAT mechanical keyboard that lights up when you put your fingers on it and only needs 1 USB port.

$REVIEW.: The headphones sound simply amazing


 I imagine there may be technically better sounding ear bud style headphones out there, but am not sure if a listener could really decipher better sound than what these produce
 I had 1st gotten the AKG 460 Qunicy Jones set and returned those within 2 days
 I have been through a few sets of the MDR EX 51s and MDR EX 71s
 I thought they sounded great
 Until ofcourse I figured Id give these a try

 I forgot these in the office last week and had to go back to the MDR EX 71s for a day

 Thats when it hit just how amazing these sound

 These have a wider dynamic range


 The bass in these is very refined

 The treble is not harsh
 Overall after listening to the MDR EX 71s for less than 15 mins, I felt the fatigue because I had just gotten used to the sound of the MDR EX 500

 And I really liked the MDR 71s until I head these.I have had these for less than a year

 Can't speak alot about durability

 They seem durable but not alot, after all they are kind of fragile and have to be handled with care and may be unable to take a lot of beating
 I was more focussed on sound and in that department am not sure how much better one can do.

$REVIEW.: I had a nice Harmon Kardon 2.1 that the sub gave out on so it was time to get a new sound system for my desktop computer.  The speakers provide clear and focused audio with plenty of power and headroom, though they speakers can be overdriven and distort at high volumes.  I listen primarily to music while I work and am very picky about musical quality. I wouldn't rely on this small package to fill a large room with music or watch an action movie with lots of explosions, but it's perfect for a mid-sized room.  One thing that stands out is how the &#34;center&#34; channel sounds travel depending on how the balance is set.  The speakers are about four feet apart on my desk, but the vocals seem to come directly from the center of my desk.  As I moved the balance setting, the focal point of the vocals moved.  The only negatives about this system is the woefully too short connecting cables for the satellite speakers, that it defaults to Bluetooth when the power is cycled and that most of the controls are on the back of the sub.  .  Because the speakers connect with RCA plugs, that means getting an RCA coupler to have the sub on the floor under my desk.  The price is very reasonable, though not cheap.  I clearly got what I paid for and more based on other speakers I've purchased. I can't speak about their reliability as I only got them yesterday.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  I would not hesitate to purchase another set or recommend them if they prove reliable.

$REVIEW.: I have a 28&#34; television on my screen porch that was just sitting there unused after the analog to digital debacle a few years ago
 I was devastated
 I had already discarded five smaller televisions by giving them to the Vietnam Vet pick up, along with a lot of other outdated computers and vcr's
 However, I was determined not to give up my beautiful pre big screen tv

 I was looking around Amazon for some viable solution for keeping my beloved tv, when I happened upon this digital converter box

 It's only $29.00, and coupled with an ota antenna, I now can pull in 60 stations
 Also, it allows me to plug in (through usb port) a portable hard drive, so I can watch downloaded movies, and even listen to digital music

 I can even program and record with this little gem
 I absolutely love this little device
 It literally saved my 28&#34; in television from the junk yard, or wherever old electronics are sent to die.

When I say it did not work, I mean it identified itself as a new external storage device, but then went through a 20 minute examination of itself, and then failed to open. The same happened when I hooked it up to another computer running XP. As proof that the problem was the AcomData enclosure and not my old hard drive, I then bought an I/O Magic USB 2.0 Enclosure, and THAT works like a charm.

Too bad the unit was replaced by a "Thinner" model with less features. I think the went for the teenage girl market and not the audiophile.  I love mine, I have two..8GB and 16GB.  Only complaint is that the variable speed playback seems to have quit on both units.  Firmware failure?? Cowan doesn't seem to be very interested in helping me fix the problem.  They are trying to make me believe it does not exist.  But the same phone Tech tried to make believe that the unit did not have variable speed playback.  I had to prove that it did at one time.

Does not have a shoulder stripe, so it is not easy to carry it around.
$SUMMARY.: Good video camera, great price/performance

$review_text.: I am simply ecstatic.I opened this the minute UPS delivered it without great expectations. The information given for this keyboard is straightforward. It doesn't impart any of the sizzle for this product, thus my lack of excitement.I long put off buying an iPad because I type 120 words a minute using the querty system and didn't want to go back to using thumbs and/or index finger pokes.Thus hope but only moderate expectations.No, I don't type quite as fast using this keyboard as I do on my PC (or my vintage typewriter, for that matter). But it beats hunt and peck by a long, long shot.I should have known Belkin (or some other brilliant company) would fill the gap for me.  Why didn't Apple do this?

$REVIEW.: When I got my D100, I bought it used, and it came with this equivalent hand grip

 When I upgraded to a D200, I initially thought I didn't need this handgrip..


but wow did I miss it.First, if you take portrait-oriented photos at all, this is a hand grip with a control dial and shutter button exactly where you expect them

 You can take portrait orientation without sticking your arm out like a chicken wing.Second, with the D200, even with the cool battery management capabilities, battery life seems shorter than the similar setup did on the D100..


probably because of the bigger screen, faster sustained picture rate, etc

 The ability to stick two batteries in this really extends battery life.Those two things combined make the investment in the D200 so much more useful.On the D100 version of this, the handset adds a small microphone so you can annotate individual photos

 I used that feature exactly once, when I wanted to figure out how it worked


 This handset does noe include that feature, and I'm thankful - this handset is *much* more inexpensive than the D100 handset, probably because of smart design decisions like this
 The courage to cut a feature rather than add more useless stuff is refreshing - and what earned this the last start to push it into the '5 star' category.

$REVIEW.: Not much else needs to be said.  3000+ reviewers agree that these are the best rechargeable NiMH batteries.  Get a good charger like theLa Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Chargerto keep your batteries in top shape and they will last a long time.I use my eneloops in power hungry external flashes and they do not fail me.  The eneloops give a quick recharge time and have plenty of capacity.  And due to the low discharge nature of the eneloops, I don't need to worry about checking charge levels if I haven't used them in a few weeks.  Just make sure to bring along a second set if you're going to really go flash happy.I mark my batteries with a sharpie pen so I can ensure that groups of batteries get same level of wear.  Perhaps this is not necessary, but it cannot hurt to keep them at the same wear level.

I haven't got any use from the pc sync, and the wire that comes with wasn't very useful. When it was brand new it worked much better, but after a few months it's started making a high pitch sound, like the capacitor is still charging. It runs through batteries fairly fast, but again, for 50 dollars I don't think you can find a better flash.

$review_text.: I wasnt sure if I should get this since my first Koss product was terrible. It was the cheapest Koss earbud, but they were terrible, even unbranded 3 or 4$ headphones give much better sound. But after I read the reviews for this one, I decided to give it a shot since they were quite cheap. They are really good. Now I know why Koss have such a big name. These are easily the best over the ear type headphones around, alteast within this price bracket. The sound is crisp, mids and highs are clear. Bass lacks punch, not ideal for hip hop or techno, but great for rock music. The headphones sit neatly over the ear. They are a bit bulky and the plastic clip seems slightly flimsy. But I've had it for a while and it hasnt broken yet, so maybe I am wrong. One thing though, these wont fit in jeans pockets, which I find quite annoying on several occasions, but otherwise these rock.

Remote control didn't work out if the box, so I had to read the manual. Walk your dog, or read a book at least for 20 minutes while the remote control discharges his korean discharges. This and the fact that remote control controls are counterintuitive is the reason the player didn't get 5 stars.The player DOES PLAY DVD+R & DVD DL+R, even though the manual explicitly say it wouldn't.

The sound quality of this Belkin is pretty good.  It ain't no CD but it ain't bad either. It is loud and pretty clean with my RIO S35 Sport. Sometimes it has static noise but it is not that bad.  I find that it is best to tune to a frequency with a weak station rather than a frequency with only static.  If it is a frequency with static, you will hear alot of noise.  If it is a frequency with a weak station, I guess the "modern" radio will lock on to the Belkin instead of the weak station.  I think this is up to your car radio. When I try it the first time, I can hear both the weak station and my music at the same time. And then all the sudden, the car radio just cut off the weak station and lock on to the Belkin. Pretty cool.

$review_text.: [edited 4/09/06 for some final thoughts]This review is based on over six months of daily use and two road trips through much of the western USA and Canada.First, this software with the Holux GPSlim 236 is what I should have bought. The Tomtom GPS receiver is pretty, but the necessity of switching it on each time you use it (rather than it coming on with external power) has made it a pain to own and I'm going to toss it in a drawer or donate it to a GPSless friend.I use a Dell Axim X51v, so performance is not an issue, even on thousand mile routes the initial route calculation only takes a few seconds.Installation. The installation was simple and trouble free. I had heard that getting the product registered might be an issue but as soon as I connected my PDA to the internet and entered the key I got authorized. I guess the individual state maps are on the rest of the CDs, I only needed the installation and the first two map CDs. For myself I'd rather this had been on a DVD. By comparison iGuidance Europe, which is on a DVD, took two trips to the Internet to search for help and quite a bit of messing with the Bluetooth connection before it could see the receiver.Connecting. If the application is started whilst Bluetooth is disabled on the PDA it simply enables it and connects. Other than waiting a few seconds there has never been an issue with the Bluetooth initerface. If you need to pair it the code is 0000. If you need to use a different GPS then tap the screen, hit "change preferences" then three right arrows and then "show GPS status". Hit the "Configure", use the arrows to select the right hardware and hit Select. Easy. In iGuidance I had to add the receiver as an 'outgoing' serial connection and then tell it which com port had been assigned.The hardware works reasonably well, the Bluetooth receiver has mostly locked on fast and stayed locked everywhere except inside tunnels and a ferry, and even there it managed to receive a couple of satellites (how?). Twice the lock on has taken more than ten minutes, I have no clue why, the satellite display showed around eight good signals but it just didn't lock on. A selling point of the hardware is that it shuts off if the Bluetooth link is down for more than a few minutes. That is sensible, no point running the battery down. But there's a down side, if you want to put the receiver somewhere where it can get a good signal, like on the rear parcel shelf and plugged into a power socket in the trunk, then you'd rather not have to climb in the back each time you get in the car to switch on the receiver. In the long run this may be a killer for me, units like the Holux GPSlim236 can be plugged in and forgotten, they can also take an external antenna which the Tomtom can't... though to be fair it shows no sign of needing it either, in the middle of the first floor of a 300' wide multi floor parking structure it still locked onto six satellites.The 3D and normal map displays are both useful, however the zoom controls only last a few seconds and then the map returns to showing only a small section of road ahead. The zoom seems to be controlled partially by proximity to your next turn and partly by local road details, so in urban areas you get about a quarter of a mile. Perhaps they did this for safety, but in that case they shouldn't have provided the controls. In cities this is ok but when you are driving around rural areas it doesn't let you see the area around you, so you can't see if your route is sensible. I have taken to using the browse map view and then moving it as I drive in rural areas. I should be able to zoom the display until it shows a level of detail that is useful to me and it should stay there. When zoomed out the map display does continue to show useful detail, iGuidance drops too many map features and if you are on small remote roads can leave you looking at a blank screen.There are many choices for map colors and it's easy to get day and night color schemes that give good contrast and visibility. You can also choose from several clear male and female voice options, in English these include US, English and Australian accents. Terminology tracks accent, so if you choose English English you get motorways instead of freeways; amusing but not a problem.The text at the bottom of the screen can show the next turn, speed, distance to go, current time, time to go and eta. The choices are configurable, but nothing like the twenty or thirty that Garmin allowed you to choose from six years ago. The text is very small, I have good eyes and I really have to look hard to see the figures. If I'm 400 miles from my next turn I need to know that a lot more than I need to know I'm going to be turning left when I get there. For this sort of price it should be possible to have more control of the information displayed. iGuidance shows even less information and gives you less control. But this is another case where Garmin had a better solution six years ago.Touching the lower right corner brings up the overview of the route, this should have pan/zoom controls and be in the day/night color scheme. For a trip of several hundred miles it's hardly possile to make out the route on the full VGA display of the X51v.The options for finding a destination are easy to use, the ones I have needed were address, city center, POI and point on map. The routing is also non-volatile, so you can stop for the night and resume in the morning.  One strange thing is that the previous destinations are stored per map, so if you route to a city on the major roads map and then switch to a more detailed map the destination isn't on the list of recent destinations. The unit exhibits a common problem to north american products, you can't route between countries, you can't ask for a route from Calgary Alberta to Salt Lake City Utah because there isn't a map that has both cities. If you want to route from Bute Montana to Idaho Falls Idaho you have to use the major roads map because the states are on different major maps, west and plains. Worth bearing in mind if you live on a border.Trip time predictions are very poor. For a trip from Alameda CA to Port Angeles WA the initial prediction was around 18 hours, which means they are using an average speed of around 50mph. That may be reasonable for I880 on a Monday at 9am but it's 50% out for I5 in northern california. The actual duration was about 14 hours including stops for food and fuel and a visit to Hertz in Portland, OR. On smaller roads the errors are much larger. For the Nephi UT to Tonopah, NV the predicted time was over eight hours and the actual trip time was just over four. On major rural roads in Canada with a 60mph limit the trip times appear to be based on a 30mph average.Routing is fast and the suggested route is certainly in the right direction, but there are issues related to poor choices of road speeds. The software works out the time taken for various routes based on the average speeds for those road classes, but the low freway and major road settings lead it to choose apparently shorter routes through urban areas, this means that it avoids fast roads like US101. In Calgary it routed my south for miles on city streets when I was only half a mile from Deerfoot Trail which is a 65mph road with no stop lights and ultimately becomes I15 at the border. There are also minor weirdnesses, on my daily commute I take I880 south from Oakland CA to San Jose CA, at I238 it directs me to take the off ramp, then then on ramp back to I880. Strangely, if you start from a different place it is able to route you straight down I880 without detouring to the off ramp. Mostly the routes aren't bad though, but Garmin did it better five years ago.Rerouting: If you ask for an alternate route it seeks an alternate for all of the route. So if you are going from Oakland, CA to Seattle, WA and get stuck in traffic trying to get to the freeway and ask for another route it will not only change the entrance onto the freeway, it will also reroute the rest of the trip, so instead of a long day on I5 you may find yourself on a three day drive up the coast. The simple solution is to divert until you are past the problem and then to resubmit the original destination.There are some major mapping errors, much of the time in Canada and Montana the mapped road position was tens or even hundreds of yards from the actual position. This causes the software to either show you driving through open fields near the road, or down the wrong side of a freeway, or even down the frontage road hundreds of yards away on the far side of the freeway in Banff national park. This causes some strange voice directions too, like "turn around when possible" when you are driving down I15 at 70mph and have been going the right way for hours and have to keep going straight ahead for hours. Most city streets in the US are spot on though. But the maps do seem to be 2-4 years out of date.POI problems. The POI list is very lacking. Maybe half to two thirds of gas stations are missing. But worse is the method of selecting POIs. You can look up stores by name, but in the case of the major chains you can get quite a few hits. In places like the San Francisco Bay Area there's a world of difference between somewhere 11 miles down I880 and ten miles across the bay, the first is a 22 mile round trip and the second could be 70. All you get is a list of stores with distances, no address, no direction. So you can't tell which 15 mile distant place they are in. If you select the wrong one and thereby discover that you need to drive thirty miles and cross a toll bridge to get there then there's no back button, you have to go through the whole POI selection process again. This is a method that is not yet ready for the real world. It took me a good ten minutes to discover that the POI list didn't know about the particular version of the store that I thought it should know, I guess I didn't really need it, but then I'm not always in my own back yard. Garmin gives the address and direction of POIs before you commit to one.The map accuracy and POI list needs a lot of work.Only the main map display follows the day/night color scheme, the route map and browsable maps remain in their standard eye wateringly bright colors. A brightness control would be more useful than night colors, but to get to that you have to go to the PDA settings, not something I feel like doing whilst driving.At the end of November '05 Tomtom released Navigator version 5.21 for Windows Mobile 5. The behavior of the system has certainly changed. The most noticeable thing is that it now strongly prefers the shortest route in many situations. Unfortunately that means that it will now route me on surface streets rather than the adjacent interstate. For example Alameda to Emeryville can be achieved almost exclusively at 60mph+ on I880, I980, I580 and I80 and yet the new version chooses the surface streets at 25mph with lights every block. I suppose it can't be expected to know that the route it chooses goes through West Oakland which has more murders than most European countries. In the Mojave and Death Valley it often routed me down dirt roads when there was a decent highway nearby. Whether it's the map data or the routing, they need to know that a trail formed by a bulldozer driving through the desert isn't the same thing as a metaled road.I have contacted Tomtom customer support about the ludicrous average speeds, however they have not contacted me in a month, much less the 24 hours they promissed. Neither Tomtom not Teleatlas have given any sort of response to my eight map error reports, if I am going to all that trouble to accurately describe their errors the least they can do is acknowledge that they have received them, right now I don't know if they are dropping them in the round filling cabinet.After more research I have found many reports of Tele-Atlas inaccuracies (in the UK, for example, major towns missing and impossible directions at some of the bussiest interchanges in the country, like the M4-M25 near Heathrow airport, which may well be the first interchange many foreigners meet in the UK) and even major cities missing from the database.Compared to iNavigator 2.1.2 Europe: Tomtom update rates are faster, the maps are drawn better, the voice prompts are timed and spaced better. Tomtom shows more useful data than iNavigator, though still not near the standard of old Garmin dedicated units.  iNavigator Europe has some serious usability issues related to windows-style menus covering up essential controls like the map zoom and exit buttons. The zoom control on iNavigator is persistant, but not available as often and is very difficult to use whilst driving (on Tomtom the top corners zoom out and in, on iNavigator it's a tiny little control at the bottom center).  It may not be fair to compare the US Tomtom (Teleatlas) maps to the European iNavigator (Navtech) maps, but they are about comparable. Both have their issues but will still get you there in the end.On balance still a good product, however I am becoming concerned that the hype of the advertising campaigns isn't matched by world class technical teams. It took more than a month to answer the first support question with "sorry, no". But to be fair, most of it works well. And it is very pretty. Overall I haven't seen a better solution.Around two months after I asked some fairly pointed questions, on their web site, I just received three emails saying that I must update my questions to indicate that I still required support or they would close them if I did not respond in 48 hours. So I did. In each case I commented "yes I still want you to answer my question". That's an interesting technique for clearing your tech support backlog, but it does nothing for your customers. I'm starting to think that all they want is your money and they don't care whether they, or their product, does a good job.Despite my response they closed the calls 48 hours later. Not good.I did finally get some answers from support. You can buy the European maps on-line for a very reasonable price. They don't have any solution for the GPS receiver powering off when it loses bluetooth comms and they don't see it as an issue.I'm looking forward to a software upgrade which I hear should come out soon. I'll update this review when it does.

I only mention it because, when seated, it can get caught on a plethora of things but I just tuck the excess into my shirt pocket.  Great lil headphones!

$REVIEW.: First I'd like to say that I use this mostly as an ipod dock/stereo, as opposed to an alarm clock, although it can be used as that. For the price, the sound is very good, and that's why I can confidently use this as a standalone stereo as opposed to just a measly alarm clock. At the same time, if you're very particular about sound quality, I will say that the base isn't terribly strong, but at this price point and style, I think that's to be expected. It comes with numerous adapters so that it can fit basically any kind of ipod/iphone, although it will not dock another kind of mp3 player.  One caveat I found with this is that the remote doesn't reach very far, maybe only about 15 feet and then it will not respond to the stereo. So, if this stereo is in the living room and you're in say.. the kitchen, forget about being able to change the song. This is kind of bothersome, but at the same time I'm not too surprised when dealing with one of these "mini-remotes" as I call them. All in all, I highly recommend this ipod/iphone dock and think it's a great buy. It's very attractive and I've gotten numerous compliments on it.

It works well and I was even able to disable the constant beeping it does when the power goes out using their Windows software (their Mac software does not allow you make that change which is unfortunate though).My only complaint about this unit is that it is not totally silent

$review_text.: The title of this review pretty much says it all. This hard drive is quite tiny. To get a sense for how small this is, imagine taking a deck of cards, dividing it into two piles, and placing the piles right next to each other side to side. This hard drive is slightly smaller than that. It receives all its power over USB; no separate power supply is needed.The drive can transfer data at pretty high speeds. I compared it to a full-size LaCie external drive, copying a large (20 GB) file from my MacBook Pro. This Seagate drive completed the task in just under 19 minutes, which was about 30 seconds faster than the LaCie drive.The drive comes with a couple of marketing videos preinstalled. It also comes with a Mac installer for a custom driver and some software that is supposed to help you back up photos and other things. Since the drive works fine on its own without a custom driver, I decided not to install that just in case it would make my OS slower or more crash-prone. Unfortunately I was not able to get the backup application to work without installing the extra driver. I trust Time Machine will do a better job backing up my data than the Seagate software ever would, so I don't consider the application's failure to be a big deal. I ended up deleting most of the stuff that came on the drive; it just isn't necessary to keep around Windows installers or videos in a half dozen different languages.The one small complaint I have is that the included cable is only about 18 inches long. That can be fine if your main concern is portability, but I would find a longer cable more useful for times when there's no good place to set the drive within an 18 inch radius of my laptop's USB port.The one big unknown at this point is how durable this drive will be. My data seems to copy back and forth just fine when it's new, but what about if it's carried around in a backpack every day for a year or two? How well will it hold up in those conditions? I trust Seagate probably tested such scenarios, but rotating discs have a history of failing when they're jostled just a bit too hard.

$REVIEW.: This has about the same footprint as my iPhone.  It's about a fraction of it's weight.  Build quality is excellent.  The speaker contains a rechargeable battery and there is a clear indication of when it needs to be charged and when the charging has been completed.  More on the charger and that "clear indication" in a bit.Pairing with my iPhone was immediate right out of the box.  I turned on the speaker, went to the bluetooth discover screen on my phone, it picked up the unpaired device, I entered the super-secret code number (0000), and it was done.Sound quality is good (for this type of speaker).  The sound is clear, there is very little (but at least some) bass, and it doesn't sound tinny.  I bought it for playing background music on the deck and it's certainly clear enough and there's definitely enough volume for that.The description implied and it should be clearly stated that in addition to working as a speaker this also works as a speaker phone and can also pass voice commands to the phone.  In fact it works just like the Motorola S9 headset except that forward and reverse don't seem to work with my iPhone4 (and it's much more difficult to wear as a headset).Now for the stupid decisions:There's a very bright and annoying light that insists on flashing when music is playing. According to the (well written) manual it means there's either a call or music on standby.  Near as I can tell there isn't.The AC charger is universal (at one end); it accepts 100-240V at 50/Hz.  It's the other end that I have issues with.  For some reason Motorola chose to use a micro-USB connector which is far from universal.  Even though it supplies 5VDC just like any other USB power supply if you lose theirs then you're out of luck.  (OK, I realize that this speaker was designed to accompany the Motorola E8 phone and that device used the same micro-USB connector.  Frankly, if I was reviewing that phone I would have the same complaint.)The less than universal foolishness doesn't end with the AC supply.  Since the connector is less than standard you need to get a special cable if you want to, say, not bother with a special charger and use your laptop to charge the speakers.  Guess what isn't included...Minor annoyances aside, this speaker is a good value.  You can share music from your mobile device at good volume and reasonable fidelity while keeping said mobile device on your person.  I haven't tried the wired connection and frankly if I was looking for that kind of speaker I'm sure there are plenty available that would cost less while providing the same sound quality.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.

$review_text.: I have three of these Probox 8 Bay Enclosures.  I bought one in 2011, one in 2012, and one February this year.  They are connected to three separate computers.  Two of them are on USB 3.0, and third on eSATA, and they all are directly connected to the motherboards.  The two USB cases are used one for games, and the other for movies, the eSATA is used strictly for my miscellaneous storage machine.  All three computers use a Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD5 motherboards with an AMD  FX-8350  CPU and 16gb memory.  Each Probox 8 Bay Enclosure has 8 x 2TB Western Digital drives of various models.  I have mixed WD 2TB hard drive models, (red, blue, green and black labels).  The 5400 rpm drives works right along the 7200 rpm in the same enclosure.  I guess I am like "the guy who buys a new car every time the ash tray is full".  Some day I will be bold and daring and start learning how delete and format drives...lol.I can access all three Proboxes through the network via the computers and a network router.  I was impressed that the BIOS recognizes them on boot up.  I like to mess around with different OS's.  I am able to boot up various Windows OS (NT, 2000, 2003, XP, 7, and 8) and LYNUX  from hard drives within the enclosures.  I can access all the drives though the motherboard boot up menu which is separate from the BIOS menu  The sleep modes of the enclosures work great (never shut them off), and auto fan controls are always working.  I must say that the one I bought in 2011 works just as good as the one I bought in February of this year.  I do like the "tray less drive bays easy for swapping drives.  My cases are very quite.  I recommend the Mediasonic H82-SU3S2 ProBox 8 Bay External Hard Drive Enclosure. I hope this was of some help to you.

$REVIEW.: I'm a professional photographer and I've owned this lens on three separate occasions over the past 8 years

 I've bought and sold a lot of gear and am very familiar with Canon 50mm lenses
 In addition to this lens, I've also owned the Canon 50/1.4 and currently own the Canon 50/1.2 L.I can confidently say this lens produced image quality that rival lenses costing many hundreds, upwards of a thousand dollars

 You won't find any full frame zoom lens under $1000 with this level of image quality

 Moving away from the 50mm focal length, you won't even find a prime this good for under $400

 This lens is so far ahead of others on the price to performance scale it's not even funny
 Third party manufacturers won't even attempt a 50mm F1.8 because there is no way they can do better than this lens at this price point.So for the position it occupies in the cheap prime category, the Canon 50/1.8 stands alone and nothing else comes close.So, what is it good at?  The benefits are many, I'll try to keep it concise.- It's small and light


 Smaller and lighter, in fact, than nearly all cruddy "kit" lenses which come with cameras.- It's cheap

 Compared to other camera lenses, it's a terrific value.- It's very sharp
 At F1.8 it's usable and has nice bokeh


 Pushed down to F2.8 the bokeh weakens, but the optics become super sharp.- It has great color, contrast, and saturation


 This will be the first taste of prime optics for many of you considering this lens

 The look, rendering, and "feel" of the images from this lens is addicting and very unique compared to that of a kit lens
 This lens really unleashes the true potential image quality of your DSLR.Why would you eventually sell this lens?- Build quality is "lightweight" to put it mildly
 The body and mount is 100% plastic


 It's not even the high quality plastic used on other lenses, it's the plastic you might find on a "made in china" toy that costs $15

 This is generally not a deal breaker though since the lens is so light


 Over the years I never managed to break mine, though the build isn't particularly inspiring.-  It's "only" F1.8

The 50/1.4 lenses take in more light and have better bokeh.- The 50/1.4 lenses are typically a little sharper at large apertures
 At smaller apertures it's a tie.So in summary I find this lens to be a good fit for beginners and novices to get a sample of prime image quality without breaking the bank

 The focal length makes for a splendid portrait lens on both a full frame and crop camera
 The performance is all around very good and the price absolutely cannot be beat.

It arrived and was very, very easy to install.  everything you could possible need came with the sound bar, no matter how new or old your tv is--or at least your flat screen tv.it took less than 15 minutes to unpack and set up.  After turning on the tv and sound bar, the results were phenomenal. the added depth when streaming video was really great.  the only caution i would make is to warn you that most tv shows and films seem to boost the bass so much that you need to adjust the subwoofer to reflect that--unless you want to be overwhelmed by bass.  like everything else connected with the product, it was so easy to do that you don't even have to find a teenager to do it for you.

She is an animation design major and needed a reliable external storage device for all her animation projects. The WD 'My Passport' is perfect. The lightweight and sturdy design makes it easy to transport to the various computer labs on campus - without having to lug the laptop and accessory backpack everywhere. She takes the 'My Passport' to the computer lab and simply plugs into a computer's usb port and she is ready to work. When the day is over - back at the dorm room, all the files are simply copied to the laptop. The 1 TB is more disk space then needed for the whole 4 year program!

$REVIEW.: I've been looking for a soft case for my little Coolpix, so when Vine offered this case, I gladly took it
 Here's my take on the AmazonBasics Camera Case:PROS:1
Very soft


 While a hard case offers great protection, it can be uncomfortable to carry around

 This case is comfortable to carry on your belt or on a clip while keeping dirt and scratches away from your camera.2

 Flexible

 This case not only fits my Coolpix but my slightly larger Canon as well.3
 Big pockets for my extra memory and batteries
 The lack of space for necessary accessories has been my big complaint about my other camera cases, but now I can carry it all in one package, one behind the main space, another on the outside.4


 Multiple ways to attach the case
 Slide it on a belt or use the metal ring to secure it to on a clip.CONS:1


 If I were to request one additional feature, it would be extra padding on the folding top
 The body of the case is nicely padded but the top is a bit thin for my taste.All in all, I'd recommend this case to anyone who wants to carry and protect their small digital camera

 It solves problems other cases don't.Four and 1/2 stars!

$review_text.: I ordered this tv to replace a 20 year old one that I was playing xbox on. I love it not just for the gaming but the other features also. the sd card reader and the ipod dock are a great couple of add ons for a tv. its very easy to use and the menus are very user friendly. I ordered it from abt electronics and received it in 4 days. The picture is excellent. I just had to tone down the picture a little while gaming cause it was a little too sharp. but the adjustments were easy to do. I recommend it to anyone.
$SUMMARY.: Well worth the price, Nice features.

$REVIEW.: In general, Amazon Basics has really done a nice job of putting together quality accessories, nicely packaged, and this charger set is no exception.This package comes with a travel bag, a car charger, a wall charger, a usb-iPhone cable, and adaptors for the wall charger to allow it to work internationally. It worked great with our iPod touch and iPhone 4S. I like that the car charger and wall charger have usb outlets, so that I can use them to charge other usb devices like my earpiece once my phone has a charge. Also, the blue leds on the chargers are a nice design touch and give the devices an apple compatible feel.The only thing to remember is that this is a little bit too much kit for someone who is staying in one country -- you can get quality products that are cheaper and smaller if you don't need the ability to plug them in in Istanbul one day, Great Falls the next.

$review_text.: The only reason I didn't give five stars, it appears the magnet that turns off the ipad is small and if the cover isn't aligned perfect when you close it, the ipad doesn't sleep and also if it slips, it will wake up. If it had a longer magnet strip this wouldn't happen.Outside that, the construction is outstanding. Nice texture, easy and comfortable to hold. Nice stitching on the edges. Isn't too large or bulky and appears it would be quite protective in a drop.One other thing that would make it perfect is if the place you hook the cover under on the back to use the flip stand had some sort of velcro. I have noticed that when you prop it up to type, if you push a bit too hard, the cover slips out of the slot and the ipad falls flat. Small issue though.All the holes line up as they should which is nice as well. (camera, plug, speakers ect)I would definately buy another one, especially if they made a couple of small changes mentioned above.

$review_text.: Because the tester can not test a PSU under a load, this is just about useless

I have two PSU's that I know for a fact are bad however, this tester showed all lights needed for a &#34;good&#34; power supply.This tool should only be used if the computer does not turn on at all (when hooked up to the motherboard) to test the if it is giving any power at all
Of course any computer builder should be able to troubleshoot that issue without this tool completely


If you are getting random restarts to your computer and use this tester on the PSU more then likely it will say its fine.I gave it one star do to the very cheap price and the very limited use it may give me someday, but I doubt I will ever use it again.


$SUMMARY.: Tested two bad PSU's as OK

$REVIEW.: These are extremely simple to set up and work very well.  You simply plug the devices into power outlets, set up a few settings in the software, and you are ready to go.  You can set this up with a hard line going to the or by connecting to a wireless network, so you have a lot of flexibility.  I highly recommend a physical connection to the device, as you will get a more stable and faster connection.  You can also set the devices up with WPS, making setup a lot easier by simply pressing the WPS button on the device and connected devices.The 200mbps rate is a BEST CASE scenario and you will not get this throughput as a rule.  There is another version that supports up to 500mbps which would be much better for HD streaming or things of that nature.  With this said, these work far better than similar devices I used years ago, so don't worry.Do not connect the devices to a power conditioner, as these devices can filter the internet signal out as noise.  Connect directly to your outlets and you should have no problems at all.

Searching on the internet I can find no solutions to the problem.Other than that it works great
A major feature is that it will pair with as many as 6 devices and easily switch between them.If it had worked on my Blackberry I would have ordered another one so I wouldn't have to carry one between work and home.Well worth the money.PS - I bought this through OutletPC

$REVIEW.: With "MyVolume" connected between my Dish receiver (VIP 722k) and my Sharp TV (LC-42D62U), the unit acted just the opposite from it's intended purpose.  With a quiet movie on it would swing the volume from too quiet to hear to so loud everyone in the house could hear.  The swing would happen every minute or two and I would have to ride the volume button almost continuously.  I had to remove it within the hour.  Tried plugging it in again later and had everything powered off.  When it all came up the result was the same.I contacted SRS Labs by their "contact us" web page email outlining the problem and asking for help.  Since they haven't responded I can only assume they aren't interested.  I returned it for refund.  No replacement wanted for this product.

I have been using the Galaxy Tab 10.1 for a month now, and I still find myself amazed by how good it is


In the last month the only reason my laptop has been turned on recently is to access the 600+GB of media i have accumulated over the yearsI am not aware of any tablet that is technically superior.As far as Android is concerned, its a good OS and it does everything I could possibly want


Only drawback is the range of compatible apps, but i have not had any trouble finding an app that matches what I want
And anyway the count of apps is increasing daily.

$REVIEW.: I own several zipper cases for tablets and this one is the nicest that I have seen or used


It is available in both Black/Gray, Black/Blue and Black/Pink colors to suit your style
It is well made and provides excellent protection for your 7 inch tablet

I have attached a video to show you its benefits and functionality


What I liked about the case is:* It is well made and protects your tablet in a very good manner.* It is attractive and available in several colors.* It not only acts as a case but as a stand to hold your tablet in the landscape and portrait viewing modes.* The inside of the case has an excellent design of neoprene bumps to provide extra cushioning for your tablet


(Very good concept and design)* The stitching and material quality is very good.* The outside material provides a nice grip and is thick to provide scratch, bump and drop protection for your electronic device.* The case has a nice strong double zipper design to hold it closed.* There is an outside pocket for your accessory charging cable, stylus, earbuds or smart phone.* The neoprene case exterior is water resistant.The construction and functionality of the case was top notch and it is probably the best zipper case I have seen for providing adequate protection and cushion for your tablet


I recommend this case to you as a top quality product


I rate it as a 5 star product!I was given a sample of this product for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review


$review_summary.: This is one of the nicest zipper tablet cases I have seen!

No backlash in the tuner wheel makes it easier to fine-tune stations.  Check.  Pulls in AM better than average.  Check.  FM sounds clear (Mono only).  Check.  Plays a long time on a pair of AA batteries.  Check.  Telescoping antenna for FM.  Check.  Has a good, quality feel to it.

$review_text.: As a keyboard this one in average and ok for usability of the standard keys. If all you care about is a BT keyboard and mouse to do the basics it's ok. It does the job.But it comes with extra bells and whistles that can be useful if you know how to use them.My 3-star rating is for a couple flaws that require this to go thru another redesign.1. The legs that swivel out from the near the back corners are flimsy and the weakest link on this design. I had my first keyboard all of a few days and one of the legs broke off. Today someone else in the office with this exact same model of keyboard had one of their legs break off.  I am sure that others will experience the same unless you either don't swivel them out (have the keyboard lay flat on the surface) or baby care for this fragile design of the legs.2. The keyboard has a LCD of sorts display. It is pathetic.a. It is so dim you can hardly read it.b. Trying to figure out how to set the date/time is a royal pain, at least for me. I am running Linux Mint 14 and a VMWare Workstation v8 with Win 7. Prior to running that setup I had just Win 7 running as my OS. I got the keyboard date/time set after some pain. It continued to work after I got a new workstation and configured as first described, with Linux and Win 7 in a VM. Then one day the batteries needed replacing. I changed them and the date/time now need reseting. I can not get it to set. They have a menu for the display but no mention of date/time is mentioned anywhere. I had to go to their website Support and find an article on how to set the date/time. It involves installing SetPoint. I did that and it has no mention of date/time either. The instructions say it will just automatically set. Wrong, not for me. I restarted Win 7. I restarted the VM. Nothing makes a difference. Why Logitech couldn't just offer an option in the provided keyboard menu to Set Date/Time and let you type it in and Apply is beyond me. They obviously want to sync it to the system clock but that isn't automatically working either.c. I find the display useless to me.

$REVIEW.: First, this really is an Amazon verified purchase; my husband paid for it through his separate Amazon account (it was a guy thing).  If you are considering purchasing a blu-ray player, this one is a screaming deal.  A few months ago we bought the identical player at Costco for two hundred dollars.  This one was just under one-hundred twenty-six dollars, or a saving of about 37 percent.  Installation couldn't be simpler; all you need is one HDMI connector.The picture clarity is outstanding, and you will even get a better picture on regular DVDs than before  because this player has an "up conversion" feature.  If you have a home network as we do, the player wirelessly connects to the internet, meaning you can download movies, notably from Amazon, which now has a service.  This player loads all DVDs, including blu-rays, very quickly, i.e., in seconds.  Delivery was prompt, and everything was intact.May 28, 2014 update:  We have had no problems whatsoever with this player, which is great considering over time the discs can get stuck or there can be some other mechanical issue.

I see a lot of people are having issues and/or don't like it.

$review_text.: I just pruchased the Trio T 2800 and am very disapointed.My prevoius MP3 player was old technolgy (Sansa e250), but it was much better than newer devices.The Sansa e250 is easy to use, durable and has a very long battery life. I don't know how long you can go on a charge, because I never ran it down.This Trio T2800 feels flimsy. Other users have reported the display/control interface fractured easily. I believe it! I am afraid to push too hard on it, but it doesn't respond to a light touch, so you have to press on the screen harder than is reasonable.The controls are confusing. I'm still trying to figure out how to get it to play music in some order other than alphabetical by title. This is frustrating because I have many songs that have the same title, often the same song, performed by diffent artists. Also, many of the best music selections consist of movements with different subtitles. To play the movemebnts in alphabetic order is ridiculous and offensive to my ears.Another gripe is it's impossible to turn the volume up high enough to hear my music over ambient noises.I paid $30 for this. That's $25 too much. I passed by less expensive units because I liked the idea of touch screen.Bad decision.

$review_text.: The best thing about it is the price. I paid just over $75/used copy on amazon.com and for that price you get a very good lens BUT... although it's very sharp in the center throughout the range (f/1.7 to f/8), it did have very soft corner results from about f/1.7 to around f/2.8. I think the lens tack sharp "hot spot" range is at f/5.6 to f/8 ...giving that better balance of center and corner sharpness. I would say it's not really a "great" low light lens if you're looking for overall sharpness near the wide open range but good for portrait photography and for those on a budget. For me, it just leaves me feeling that I could just save the money for a more expensive, newer and better lens.

 Now using a LaCrosse charger BC1000 and most of the older batteries just would not refresh well enough

$REVIEW.: For its size, the Memorex Party cube does deliver a decent amount of sound


 I like the versatility of this little device
 About the size of a 6-pack beer cooler, this cube will play CD's, AM/FM Radio, and your iPod or iPhone music


 The handle makes it very portable and because of its size, this is the perfect device to bring to all of your outdoor festivities


 It can run from an AC outlet or from an internal rechargeable battery, which makes it very easy to use, and you do not have to worry about carrying or constantly changing batteries.This is the safest docking station I have seen/used

The inverted well really does keep the connection pins safe from the mishaps my daughter experienced with her top dock

I now use it as my primary iPod charging station
The downside of this dock is that you must finger scroll on the iPod to navigate--there are no external controls on the dock.When not being used for outdoor activities, it looks tidy on the desk

I use it to play background music while I work on the computer


I am currently listening toBillie Holiday's Greatest Hitswhile I write this review


I prefer the softer music (sounds soothing) on the cube


 I can pump up theJeff Beck 3-Pak - Blow by Blow/Wired/There and BackandTexas Flood, but I would prefer my hardcore speakers for that

You can't pump this up to the loudest level without experiencing some distortion


 The music this cube puts out sounds clear and kosher--not exceptional, not ultra-powerful--after all, this isn't a Bose cube, but for the price, versatility, and convenience, the Memorex Party Cube sufficiently meets my expectations.Party time, excellent.Bohemian Rhapsody/These Are the Days of Our Lives

$REVIEW.: The Roadmate 5230T-LM is one of the newest GPS models that Magellan has to offer at the time of this writing. Although Magellan is the least popular of the big three GPS manufacturers with Tom-Tom and Garmin leading the way, let's see what it's got.Included in the box is the GPS itself, a suction cup windshield mount, a vehicle power cable that plugs into the lighter socket, and a USB cable for map updates and charging the battery off of a computer. It can also be charged off any standard USB charger like those used for a cell phone, so you don't need to leave a computer on. There is also a User Handbook, which just gives basic information to get you started.Although I know all of the manufacturers use the suction cup mounts for their GPS's, I dislike them. For some reason, they just seem to get in the way, are a pain to get off the window, and leave the tell-tale circle to let thieves know there could be a GPS in the vehicle. I prefer a non-slip dash mount instead, like this one:ME-USDM: i.Trek Universal Dashboard Mount with built-in holder for LG Nitro HD, Thrill 4G, Marquee, myTouch T, myTouch Ql, which I am going to order soon.This style of the GPS is quite nice, it feels slightly larger than a smart phone, and a little bit thicker. The case is made of black plastic, on the back is a small speaker, on the left side is the power outlet, and on the top right is the power switch. Besides the pinhole reset switch - that is the extent of connections on the unit. There is no audio out jack if you want to run it through you car's audio system. This unit does not have Bluetooth pairing, voice commands, or even an SD card slot for memory expansion.What is included with the Magellan Roadmate 5230T-LM is Lifetime Map Updates, and Lifetime Traffic Alerts. In order to get traffic alerts, the vehicle power cord must be plugged into the lighter/accessory socket in the car. I'm not sure if this is where the receiver is, or just the antenna, but be prepared to always use the cord when operating this unit. The battery does not last long, the manual indicates only 30 minutes when fully charged - and that takes about four hours.Before using the GPS, it is suggested to update the maps and firmware prior to using it. In order to do this, it is necessary to download the "Content Manager" software on a computer from the Magellan website. The software is available for both Mac and PC. The software installs quite easily, however when I connected the GPS to my MacBook Pro, The Content Manger failed to see the GPS which properly mounted on my desktop. Even switching USB ports did not help. The GPS mounted to the computer, but the software did not see it. I did not have a problem when mounting it to a PC. The Content Manger is an unimpressive piece of software with a clunky 90's style interface that does not have much to it. There is an address book interface that does not allow any sort of importing or exporting option to or from any address book or contacts software like Outlook, Windows Live, etc. You can only sync between the GPS and the Content Manager software. Any addresses need to be manually input from either device. So, if you already have a massive address book on your computer, you cannot use it. Basically, the only other thing that can be done on Content Manager with this model is update the maps, or buy additional Phantom Alert options. No Thank You. There are no celebrity voices, or different vehicles that you can download to the GPS, because there are no options to change them. Magellan allows limited customization to this unit. On the Roadmate 5230T-LM you are stuck with an arrow that represents your car, and a single female American voice to guide you (sorry no English accents available).The large five inch display on the GPS is quite sharp. It is bright, but like any backlit display it will bleach out a little in direct sunlight. What is nice is that my polarized sunglasses do not mosaic the display like the ATM at my local bank. Using the RoadMate 5230T-LM is pretty straight forward, and works any other GPS unit. To enter the destination, hit Menu, then address, type in the city, street address, then hit "Go!". The lady's voice will guide you along the way, just be sure not be blasting your car stereo, the small speaker has its limitations, but it is clear, and the volume level is acceptable. Directions will be displayed at the top, while the ETA will be displayed in the bottom left corner, if this tapped, a window pops up showing the distance, direction, speed, and time remaining. This window only lasts for about ten seconds. The touch screen is typical for a GPS unit, there is always a slight delay, and it needs a little bit of pressure, unlike a smartphone. It is more like a bank's ATM touchscreen.The One Touch feature is nice. It allows you to program in frequently used destination or search like if you want to know where a Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks is nearby. You can actually have a "Dunkin' Donuts" or "Starbucks" button on the One Touch display with the logo. Of course you can also program any address you would like, as well.I have not had any problems with the RoadMate's routing. Every time I have used it, it has taken me the route I would have taken myself. The Junction view is nice, it greys out the route you don't want to take, and shows arrows where you should be going. The traffic alerts pop up in time to change the route, however, I found the alternate routes a little hard to read, they needed to be in a larger, darker font. The traffic alert symbol is a red triangle on the bottom left of the map and has a time below it, though I have yet to find any documentation as to what the time actually means. Even on the website, I can't find this information.I have yet to hear the GPS use "Landmark Guidance" which tells you to "turn right at the Exxon Gas Station" instead of just turning right. I also have not seen the visual warning I have set for going 5mph over the posted speed limit, when travelling on the Garden State Parkway.I know all of the GPS makers have a problem with Points of Interest. Magellan is no exception. One example is when I looked up Grocery Stores near my house. It listed an "Edwards Super Food Store", which has been gone for at least ten years, replaced by a "Shopper's World", which is listed, however is not a supermarket. The unit incorrectly lists many other places such as "Harley Davidson & Buell of Edison" and "Supreme Manufacturing Co." as Grocery Stores? I don't think I will be going there for a gallon of milk! The obvious Shop-Rite, Pathmark, Stop & Shop and Acme in town are NOT listed under "Grocery Stores". If only Magellan provided a way for users to update their database.Overall, despite the RoadMate's  5230T-LM's limitations, it is a pretty nice unit. It does not have the customization that other units have, and it seems kind of expensive for what you get compared to other ones with similar features. My advice would be to shop around and compare all of the newest units out there first.

$review_text.: Use of [...] alerted us to an Amazon Deal of the Day price of less than $170.00.  Allowing that the Roku stick is valued at $100.00, our investment in our projector was less than $70.00, plus tax.  Use of this web site will alert you to Amazon buys that are the most attractive to you.An economical roll-up screen was produced with white poster board.  Attaching picture hanging wire enabled us to hang our screen where a painting was usually displayed.An ecomical pair of computer speakers (Cyber Acoustics suggested) provided the audio enhancement needed.Remember to remove the protective cover on the end of the Roku stick before effecting the snug attachment to the projector.  Origination and use of our new Roku account was quick and easy.Because we primarily use our projector where access to AC is not a challenge, battery life is of no concern to us.Video quality is better than you would be led to believe by some reviews.  We most often produce about a 52&#34; (measured diagonally) projection and have been pleased with the image.  No the image is not 1080p or blu-ray, but is VHS comparable.Audio quality, like the original tablets, demands the use of headphones or speakers.  This is the primary feature 3M needs to improve.  We deducted one star for this Achilles' heel.The small and grossly inexpensive tripod should be a part of every order.  Care should be exercised when using as it tips easily.Because the tiny remote can be easily lost, special attention should be given to its safekeeping.Our projector provides entertainment everywhere from our patio to our motorhome.While improvements to this projector are inevitable, until that time it will provide us with many hours of enjoyment.

$REVIEW.: This is a really neat gadget (if you can call a bag a gadget)

I do a lot of sports photography, mostly football
I really don't change lenses all that much, mostly stick to a EF the 70-200mm f/2.8L zoom due to its high build quality, weatherproofing, clarity, and ability to stop fast action
But, the field is a LOT bigger than I can cover with just that lens alone even though I'm hanging out on the sidelines


While I'd love to solve the problem with a new EF 200-400mm f/4L, that beauty is way, way out of my price range (and high up on my "if I win the Lotto" list)


In the mean time I've been looking for a safe and efficient way of taking on and off my extenders to be sure that I can catch all the action


That's where this case comes in so handy; it's a great (and inexpensive) way of juggling extenders and lenses so that I can make fast changes without inadvertently dropping anything


A most excellent idea and very well executed

Bravo to Lowepro!

$review_text.: I would just like to say that I had these for about 1 month until this headset broke

When they worked, they were very charming and I really appreciated the rich sound
As another reviewer pointed out, these guyz are hot on the ears
I would probably only use this headset for the occasional game of counterstrike and wear some better quality headphones with more breating room for regular listening and gaming.The fantastic sound that these make in mind, my headphones broke remarkably easy


Personally, I am in my latter teens and I am pretty careful of my gaming equipment

I can imagine someone less careful than me having a far less time span of this headset.The cord is undeniably too small and thin, that is all there really is to say

I would invest in a higher quality Senn product because they make great sound.

$REVIEW.: The glass and coating on the filter is exceptional, very seriously looks as if there is nothing there at all until you catch a specular reflection.However, the outside of the case it came it was worn and dirty, and the inside was also dirty with particles in it


 There were numerous particles on the filter which I blew off


 For this price and reputation, I expect a pristine product, not something that looks like it was picked up off the ground from a machine shop
 The box was sealed and everything, so clearly there some quality control issues


 Just make sure you inspect the filter you get, if you can clean it, great, if not, don't fuss with it and just return it for a new one


 I also ordered a 52mm of the same filter and it came in pristine condition
 So who knows what happened.

$REVIEW.: I've used these phones for about a year now, mostly for hearing protection and music/radio while on my motorcycle.  Earlier this year I took a month-long motorcycle tour in Mexico during which I wore them every day, all day, usually just using them as earplugs.  They get top marks for comfort, and sound quality.  I'd definitely buy them again if need be.  Here's the warning: they come with a bad case.  The case puts a sharp bend in the headphone wire and the wire will break at that bend.  I managed to fix mine but I recommend you throw away the case and store the phones in a small bag or such.  There's also a second warning: you must use the little mylar covers that keep water and ear gunk out of the phones.  Shure sells spares when you're done with the dozen or so that come with the phones.Update after 2 years: I'm about ready to throw the phones away now.  First the wire broke near the left earpiece and I opened it up and fixed it and taped it shut.  Then the wire broke near the right earpiece and I did the same.  Now the wire's broken somewhere in the cord.  What it comes down to is, these are pretty delicate phones.  I still think they sound great and are very comfortable but I suggest you buy the extended warranty.

$REVIEW.: Well, after about a week of struggling with this and its sister PCI-E SATA III card, the SY-PEX40039, I decided to give up.Fundamentally, there is some sort of incompatibility with the ASUS Rampage III Gene motherboard in my computer, which has the Intel X58 chipset.My guess is that as this motherboard and the X58 chipset have transitional features, partly SATA II and partly SATA III, with the original X58 drivers unable to read 3 TB hard disc drives (they have to be updated to do 3 TB drives), that the incompatibility is either between the motherboard firmware, or the X58 chipset and this PCI-E card.I already had a 128GB SSD running on one of the two SATA III ports on this motherboard. I had filled up all eight ports on this motherboard with various DVD and Blu-ray drives and hard disk drives. I wanted to add one more hard disk drive to this system.I tried all sorts of configurations. Several BSOD's and other computer freezes later, I took the major step of re-loading Windows 7, which did finally sort of get it to work .... but any sort of configuration was fundamentally incapable of recognizing 3 simultaneous SATA III devices at the same time without wrecking the boot SSD.From the other reviews, it seems that this card will work with older systems that don't have any SATA III ports at all. I've installed PCI-E SATA II port expanders in an older computer before, and that went completely smoothly, and so I know this is something that should be possible.Does the blame belong all to this card? No, but since the manufacturer doesn't tell you which motherboards and chipsets that have PCI-E expansion slots work with these cards, and which do not, I think it deserves the one-star rating for wasting my time. And, if anybody has figured out how to get these things to work with the ASUS Rampage Gene III motherboard, please feel free to post into the comments section.

I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general

I know very little about smart phones or tablets

 I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned


I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes


 When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes

 Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support


 I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use
 The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation
This device runs Android 2.3


It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly

The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage


I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model
This is an important point in the reviews that follow


I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium

 Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet
It is HEAVY
While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps


Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet


 While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent

The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router


The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps

Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing

To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email

They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet

While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below
 At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model


SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection


The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly

Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet


 It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes


According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera


 A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera

 However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet

 I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it
SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark


I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb

I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app

The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes
Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet

At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card
I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees


Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs
Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you

Try each one at least briefly


 NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing


How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting
How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account
Type an email to someone

Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on


See how long the battery lasts.



$SUMMARY.: Wonderful Tablet if you do not need/want a larger screen!

$review_text.: I received my iPod classic as a gift.  This is my 5th iPod and I had high hopes.  After a few days my reaction is mixed.Sound Quality-) My 60 GB iPod with Video had much better sound quality than this version.  I listened to both with my Bose QC-3 headphones, a pair of Bose earbuds and a pair of regular earbuds.  I had someone hold the iPods out of sight so I coudln't tell which I was listening to during my "blind" test.  The sound quality on the new iPod Classic is a bit muddy.  That's the best description I can come up with for the sound.  It wasn't so bad the new iPod should be returned but there was a difference that I couldn't describe as a good thing.I could hear less of a difference in quality between the two devices on the standard iPod headphones.  Since my other headphones are both mady by Bose, it is possible that there is some problem with the Classic and those headphones.  I listened to both in my car, which also has Bose speakers.  The sound was different but not as different as it seemed via the headphones.  Nevertheless, try it (with your headphones) before you buy it.  Sound quality is very subjective and you may prefer the classic.Interface+) Cover Flow is really a nice feature.  It makes me stop and listen to albums that I had forgotten about over the years as they get burried among all of the newer music.  I have had no problems with freezing.+) The ability to search is a wonderful improvement.  I am not one of those people that knows every artist name, album name, or song name.  It's nice to search on one word.  The more ways the iPod can allow you to find what you want to hear the happier I am.-) The click wheel on this version seems less sensitive.  While it may give you more control, it isn't as smooth and easy-to-use as previous iPods.+) The finish on this iPod (silver) doesn't show every finger print the way my 60 GB black video did.  You'll still see every print on the back, but at least the front of the device isn't a mess the moment you pick it up.Display+) The display on this iPod is better than every other iPod I've owned.  It's beautiful to look at and movies and music videos look great!!All in all, I'm happy with the new iPod.  However, if it wasn't a gift I would return it.  There aren't enough improvements versus drawbacks for me to part with my 5th generation iPod.  If you need something new because of a break or this is your first iPod, it's fine.  If you have a working device that you love, don't rush out to buy this.****Update March 2008****The latest software update for the iPod (not iTunes) has really improved the sound quality.  I don't notice the difference between the two models any longer and I'm very happy with the Classic at this point.

$review_text.: Purchased a PN64D7000 plasma about 2 weeks ago. Break in time, run slides first, hrs. of some sort of prep, please. Picture is outstanding out of the box with a few personal tweaks, colors bright and warm, blacks are rich and depth of picture beautiful in 2d.  3d is otherworldly, I have viewed 3d blu rays with Sony 3d blu ray and 3d content on cable using Samsung active shutter glasses (2 came with Shrek package for free).  Based on the source, holy cow! Immersive, great color and accuracy, no halos, no blurring, awesome. Viewing distance of 3d from 12 feet to 20 feet and images still look good.Samsung 2d to 3d conversion actually helps old dvds look richer along with player upconversion.  Blu rays show greater depth but of course don't pop off screen. Effective 600 Mhz speed of plasma really just awesome when watching sports and action, again, no blurring.  TV is easy to set up, remote is average, built in wireless internet interface has great potential but the D7000 does not have a browser. Directs you to sites to rent video content, read USA Today, check Accuweather, or purchase apps, etc.  A browser is available on the D8000 with a qwerty keyboard built into the remote.  For another $300, that is my only regret so far. 4 hdmi inputs, a usb, pc and more. I don't really like the stand like another reviewer mentioned and will consider a future wall mount. For such a thin bezel the speakers are adequate but I almost always use my Denon receiver and it's 7.1 capable surround sound. This is a great tv.  All my friends and family love this plasma.Dennis R.

$REVIEW.: Great TV at a wonderful value. Picture quality is good but the real selling point is the built in wireless and internet apps. There are TON of video and music options most of which are free. A few minor glitches but for the price its excusable.  Only major fault I found was that  the ambient light sensor will interfere with the remote for your cable box.  Disabling the feature does NOT fix problem. There are a bunch of DIY suggestions online but I opted to download the application for my smartphone and use that instead of the standard remote

$REVIEW.: I love everything about this tablet except for 2 aspects:1

weight2
priceSince this is a company-provisioned device, I didn't have to suffer the price directly, but it reduces its market viability vs the iPad when it's priced too close to the iPad.Since I'm still reasonably healthy, I don't mind the weight so much except that it's not a great device for holding in bed for reading, or watching videos, or reading the news, or ...Other than those 2 aspects, this is a great tablet

I have both the iPad2 and the Xoom, and I have been using the Xoom for almost everything (the iPad for Netflix and software testing).Android got right:* notifications architecture* alternative markets (sp

Amazon)* voice available on the keyboard* multitasking* flash support* navigationMotorola got right:* very nice (acceptable quality) camera* battery life* very quick charge time* compassI use this tablet daily

And enjoy doing so.



$SUMMARY.: Great tablet, with 2 flaws - else would be clear winner

$REVIEW.: I have to give this one five stars.  I was hesitant to order due to low price, but the reviews were good.On it's arrival, i realized I would need additional cables, DUH!  I purchased and recommend these.  They are flexible, good quality and inexpensive, PLUS, they come with nice velcro straps, instead of twist ties, to keep neat cables.  3 for $5.99.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FX6ST8G/ref=cfb_at_prodpgInstallation:  This, I dreaded. Due to illness, I have been having a glitchy brain and was very concerned about this.PLUG AND PLAY ALL THE WAY!  I just plugged the HDMI going into my Blue-ray player into the Portia and then ran cables from my ancient Roku and Blue-ray to the Portia and It works. When the Blue-ray is on, it is on the TV, when it is off, the Roku shows and I have the cable going through the other HDMI on the TV.  No remote necessary. No power necessary. I had been worried about this, based on reviews, because my Roku is one of the oldest.It was so much easier and better quality than I imagined it could be.  (even my hubby can operate it LOL and that is saying a lot!)
$review_summary.: Wow!  Easy to install and works perfectly.
