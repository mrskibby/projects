The manual states that the solar panel is ONLY meant to extend the charge of a pre-charged battery. In other words, it cannot function as the primary mean through which you can recharge the battery.

It also requires a LOT of double-clicking.The streaming music is wonderful, since it doesn't require a computer; the slide show is a great feature, too, and both of these justify the price, but although the set-up is easy, the interface is simply not as elegant as an Apple and needlessly frustrating.I use this in my office and set it to play music all day. The sound system is fair-good, but it's not comparable to separate speakers; i.e., my Bose computer speakers are outstanding.The volume level is also lower than what I expected. It needs to be higher to rise above ambient room noise.Bottom line: Good if you don't have a \n",

Did try the iPad, but it did not do the job. Mostly the job of office applications, mail and calendaring did not work the way you need for business.

Even so I jailbroke the iPad, it did not solve the larger problem of having a lightweight machine, with touch; with all the business applications and the entertainment stuff I wanted.My second stop was an ASUS T101MT; the machine did a pretty decent job with everything for travel. Even so it took a lot of work to make the ATOM processors jive well. The touch and handwriting on the machine are great, but if you run a lot of applications sometimes a little sluggish to respond. However, for a little machine with keyboard for $449 on Amazon you cannot really complain. When this was announced at CES 2010, I was in line for one immediately. I was one of the first to pre-order and after waiting for 1 month I actually had my doubts if this will work out as they have release the machine without the very cool docking unit with keyboard they showed at CES 2010.

The best about the whole package, for you Apple fans who don't like the price, is a MS 6000 Bluetooth keyboard is included, so are a very nice leather case and frankly the design of the pad and size fits landscape exactly in my elbow for comfort. Handwriting is so good with the included stylus that I haven't even trained or transferred my handwriting data from the T101. Already made a trip with it and it is the best of both worlds. Basically you get a cross between a MacBook Air and an iPad. The battery life could be better, but with some configuring I got it to last 4 hours and that is pretty decent. Would I love 10 hours, sure, but at the end of the day you have to consider this.

Now this 720p HD wide screen cost us just over half of the original big screen tv. I hooked up an hd over the air antenna and the picture is fantastic.

The set with an upgrade dvd has a wonderful picture. I'm not sure why you'd pay more for a tv. Maybe you're a videophile. Maybe so.

This is my second MP3 player, the first being a cheap $20 Sandisk player, and I absolutely love the Sansa e280.  I have put almost 1,000 songs on the thing and it sorts by album title, artist, song title and so on.  For the price, you seem to get a lot of features and great functionality.  It is also very durable.  My wife wanted to help mow the lawn recently and she wanted to listen to music like I normally do so I let her use the Sansa and it fell out of her pocket and she ran over it with the riding lawn mower!  After searching for a while, I found it buried in the ground with tire tracks across the back of it.  Fearing the worst, I dug it out and it was still playing and didn't have a crack or anything on it.  It was just a little dirty, \n",

I've done this a couple of times and only knew it was on because I hit the volume button causing the screen to \"wake up\".- The volume control is kind of flimsy feeling and is very sensitive.  I've been listening with the player in my pocket and when I pull it out of my pocket, I almost always cause the volume to go up or down.

My first VX had severe backlight bleeding, and the replacement unit developed audio dropouts, so I decided that perhaps I should abandon that model altogether and upgrade to Vizio's 120Hz model.Straight out the box, this TV makes a powerful impression.  Its settings are nearly dead-on, but there are of course tweaks to be made.  I am still undecided in my opinion of the Smooth Motion feature; it is far too unstable to use for movies, but decent enough for sports games.  It essentially creates an extra 4 frames for every 1 frame of input, increasing framerates from \n",
            "24 frames/sec to 120 frames/sec.  During movies, this can lead to herky jerky movements in fast moving scenes, while at the same time create smooth as butter motion in slower scenes.  The effect is very similar to watching a soap opera, and I definitely prefer watching my movies at 24 frames/sec.There are many extra features built into the TV, but I find that the picture looks best and performs most reliably with them turned off, with the exception of Adaptive Luma.  Even without these features enabled, the picture is jaw-droppingly good.  Blacks are much more solid than earlier models, color accuracy is greater, and contrast is surprisingly good.The addition of an optical digital audio output is a very nice feature to have on a \"value minded\" TV as well.  This complements the gaming performance of this set nicely.  Both PC and current generation consoles look amazing on this TV, and you will not be disappointed if gaming is your main reason for purchasing.QAM tuning seems to be hit-or\n",
            "-miss, depending on your cabling.  The tuner had some issues pulling in channels when the coax run was longer than 25 feet, but that is the weakest feature I have found so far in the entire unit.The remote is a step backwards from the older units, in my opinion.  Far too flimsy and lightweight, it offers many choices for functions like PIP, but has no PC/RGB input button as the older remotes did.  That means switching to the PC input requires navigating a scrolling menu, something that is just downright ridiculous in this day and age of HTPCs.  Kind of a moot point, however, since most people have a nice universal remote anyways.In short, I think this TV is a great deal for the money.  You have to remember that this is Vizio's first foray into the world of 120Hz LCD sets, and they are nipping at the heels of Samsung and Sony, who are already on their second generations.Below I have provided the settings I have found to be the best for all around quality:Picture MenuPicture mode: MovieB\n",

It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to use it without reading the supplied manual.  I find the radio to be very sensitive on AM, FM and SW.  SW and AM are my main interests.  The tuning dial on the front of the radio allows me to move from channel to channel, and the direct keypad entry (key in the frequency then press AM) is like the Sony SW radios.  Another thing I like is the sound of the radio: you can select a narrow band for voice or a music setting that gives much better fidelity.

FM seems good/excellent.I've always believed that if the SONY 7600GR had a tuning dial that it would have just totally wiped out the competition.  The G6 comes very close and if it had synch detection, it would be a 120 percent winner.I suggest this radio as a very competent design, excellent RF performance, and a user interface that is excellent as well.\n",

            "$REVIEW.: There's been a plethora of reviews already, addressing specs and then comparing attributes, but I thought I've give a little perspective to those who shoot similar to me.On paper, let's be honest, the 5Dmk3 doesn't seem all that more impressive than theCanon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), and then compared to theNikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)- it looks like a perfect storm against the 5Dmk3.I typically used a pair of Canon 7D's (and sometimes a Canon XHA1 as an additional back-up against corrupt files on the 7D bodies before the 1.2.5 fi\n",
            "rmware update) to shoot video. Fine video, with a crop sensor (helped in recording speeches or wedding nuptials from the back of church, etc), didn't downconvert HDMI out to monitor to 480p like the 5Dmk2 when you pressed record. Of course there were the typical Canon SLR problems, the moire - aliasing, and the approximate 12-minute recording time limit. And of course, a 7D is only decent in low light.I recently needed to purchase some additional bodies, or camcorders, which would have:-longer record time than 12 minutes-be much better about moire - aliasing-be tapeless (I know, shame on me for being so late in making sure that even my backup is tapeless)-be better than decent in lowlight-beneficial if it could use EF lenses-would be nice if they could take good pictures (this last one was strictly because I take business pictures as a filler for cash from time to time and fill in as a second photo shooter in weddings when I'm not taking video)I used a 5Dmk2 on shoots from time to time\n",
            ", but had not owned one. I thought about going thePanasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black)along with a 5Dmk2, since it seemed the differences between the mk2 and mk3 were not so great, but there was enough of a price difference to make me wonder what the big deal was.But I was also really impressed with Black Magic Design's Cinema Camera from this year's NAB show, which could be purchased with an EF mount. However, it wouldn't be released until the end of July, and I needed to purchase before June.I settled on the 5Dmk3 over the 5Dmk2+Panasonic GH2 option and the Nikon d800 option.And I'm very glad that I did.Pros:+30 minute record time (well, 29:29 - for tariff purposes, if you don't already know why the strange record limit)+Fixed moire - aliasing issue (Well, made it much better. It can still show up in certain angles with certain patterns, but I see it maybe once a wedding shoot)+cl\n",

(I recommend a d800 if you are always in a studio setting, but if you do more event or run-and-gun style shooting, the ISO range is a must)-Dynamic range doesn't seem to be as good as d800, but once again, shoot with a neutral profile, or Technicolor Cinestyle profile, and fix in post-Initial price-30 minute record time (I put it in the cons as well because some events may need continuous shooting of 30 minutes or more)-On board sound recording (I put this here because it'\n",

Same with any SLR body, though.)To be honest, the 5Dmk3 fixes so many headaches that I was having using the 7D as my main video choice, headaches that would not have been resolved with just the 5Dmk2. The d800, which takes beautiful pictures, is a fantastic camera except in one very crucial area, lowlight. Even though it starts out with a brighter image at its low ISO levels than the 5Dmk3, the noise is atrocious as you increase ISO, even with noise-reduction software. A beautiful love affair can be had with the d800, I will say definitely say. And to all the GH2 fanboys, there are so many good things about the GH2, but it really felt like a trade-off compared to the 7D. It's like those bodies, the 7D and GH2, complimented each other greatly in that where one was weak, the other fixed, but in turn was weak where the other was strong. (If that makes sense.)I purely wanted to upgrade to fix issues. \n",

To make more room, I chose to remove my 3.5\" floppy drive. Yes, I still had that in! Haha.What I did first was install this new 300 gb hard drive as the \"slave\" and the old one as the boot drive. I then turned on the pc, and installed Maxtor's own software cd. After installing the Maxtor software, I chose the option of copying (cloning) everything from my old hard drive into the new 300 gb Maxtor. After that was finished, the instructions tell you to shut down, and exchange (switch) the connectors & change pin configurations in the back of both hard drives.I\n",

            "nion will vary depending on your needs and expectations.  If we look at it purely from a technological achievement, the Eye-Fi gets 5 Stars.  It's amazing that an SD card no bigger than any standard SD card can communicate with a network using Wifi and instantly upload pictures onto your Computer or other networks (such as Smugmug, Flikr, Facebook, etc.)  There is definitely a WOW factor when you take a picture and it appears on your computer screen about 20 seconds later while connected to your Eye-Fi internet account.Eye-Fi Explorer comes with lots of snazzy features like geo-tagging (shows where your picture was taken through wifi triangulation) and hotspot access (discussed below)Here are the issues I found in using the Eye-Fi.1.  Since Eye-Fi uses your digital camera battery as its power source, it does drain your battery faster than if you use standard SD.  I don't have a good sense of how much power it uses.  But if you're traveling on vacation and try stretching your battery to\n",
            " a full day of use, the extra drain on your camera's battery may limit your shots in the latter part of the day.  So if you use Eye-Fi, definitely carry an extra battery with you.2. You can't directly change Eye-Fi settings with your camera.  You have to plug it in the USB port of your computer (using the supplied SD reader).  So if you need to change the settings to change the network (a likely scenario if you're on the road) or  password (also likely), you'll need a computer to change the settings.  For me this is the part that makes it less useful than what I had hoped.  If I need a computer to change the settings, I might as well bring the computer and load standard SD cards onto the computer (and wi-fi it from the computer to Home or Smugmug).Eye-Fi anticipates this issue and provides a solution that may be very workable for many or most people.  The Eye-Fi comes with hotspot access through Waypoint.  So you can upload transparently when at McDonalds or other Waypoint hot spots.  \n",
            "It can also use \"open\" wi-fi hotspots.  But nowadays most router setups require passwords to get on.  So it would be nice to be able to type in a password or select a wifi access point.  Perhaps in the near future cameras will include built in interface with Eye-fi that will allow the user to change settings directly from the camera...that's the obvious next step.  Although I have no inside information on this, my bet is that the Eye-Fi designers are probably working on this solution as we speak.Installation was easy enough, although my computer had to go searching for the driver of the included card reader.  It worked easily enough, but some people I know would get tripped up over something like that.

On my daily vanpool commutes, I attach them to either an iPod or an iTouch, primarily listening to language training rips (at 128 kps encoding).1. The noise canceling of the MDR-NC40 is not as good as on the Bose, as a qualitative side-by-side comparison.  That is to be expected, considering the respective costs between the two units.2. After about four hours on the plane, the MDR-NC40 headphones started giving me a pressure 'headache'.  They are not expandable to the point that they were comfortable wearing for that much of an extended time.  (I'm fairly large, 6'3\" tall, weighing right at 200 lbs. and wear a fairly large hat size, 7 1/2, I think.)  For 'normal' sized people, this may not be an issue.3.

I like how they fold up and store in a smaller pouch than the Bose.  +1 for the Sony on that account.5. Be wary, however, that the two-pin airplane adapter is easy to lose.  Not much holding it into it dedicate pouch inside the storage case.  Mine fell out tonight on the vanpool ride home, but luckily, I noticed that it was missing and found it on the floor of the van after everybody else had left.I gave it four stars for the price/performance, but had to detract one for being too tight on my head and causing discomfort.

The mouse is well designed and fits my hand nicely.I miss the scroll-ring on this trackball, although I will now be using both, this Trackman, and my Kensington Orbit with Scroll Ring (I returned Expert Mouse it was a piece of crap). But the awesome \"Cruise Up\" and \"Cruise Down\" features almost make up for it. It will take some getting used to however.The scroller is too far from the hand, since I use my index finger to maneuver the trackball. I made the two buttons above the left click to be cruise up/down as opposed to using the scroller. The scroller would be a lot better if it were smooth with ball-bearings. I like to \"flick\" the scroller to slide far up or down the page. Can't do that with this trackball.The trackball is a little heavier than Kensington's [Orbit with Scroll Ring] ball, since it is bigger. But the excellently-designed software makes up for this, as you can very finely tune how fast and far it moves.One of the best\n",
            " features of the software (the SetPoint software, downloadable from their website), is the Orientation control. When I first used this trackball, I noticed that moving around was crooked (like instead of moving vertically, moving at a slight angle). But the software is remarkably designed, allowing you to configure the exact angle you're holding the mouse so that when you move the cursor around it's not moving at a crooked angle. That is a real bonus for this mouse. The software developer really hit the mark developing the software.Another great software feature, is you can set the buttons to do absolutely anything you want, even press a key, open an application, or pop up the start menu. They even have lots of default options that are rather neat, and useful, such as copy, paste, and Document Flip, which I might not use but that's pretty nifty! The highly customizable button configuration ability is a real plus for this trackball.The resolution of this trackball is rather low, however\n",
            ". I would like at least double the resolution for what I paid. It's lower than most $20 travel mice you can get at the store. Not good for a $100 mouse. I find myself undershooting or overshooting even after finely tuning the mouse speed, and this is solely due to very low resolution movements (it's not wireless lag, as the receiver is inches away from the trackball).I believe this trackball was intended to be maneuvered with the middle finger, which would place your ring finger on the right-click and your index finger within closer reaching distance to the scroller. Unfortunately I have already developed very fine motor movements with my index finger - something that has taken years to gain such skill. Thus I have to use my index finger and this makes the buttons on top not placed very well.For gaming, though so very infrequently that I play games, I will be using the Kensington trackball over this Trackman. There are two reasons for this -1) The Trackman is rather low resolution, and\n",
            "2) Being wireless there will be micro-second lag which is bad for gaming and FPS. (However for regular use there is absolutely no mouse lag whatsoever and I'm not sure there really would be any lag during gaming since I have not tried it.)Really the Kensington Orbit With Scroll Ring would be perfect, if it had more than two buttons. There are benefits and detriments of both - The Kensington Orbit has the Scroll Ring which is great, and high resolution movement, but only two buttons; and scrolling is the detriment of the Optical Trackman as well as being lower resolution, but it has lots of highly-configurable buttons. Personally I will probably go back and forth between the two and keep them both since they both have their advantages. Plus wireless is a bit of an advantage in some scenarios (although wireless is useless for mobility like for a laptop, due to the large corded receiver).Overall it's a great device, the only real downsides are the large corded receiver and lack of scrolli\n",
            "ng convenience. That's why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.UPDATE: I just discovered the Switch Application feature! Wow this is so awesome! This is a Must-Have and I'm going to quickly get used to it! Normally I switch windows using Alt+Tab, which works great but sometimes I have so many windows open it can get confusing, because I have to always keep the last open app in my head so I know which app I'm switching to. However this gives a mac-like multiple windows display that is part of the software, and it's really awesome. Only downside is I want to make the lock button switch applications, but I have to settle for the down button below the scroller. Which is fine but I wanted to make that button Page Down. Well I just made the lock button be page down instead (Page Down is important because the scrolling is not very convenient, can't fling it down).Also the Keystroke assignment allows multiple button clicks (like you could do Ctrl+Alt+S, not that you would do that combination but y\n",

I have a dual monitor setup on a straight desk (vs a wrap-around).  Consequently the second monitor is getting out of reading range, especially on its far side.  This arm allows me to pull the monitor closer to me, creating the wrap-around effect, pushing it back when I am not using it.2. I have a several applications that have numerous toolbars and bottom panes, substantially shrinking the working window.  While this is not that much of a hassle while creating the first draft, during revisions I routinely find myself wasting lots of time managing which toolbars and panes are visible.  This arm allows me to pivot a wide-screen monitor into portrait mode (you also need to do a simple Control-Panel configuration change).  A window that is 78% taller (1920 vs 1080) overall can more than double the non-toolbar area inside such a w\n",

With this arm, I can raise and tilt the monitor to a position where I can easily read documents while standing.  OK, a few inches higher would be perfect, but this is much more than good enough (I am 5'10\").  It adjusts smoothly, both up-and-down (after simple adjustment of tension) and tilting.Stability: The base is _much_ larger than that of many competing products (see below) and this provides excellent gripping power on the desk and stability even at the extreme extensions of the arm.Construction: Very solidly built. Only exception is that plastic cover on the upper arm, although not fragile, seems like it would break if you gripped it hard in certain places.  Since most people will tend grab the monitor itself to reposition it, this is likely to be at worse a minor, avoidable inconvenience.  However, be aware if you are in the minority.Tension adjustment for arm: Easy and not overly sensitive.  I made the \n",
            "adjustments so that my monitor was not visibly moving immediately after I released it and that was good enough: 12 hours later the arm was in the same position (no creep).\"Cable management system\" is one of those examples of unnecessary marketing exaggerations: You can slide the cables into the plastic cover on the upper arm and then secure them with cable ties to the lower arm and post (two cable ties provided).  One illustration shows cables being routed through the holes in the lower arm, but those holes are too narrow for connectors for DVI, VGA or power to pass through (HDMI fits). The plastic cover on the upper arm seems designed to accommodate only two cables--power and video. They can be popped in simply by pressing on the seam in the middle of the cover.  However, a third cable can be inserted by starting it at one end and slipping the insertion point to the other.  What is the third cable? A USB cable for a webcam or built-in USB hub.  Or a second video cable so that the moni\n",
            "tor can be switched between two computers. If both video cables are HDMI, there is some room left but if they are the thicker DVI and VGA cables, there is very little room to spare.VESA-D mounts: The plate on the arm is 75mm and onto that you can screw a plate for a 100mm mount.  It seems like forever since I saw a 75mm mount and all the adapters I have seen recently have both 75mm and 100mm holes on the same plate, but apparently there are situations where such a dual-purpose plate would cause problems.Hardware: All the hardware was present and easily identified from the instructions.  The only tool not included was a Phillips-head screwdriver (for the VESA-D mount screws). Most of the screws needed Allen (hex) wrenches, which are supplied, but the instructions do _not_ specify the size to use.  This is not a problem during initial installation--because the choice of the provided wrenches is trivial--but could be an annoyance for some during de/re-installation when you have to find th\n",
            "e appropriate ones in your toolbox.Instructions: My evaluation unit came with photocopies stapled on the upper left corner, so they may not be the absolute final version. The instructions are overly terse and some of the drawings took some puzzling over to understand the intent.  For someone mechanically inclined, such as me, they are more than adequate because they serve only as a sanity check on what seems obvious.  However, based on experience helping people assemble similar items, these instructions may give them pause or worse (details follow).I installed the arm on the side of the desk (I don't have a grommet hole, which is an alternative).  To _fully_ slide the clamp over the desk requires roughly 3 inches of clearance under the desk, but my desk has only the common 2-inch clearance (to the support bar).  Since the underneath clamp plate was only 2 inches wide, I decided to install it where the post would be close to the monitor rather than having the arm extended from the back-\n",
            "-low vs high torque--even though the back provide the full 3-inch clearance.  With the 2-inch clearance, the clamp was absolutely stable--I suspect I could move the desk using the post as a handle.  I am a bit surprised that 3M doesn't include the clearance-needed in its product spec, and advice about positioning the post. So if you are recommending this to someone, pass on this additional info.Aside: The plate is 3 inches long, providing lots of surface in contact with the underneath of the desk. Notice that most of the foot (on top of the desk) is away from the edge (unlike some other models), and consequently a 1-inch gap does not significantly decrease its holding power.Comparative: The oblong clamp plate (underneath) is _much_ larger than the corresponding disks widely used on competing products.  And the \"feet\" on top create a _much_ larger base than most competing products, which often have bases that are only modestly larger than the post.My monitor is roughly 14 pounds (arm ra\n",
            "ted for 20) and it is more stable on the arm than on the stand it came with.I did need to make two adjustments, and they were easy but inadequately documented.  The first was one that virtually everyone will need to make: It is to increase the tension on the upper arm to correspond to the weight of my monitor (to keep it from drifting up or down).  The too-terse instructions don't tell you that you need to raise the arm to its upper position to get the access hole to line up with the adjustment screw (although this is hinted at in the drawing).  A mechanically inclined person will quickly figure this out, but others may give up after initially failing.Aside: This is actually good _design_ because you should be making this adjustment at the upper position because this is where the coiled spring that provides the least tension to support the monitor.The second was an adjustment that most won't need to make: The ring on the post was in the middle which wasted much of the vertical extensio\n",
            "n range: The bottom of my monitor could be extended to below the desktop (useless), but I couldn't raise it enough to comfortably read while standing (or be visible over my shoulder).  The adjustment itself was trivial--one screw using a provided Allen wrench--but it wasn't included in the instructions for this model, although it was if you looked at the instructions for a related model.  The adjustment screw wasn't readily identifiable as such--it could have been a rivet--until I inserted one of the provided Allen wrenches.  Note that if _you_ don't want to be able to raise the monitor high, you want to leave the ring position unchanged (because it puts less torque on the post and clamp).Details: I raised the ring to 2.75 inches from the top of the post, leaving 1 inch of post above the arm socket (for earthquake bounce).  This position allowed me to position the _middle_ of the monitor from roughly 7 inches above the desk through 20 inches above.The tension adjustment requires some t\n",
            "urning power and a large Allen wrench with a large T-handle is provided to make this easy.  Since there is no obvious place to store the wrench on the arm, you probably want to label it so that you remember its purpose.Portrait mode: Rotation is clock-wise and the stops are noticeably beyond horizontal and vertical, so if this friction fit (between plates) loosens with use, there could eventually be a problem. My suspicion is that this design is based on the expectation that most people will leave the monitor in either landscape or portrait mode and not be occasionally switching between the them.Time in use: 1 week, but the construction is so solid that I don't expect wear-and-tear problems for a long time (with landscape/portrait being the possible exception).\n",

They are decently comfortable, but the cup size is just slightly too small for my ears.  The range works really well for me, through walls and other things with lots of interference.Lots of people have reviewed these features and I find that I'm not going to add anything to them so I will start with what I find intensely annoying about these headphones.1)  No auto off/power-saving on the HEADPHONES.  That's right, you lay down the headphones one day and pick them up the next the headphones will be dead, hope you weren't planning on listening to them.  I'm unable to comprehend why Sennheiser thought lack of power save or auto off would be ok in a pair of battery operated headphones.  The headphones don't even eventually turn off when you turn off the base and there is absolutely no signal.2) Auto-off on the BASE.  You have to t\n",

If you put the headphones on the charger it will turn off the headphones which means the base will eventually power off.  It does not turn back on when you remove or turn on the headphones, you have to do that via a separate button on the base.  The only explanation I can come up with for this backwards design is that the engineer that was supposed to put the power-save feature in the headphones concluded there wasn't enough room in there for the circuitry so they put it in the base instead?3) Easy to break the ear cups.  If you run out of battery at least you can replace it.  The ear cups twist to the side.  This mechanism can either be really loose and easy to remove or sometimes it is like you super-glued the ear cup on.  If you force the ear cup the little plastic tabs will break and you will need to purchase \n",

            " camera I could keep with me at all times.The Dimage X is a stunning little package; anyone who sees it wants to pick it up, hold it, and play with it.  The design and finish are first-rate. The size, though -- that's what this camera is all about.  It's the first digicam to use an internal zoom mechanism, which allows the X to be ridiculously slim.  Other cameras might have a slightly smaller &quot;footprint&quot; but the X wins where it counts -- it is so slim you forget it's in your pocket.  As a result it is very easy to keep with you at all times.The Dimage X works very well in daily use.  The most important convenience is its' speed.  Many other cameras simply take too long to turn on, or have very long wait times as they record an image.  The little Minolta is among the swiftest of cameras in these regards.  It also allows you to fire off several frames in rapid succession; it appears to allow around five pictures, then pauses to record them to memory.  This is very handy when y\n",

In comparison to another small digicam, the Kyocera S3, the Dimage X offers approximately double the battery life.  It gives ridiculously long run times with the LCD display switched off; the camera's internal electronics seem very well designed and appear to operate very efficiently.  The camera never feels hot to the touch (or even warm, for that matter); I noticed this was a problem with the Kyocera, which may account for it's short run-times.The only thing I dislike about the Dimage X is its' image quality.  To keep the zoom mechanism inside the camera required the use of a prism.  This limits the camera from being as sharp, ultimately, as a conventional camera, and also leads to slightly less contrast and color saturation in the images.To qualify this review I should admit to being a perfectionist who is reluctant to EVER comprom\n",

It's time consuming: the exposed part is only ~ 1/4 turn of the wheel, and it takes ~ 1/2 hour to dry before coating the next 1/4 turn. So 1 coat = 2 hours, 2 coat = 4 hours. Also Plasti Dip recommends a final 4 hours of curing before use.\n",

The 870 replaced the 800 so I now have 2 870's and 1 800. Biggest thing I like about this camera is that it has a wider angle than any of the other ones. Mostly, the wife and kids shoot indoors or in a close setting. The wider angle allows for them to get more into the picture. They take great pictures and if/when we really need a good shot I have a Canon Digital SLR I use. So, it really works out great. They all have loved them, they're fairly easy to operate and if you want to get a bit more advanced, they also have that capability. Obviously, as I now have 3, I'd recommend them to anyone.

It comes with 3 different sizes of ear buds so I hope it can fit in all ear. The navigations are simple and easy. The sound control wheel is bit let down but I don't find it annoying at all. The expandable memory slot is really helpful for me as I already have a 1 GB SD card from my PDA. One problem with this player is if you switch off the player and switch it on, it plays from the beginning of the last track played (It's not smart enough to bookmark the exact spot on the track) So if you are listening any audio stories, you may have to fast forward every time you reset the player.Overall, I am completely satisfied with the player so far!

But in a nutshell, this works every bit as well as the Mohu Leaf and is the antenna I prefer because of its extra long cable.

            "min, the Magellan is an exercise in frustration.Let's just start from the beginning.Satellite connection:This thing took an inordinate amount of time to connect to the satellite signals when I first started it up. I don't know if this is because it was searching the entire world for the correct satellites, or what, but all the Garmin GPS devices I have used ask you to input your initial position manually, probably so that it doesn't have to go searching the entire sky to figure out which satellites to use and where you are. It took so long to connect, in fact, that I thought I had received a faulty unit.On subsequent startups, the connection was much quicker, but still not as fast as my two-year-old Garmin.Entering addresses:Typing in your destination address is a bad experience. Why? Well, as you type each letter, the Magellan tries to figure out which street you are talking about. This is fine, but as soon as it figures out -- or thinks it figures out -- what street you probably mean\n",
            ", it jumps to a screen of street name suggestions. This would be fine if it paused briefly before accepting new input. But it doesn't, and so fast typists like me will inevitably choose a street or city without seeing what we have selected, because we are still typing the name. Then you have to go back and start again.In comparison, the Garmin throws in a slight one second delay before allowing you to choose the intended street name from its list of suggestions. This prevents any accidental input.Navigation:Okay, this is a big one. The Magellan's navigation algorithms are, for want of a better word, funky. I had the machine set to give me the fastest, rather than the shortest, route. However, its alleged fastest route is almost never the actual fastest route. This is a huge problem, essentially negating one of the main benefits of a GPS. I know how to get to a lot of places around town in a roundabout way, but presumably a GPS is able to calculate the most direct route. However, as I e\n",
            "ntered in destinations into the Magellan, I was shocked and annoyed to find that its fastest route was always several minutes longer than the Garmin's fastest route. (For comparison's sake, I was often using the Magellan and the Garmin at the same time.)The Garmin always knew what it was doing. When I entered in an address across town, the Garmin usually told me to take the freeway (specifically, I 66), and would give me its estimated time of arrival. The Magellan, however, wanted me to take an odd, non-freeway route, with an estimated time of arrival of several minutes longer than the Garmin's calculation. I double-checked the Magellan's settings to make sure that freeways were enabled, and indeed they were. For some reason, the Magellan simply wasn't using them. When I decided to take the Garmin's advice, the Magellan eventually recalculated the route, and now that it was on the freeway, it gave me an updated time of arrival -- several minutes shorter than its original so-called fast\n",
            "est time.The Magellan's fastest time calculations are simply wrong. I know this not just from my experimental observations, but also because it has a neat feature where you can see a screen listing the estimated time of arrival using its various different navigation settings: fastest time, shortest route, etc. Frequently, it's \"fastest time\" was actually longer than the rest of the navigation options. This makes absolutely no sense and is indicative of a bug in the navigation algorithms.Voice guidance:Had I never used a Garmin GPS, I would have thought the Magellan's voice guidance was perfectly adequate. However, with the Magellan and the Garmin sitting next to each other, both trying to explain what to do next, the differences -- and the shortcomings of the Magellan -- were obvious. The Magellan's computerized voice was stilted, and nowhere as natural sounding as the Garmin. The Magellan would say something like, \"Right Turn, Point Five Miles, Harrison Street.\" The Garmin would say, \n",
            "\"In Point Five Miles, Turn Right on Harrison Street.\"Voice guidance on freeways was even worse, a crying shame considering the high speeds at which one drives on the freeway. You should not have to use any brainpower to decipher what the GPS is trying to tell you, and yet the Magellan required some concentration and decoding. It would bombard you with various route and exit numbers, giving you far more information than you need to take the next exit, and rattling off that information without natural pauses. It was frustrating.Freeway navigation theoretically should have been made more pleasing than the Garmin by the addition of Magellan's interesting sounding Exit Sign Technology. This feature allows you to display the various green freeway signs on the screen of your Magellan, highlighting the sign that you want to follow. This is supposed to be easier than just listening to the voice telling you which exit to take. But it really just adds confusion, as I have to stare at the differen\n",
            "t reproduced signs, (which are not actual pictures of the real highway signs, by the way, but just generic green highway signs that usually look nothing like the real signs), and try to figure out what it wants me to do. Again, this just requires more brainpower and makes it more likely that I will get confused at 80 mph and miss an exit.And the Magellan's timing was off. Timing on a GPS is a very subtle, yet important feature. The GPS has to be able to tell you when to turn at different times depending on what speed you are going, how far ahead the turn is, whether you're going to need to switch lanes quickly to make the turn, etc. Garmin's programmers got this right; Magellan's didn't. Again, this is something that I might not even have realized had I only been using the Magellan, and had I never used a Garmin. But, having had a successful GPS experience for years, the deficiencies in the Magellan's voice and timing algorithms were evident.Display:The navigation display colors are ho\n",
            "rrible. I don't know if the Magellan engineers had never used any other GPS devices, or did not focus group their display, but the colors they chose to delineate roads and routes are completely nonsensical. During the day, in order to indicate the routes to take, the Magellan highlights your suggested roads in a light yellowish green line, which is displayed over a slightly darker yellowish green background. At night, the color scheme is not much better. Now, my eyes are fine. I am in my late 20s and I can generally see things on a LCD monitor with no problem, and yet I had trouble seeing which roads were actually highlighted.The Garmin gets this right. It overlays a bright pink line against a gray background during the day, and a dark blue background at night. This is much easier to see. There are never any questions over whether or not a road is actually highlighted. I always know where I'm supposed to go.It is really ironic that the Magellan, which has an amazingly clear and bright \n",
            "LCD screen, would be so inferior in this area to my old clunky Garmin with its faded screen. But because of the questionable choice of colors, the Garmin crushes it.Does the Magellan have any pros?Sure. As I said, it has a beautiful screen. It is generally a fast machine (except for connecting to the satellite, sometimes). Its navigation interface, although cluttered, gives you quicker one touch access to destinations than the Garmin does. This is handy when on the highway, for instance -- it takes two taps to see the list of nearest gas stations (Where to, Gas), compared to four taps on the Garmin (Menu, Where to, Food/Fuel/Etc., Gas Stations). The Garmin is less cluttered, but it takes longer to wade through its many submenus. Finally, the Magellan's standard closing phrase (\"You have ARRIVED!\") sounds far cooler than the Garmin's ho-hum \"Now arriving.\"Bottom line:My two-year-old Garmin GPS is a far superior device to this brand-new Magellan. Had I never known the Garmin, I would be \n",
            "satisfied with the Magellan. But I know what a GPS device is capable of. I simply cannot use the Magellan because it is incredibly frustrating and gets a lot of things, most notably navigation calculations, very wrong.My advice? Look at Amazon's list of best selling GPS devices. The crowd is rarely wrong, and in this case the crowd and I both agree: If you want to get somewhere, Garmin is the way to go.\n",

            "$review_text.: Overall, I like this gizmo--for audio only.  I enjoy listening to music and podcasts on my Nano--fabulous sound quality!  And I like the light weight, under 1.5 ounces, so it's great to use when walking, exercising, or doing housework.  However, these middle-aged eyes don't want to squint at a tiny little screen to view photos or an addressbook, or play games.  Even before I needed reading glasses, I would have found the screen unpleasantly small for viewing anything other than the menu and the name of the song that was playing.  BTW, I like the fact that the Nano was simple to set up and use right out of the box.  Another feature I especially like is that you can pre-set the maximum volume so you don't accidentally blast your eardrums (which happened to me with a previous generation iPod.)Like all Apple products, the iPod Nano is overpriced.  Want to be able to recharge the batteries so you can use the device more than a few days?  \n",
            "You need to buy a power supply separately, and Apple's is $29.  (Several companies sell cheaper power supplies for iPods, both electrical and car chargers.)  And speaking of charging the battery, it would be nice to have an indicator on the screen telling you approximately how much battery power you have left.  Want a docking station?  You have to buy it separately.  Want FM radio with your iPod?  There's a gizmo that provides this, for a separate charge.For some reason, the 8 GB Nano only comes in 2 colors:  red and black, as opposed to the 4 GB Nano, which comes in 5 colors.  If you're paying for more disk space, why not have a choice of more colors?  I'm happy with basic black, however.  And not needing to have my entire music collection on one device, I'm happy with an 8 GB Nano, rather than nearly quadrupling the weight for a regular iPod.  I saw no reason to get the Shuffle (which holds 1/8th of the songs of this Nano), when the Nano is so light.In short, I think the product is o\n",

It does everything you need a tablet to do from watching videos, downloading all kinds of apps, listening to music, surfing the web, reading books, and most of all TAKING NOTES.My laptop has been gathering dust for a long time now since I got the Note 10.1.

I bought a Logitech keyboard for Android and now even word processing is\n",
            " a breeze on this (especially with good applications like Kingsoft, PowerWriter, and the built-in Polaris). You really can't go wrong with this device. It easily beats out the iPad (which I also own, the third generation) in everything except perhaps display (which is better on the iPad). The multi-tasking is just plain ridiculous on the Note 10.1 (ridiculous as in amazing -- sorry for the slang). You get Android 4.0 on the device initially, and that allows for multi-tasking. But when you update your software to the Jellybean version (4.1, I believe), you feel almost like you're on a computer. For a number of apps, you can use split screen, resize windows, etc. The other day I was able to keep open my Lecture Notes app (for handwriting notes), my Polaris app (for viewing documents), my calculator, a music player, and I'm still able to open more like movies, and YouTube and an Web browser!

It's so easy to watch videos and movies and shows on it in landscape with those speakers when you're with company. Also, let's not forget its main feature: The S-Pen! Another amazing innovation by Samsung. This is especially useful for students, artists, and business people. You can write as though you were using a pen and paper. You might wonder the usefulness of it, but trust me, you can do so much on a tablet with that kind of capability. It comes built in with photoshop which I don't use but everyone I know seems to rave over...and the S-Pen seems to be a natural tool for this app. For apps that I use like S-Note, the ability to type something and then draw an illustration or a chart or write out an equation/formula saves me so m\n",

The handwriting recognition is also one of those features that when you try it you, you'll wonder how the heck did you live without it?Going from this to the iPad was a major step down. I own both and use both, but this is a far superior machine with far superior functions. I personally think that this is not only the best Android tablet out there currently, but that it is better than any tablet so far ever made. This device not only makes things like gaming, movies, etc. possible and enjoyable, but goes a step further by making the tablet a serious tool for actual work like writing and note-taking and editing images, etc.While I can go on and on about how much I love the tablet and how great it is compared to the competition with all its features and capabilities, there are going to be some drawbacks naturally as no device is perfect. The battery life is good, but that's because I rarely take it off Power Saving mode and only occasionally type on it. The built-in \n",
            "S-note is limited to some extent in that it doesn't carry with it other useful features found in ordinary word processors like word count. As a handwriting app, it's great, but I find myself using Lecture Notes more (a couple of bucks on the Play store) because the size of each page on the latter as well as the ability to customize between college ruled or wide ruled (or blank) makes it feel more like paper when writing notes completely by hand. Accessories don't seem to be anywhere near as common (if a lot even exist) for this device as for the competition especially as for the iPad. Keyboard cases designed for the Note 10.1 are horrible made-in-China products that work only barely and are not suitable for fast and/or accurate typing. Even Samsung's keyboard dock for this device doesn't even exist in the US as of yet, and if you're in the States and want to buy one, it looks like you're going to have to settle for one from Europe, like the UK (though I've heard there are some US onlne\n",

It's not a &#34;bad&#34; display by far, but the Retina Display is simply crisp and beautiful to look at. Also, I don't like the 10.1&#34; design (others may disagree). I feel that a shape like the iPad's is more practical for writing notes and doing things like playing games, but that might just be a very personal preference. (In case you don't know, the Note 10.1 is longer/larger than the iPad by a bit, but it is more rectangular in shape while the iPad comes closer to a square in shape, but not quite a square.)I don't know what else to say: if you have any questions, just ask and I'll be happy to reply.My final opinion: I think that this device convinced me that the tablet can be seriously used as a device for work as well as pleasure, and that accessory makers should start focusing on this product for making keyboards, cases, etc.\n",

The sony has the BEST picture quality simply set to auto. The next would be the Nikon and Pany tied for 2cd with the Pany taking much better quality photos, and the 3rd would be the HS10 which in my HUMBLE opinion STANK in auto.I returned the Sony to Wolf camera basically because I wanted to try the new HS10 ,which hadn't been released yet, and the fact that I owned so many nice FAST SDHC class 6 and 10 memory cards. And then I end up returning the Fuji. After the Sony I realized how bad the pics taken with the Fuji really were. But it was too late. So I just got the Panasonic.

I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the sound quality is for a unit this small. I would compare the sound quality to that of a good quality nightstand radio (or radio/CD player/alarm clock, etc.). My desktop and laptop (the former running Windows 7 64-bit, the latter Vista) recognized the USB dongle right away, so for me set up was literally plug & play. I did have to discover on my o\n",
            "wn (this wasn't in the literature) that turning the speaker off (there's a button on the upper rear of the unit) turns Windows Media Player off, and in order to switch from using the Z515 to wired speakers I have to remove the USB dongle (and can do so by simply removing it, i.e., no need to go through a \"safely remove this hardware\" step). (If I want to mute the unit without turning Windows Media Player off, I have to remember to simply turn it down instead of off.)One bit of information you won't find in the literature or at the Logitech website concerns the life of and potential to replace the built-in rechargeable battery. I emailed Logitech and received a response within less than 24 hours, and am told that Logitech will replace the unit \"free of charge\" should the battery fail within the 2 year warranty period, and that the battery is otherwise NOT \"user\" replaceable. Whether this means that it can be replaced by a handy user who is into opening gadgets up remains to be seen, but\n",
            " I do want to mention that the presence of recessed screws on the rear of the unit lead me to think that it may at least be possible to open the unit up (after the warranty period has passed, of course) and maybe replace the battery. In any case, the speaker can also be AC powered via the included adapter.I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker to a laptop using student living in a dorm or anyone whose living quarters are small or who travels with a laptop - or simply an MP3 player (which requires a wired connection) - and wants to have with them a handy portable travel speaker. The Z515 comes with a handsome zippered carrying case with a fairly rugged exterior (the carrying case holds the speaker but not the AC adapter; the USB dongle fits into a compartment under the fold-out speaker stand) to protect it during transport.

Although the sound is stereo - there are two speakers side-by-side in the unit - because of the size of the unit and short distance of the speakers from each other, the sound of the Z515 is akin to that of a good quality mono table radio. I personally don't get much sense of stereo separation when listening to it, but I don't count this as a drawback or con given the size, convenience, portability, and overall sonic quality of the unit.\n",

Image quality of the K-5ii is as good as the K-3 -- in fact, the K-5ii gets a higher score from Dxomark.  The K-3 has better video features than the K-5ii, but no Pentax or Nikon camera gives really good control over video -- you're much better off with an inexpensive camcorder.

My previous mouse wasMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000and I felt that that mouse hit the sweet spot in terms of the weight strain I wanted to put on my hands.Back on topic, excluding that one con, the G700 is full of win. As with my previous mouse, the \"Plug-in Nano Receiver\" doesn't stick out of the USB port reducing the risk of accidentally clipping it. The scrolling wheel has two settings which can be changed at the press of a button, freespin and \"notched\" spin mode. The freespin mode allows you to scroll down a page without the worry of friction on the wheel (much beneficial in gaming mode). The \"notched\" mode adds some friction to the \n",

Yes, there are indeed a lot of buttons. Downside is that you will barely use them unless you play a lot of MMORPGS (which unfortunately, I don't). Anyways, I popped in a game of Crysis to observe the results and compare it with my older mouse. I can barely explain them in technical terms, but the response times were amazing, a lot better than my previous mouse. No missed hits, no blaming on the lag. The mouse is set at 500 reports/second right out of the box, but can go as high as 1000.Being a gaming mouse, this thing is designed for comfort, which I believe degrades the overall look. The battery is rechargeable and it comes with a cable to do so. The cable port is same as a HTC HD2's, so if you happen to lose it, you know what to look for. There is a button designed to change the speed of the mouse without having to go to the Control Panel\n",

I frantically called SquareTrade. My call was taken care of quickly and professionally.

But we have a wide room and even from viewing angles of 45 the effect is still present with only very minor drop-offs in color and brightness (the picture noticeably dims once the 3D glasses are powered on, especially when the room is bright).3D setup and playback is a cinch -- the sync signal is bluetooth, so each pair of glasses needs to be paired the first time used. Pairing involves nothing more than turning the glasses on, and since the bluetooth signal is bi-directional, the television recognizes when the glasses are activated and provides a brief pop-up indication in the lower left corner saying so.After that initial setup, inserting a 3D disk and pressing play is all that's required to get the show going.

There's no apparent glare, and the brightness of the screen even at the factory setting (if I recall correctly, it's initially set at brightness level 48) is more than enough overcome this ambient light, without washing out the deep, dark black levels. (The 3D glasses reflect lighted surfaces located directly behind my head; in this case a darker room is preferred lest I need to fashion side-shades for the glasses.) In a dark room, the picture is simply jaw-dropping.Even the built-in speakers of this set do an adequate job of getting the sound out.

The two-sided remote resembles a conventional numbers-only device on one side, beaming our traditional infrared signals. The keyboard side takes advantage of the D8000's bluetooth, and is therefore only compatible with the television, and not the Samsung DVD player, nor any other device.

My one gripe is that once I locate and begin watching a movie, but then pause it and return to finish it on a different day, it has taken me quite a bit of searching to re-find it. But once I do, it resumes where I left off, and all of the expected pause, fast forward and rewind functions work as expected. However, once inside the Netflix app, I'm locked out of accessing the television's menu, so I lose the ability to adjust picture (and audio, if using the TV speakers).There are a number of redundant SmartTV features between the television and my Samsung DVD player, and if it were truly \"smart,\" might it not somehow combine these Samsung web apps so that I'm only dealing with one Netflix, one YouTube, one browser, etc.? Because it sure would be nice to use the QWERTY remote on everything, including Pandora, which (I believe) isn't available as an application on the television\n",
            ". As it is, each application has its own login process, with the Netflix process being quite different from Pandora or YouTube, for instance.The YouTube app needs improvement. It doesn't make use of the remote's QWERTY keypad, and instead requires the user to use the cursor buttons to scroll around the on-screen virtual keyboard to conduct a video search. Instead, I use the TV's built-in web browser to access YouTube, which works pretty well, even in full-screen mode.The most desirable part of the Facebook app would be the photo viewer, which for some inexplicable reason won't take advantage of the full screen size -- even for photos that were uploaded at full resolution. This makes showing off baby and vacation pictures a bit of a yawner. The photos tend to be small and a little washed out, though easy to navigate between albums.

I'm an engineer, so was able to plow though some technical forum postings, but most non-techies would be stumped by this.

I read that WD metaphorically shrugs and blames Microsoft, but by providing no insert in the disk drive packaging to warn and/or provide a work around, they are just leaving their customers hanging.I started my research by searching the Amazon reviews and found some tips and tricks that had worked for others to get a single WD drive recognized, but none of them worked in this case. Here is what I tried: reversed the order of plugging in USB cable and drive power, added some media, i.e. put the new empty drive on another computer and copied over a file to it, renamed the new drive so drives had different names, enabled/disabled the drives in Device Manager, and rebooted a bunch of times. All to no avail.Here's what did work. I had read on a WD forum that one user with the same problem had gotten his drives working by plugging both drives into a Window7 Pro.

At that point he was able to move the drives back to Windows Home, and they now were both recognized, the signatures apparently fixed (permanently) by the other machine.I have an old Windows XP machine, so I used that. I just plugged both 2TB WD drives into the XP and let them sit for a minute or two until their drive lights stopped flashing, and sure enough when I moved them back to my Window7 Home machine, both drives now displayed in Explorer and both could be accessed.

I was looking for a lens with image quality above 200mm but did not want to incur the cost of purchasing one of the excellent Canon \"L\" lenses. Further, I wanted Image Stabilization and USM if possible. During reviews, I found that this zoom lens came as close to a full 5-star rating as any on the market in the non-L category. Since obtaining the lens, it has complimented my two other lenses quite nicely, one being the Canon 18-135mm \"walk-around\" lens and the super-fine Canon 17-55mm 2.8 IS USM non-L lens. The Bokeh is unbelievable; the sharpness of detail is as good as I could have desired. During a recent trip to the Canaveral National Seashore, I was able to get distant photos of Alligators and Roseate Spoonbill birds that were exceedingly sharp. And I was able to use the Canon IS feature to take shots at 250-300mm without a tripod.I now find that I am spoiled. While I went into this purchase with my eyes wide open, \n",

This causes me, so far, to do most of my shooting with the 17-55mm and the 70-300mm creating the need to change lenses too frequently between the 17-55mm and the 70-300mm. I give up the walk-around feature that I enjoyed with the 18-135mm. Perhaps this will change in time and I will again start using my older 18-135mm for the purpose intended - a walk-around lens that I keep on my camera most of the time.

Maybe I was just disillusioned because I thought it would work like a real camera, but either way it didn't perform up to snuff for the price I paid for it  (its retail was $80.00).When I received the \"QuickCam Pro 9000\" I was very leery because of my past experience (right or wrong).  I read the fancy description of the box about its lenses being designed by Carl Zeiss.  He is makes lenses for space exploration, so I thought \"Well, maybe this is higher quality than my last one...\"  However, I was not holding out hope.As usual the set-up was very simple; just put in the disc and install the Logitech software and then plug in the webcam.  So, I did that and then started using the camera immediately.  I am sad to say that I didn't think it was a whole lot better than the Pro 5000, except a couple details.1.  The sound quality is far better than it was on the Pro 5000.\n",

I was very much impressed with the visual quality of the ProCam 9000 .I wish I could've taken back my old camera and paid the extra $20.00 because the sound quality and picture quality are that much better on the Pro9000.  The other features on this one are basically the same as their other cameras because it comes with the same software is the other camera. Still, if you are looking for a decent webcam that is $100.00 or less, I would say that you cannot go wrong with this one.God Bless & *enjoy*  ~Amy\n",

            "$review_text.: I have the original \"Zagg Mate\" case/keyboard for the first iPad.  For the most part, I liked that case: a perfect fit for the iPad, but the keyboard was kind of cramped.At first glance, this new case for the iPad 2 (made by Zagg, sold by Logitech) looks extremely similar to the original.  However, there are several noteworthy improvements over the original:1) First and foremost, the keyboard is noticably more spacious.  Slightly smaller enter/tab/shift/caps lock keys, and some other minor rearranging has led to keys that have a little more space between them, both horizontally and vertically.  On the old Zagg Mate, I frequently typed the incorrect keys.  On this one (I'm using it now to type this review), the layout is perfect for my hands.2) It's easier than it used to be to set up the iPad on the stand.  On the old Zagg Mate, there was a little flip-up holder that\n",
            " needed to be set up to hold the iPad in its place.  On this version, there is no need for the flip-up.  Whether you want the iPad in portrait or landscape mode, just set it in the slot and go.3) Other minor improvements: dedicated cut/copy/paste keys, magnets that turn on/off the iPad 2 (just like the smart cover), and easy bluetooth connectivity all help to make this a great keyboard/case.Final verdict: This is a great case!  I was hesitant to get it because of my experience with the original version, but this one is a great big step forward!\n",

My only harware-related criticism is that there seems to be no way to keep the cool display lit permanently while the UPS is on mains power. Maybe there's a way to set this through the Cyberpower Software? Maybe...but I'll never know.What I hate about this product is that the software that comes with this UPS is deficient. In point of fact, it does not work for me at all. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the original and the newest version of the CP software on my PC (Windows 7, i5 64 bit quad core processor, 8G of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 video card), but it never works. The icon appears in my taskbar, but the program will not open. Process Manager shows that it's running, but the GUI never shows up. Each time I reinstall the program, the first time I try to start the GUI, I get a small white window in the middle of my screen. All subsequent attempts to run the GUI result in nothing at all.What I wanted to \n",

For example, I wanted to set the point at which the PC would shut down, what the max CPU percentage would be, the cooling policy, etc. And oh yeah, set the blinkenlights to stay on. My last UPS was an APC, and their software was really nice. In addition to a user friendly GUI to set when the PC should perform an orderly shutdown during a power failure, it showed me a history of power failure or line noise incidents. But the APC had no blinkenlights at all!I called CyberPower support, but was told they had no idea what was wrong, and they didn't seem to care much about my problem. It's possible that my PC's hardware specs are uncommon (it's homebrew), but it doesn't seem all that arcane to me. It's not overclocked, everything is running vanilla. Personally, I think it may be a compatibility problem with the video card or drivers. This software may work for everyone but me, however I can only rate a product based \n",

The \"Power Options\" in the control panel didn't seem to know about the UPS, and--oddly--no \"Battery\" options were present. I now think the CyberPower software took control of the UPS from the OS. However, I did figure out how to fix this: I just now uninstalled the CyberPower software (for the last time), and found that the Windows 7 Control Panel power options now permit me to select actions to be taken on low battery conditions!I think that if CP is not going to support their software, they should just sell the UPS with directions on how to set the power options through the Control Panel, and forget about distributing the software at all.\n",

This may seem obvious, but a small remote did come in the package and even had an up and down buttons to suggest you could change the channels.I was hooking up a TV in my office area so I could watch football on Sundays as these days it seems I'm always working weekends and wanted a way to watch football off a direct TV receiver that neither my wife nor my kids would likely be using during the day. The solution was to connect the transmitter to the DVR unit we have in our bedroom which again took all of two minutes. My office is in the basement while our bedroom is on the first floor but on the opposite side of the house so the signal had to go through a floor and a few walls. The signal was still very strong with no flicker or other video feed disruptions.If it was possible, I would have given the product a score of 4.5 as I couldn't give the product five stars (although the reception is like watching my bedroom TV) but for the fact the instructions could be a bit clearer.\n",

            " good.  You just have to press the top edge of the battery door shut a with a bit of pressure, before pushing the other end in.  Once the top end locks in - the rest will snap right in place.The thing couldn't be easier to use.  I've used a digital meter, and this is JUST as a straightforward (maybe more so).  Its hard to see from the image how it works - but on that big dial (which you adjust the ISO) the F numbers are printed.  You turn on the unit, and it is ready to receive a flash.  If you have the flash connected with a pc synch you can just press the flash button on the meter to remotely fire it.  Or even better, if you are using RF triggers, and you have a little PC to 1/8th jack cord, you can connect it to your RF trigger and fire your flash remotely! (Check out the picture I uploaded for how it connects). Otherwise, manually fire off your flash and the an LED will light up behind the corresponding F number.  On top of the meter you will see LED lights for 1/3 and 2/3 F stops.\n",
            "This is because just about every camera reads F stops in third increments.  So if you didnt know, the difference between F8 and F11 is a 1 full stop (not three), so F9 is really F8 and 1/3rd, and F10 is F8 and 2/3rds.This is very simple to figure out.  If your meter lights up with F8 and the 1/3 stop light also - than the exposure is F9.  If you cant figure it out - tune your camera to the number on the dial (F8), and if there is an additional 1/3 stop lit up - simply tune your aperture on your camera one more notch, if the 2/3 lights up tune it 2 notches on the dial of your camera.I dont have anything to calibrate against, but the exposure seems pretty spot on - and even if it was off at all (as I said, I'm not a lighting expert...yet), the exposure is consistent.  I've read someone having trouble having it read the flash - it didnt miss a single flash of mine and I tried it all distances and power levels.I hate the picture they have of this thing, it makes it look pretty chintzy - bu\n",

I use a completely manual off-camera flash, I tuned in a flash power that I thought was appropriate (bounced off a card) and read it with the meter.  I dialed in exactly what it read onto my camera and took the shot.  If you think my image is properly exposed (I do), then it works!I'm quite happy with the purchase.\n",

Having the chance to use Nikon's 18-200mm VR lens has made me a real believer of how important a really good lens is for great photography.My only major gripes about the d40x is the lack of adjustment buttons and no aperture dial the higher end dSLR's have. It can be somewhat annoying having to go into the camera's menu screen to make simple adjustments.The PRO's for sure outweigh the few CON's this camera has. It's a great dSLR camera to start out with. The only real limitations of the d40x will be the skill level of the person behind it.\n",

            "$REVIEW.: Compared these head-to-head with Bose QC2 which I had owned a couple months before hearing about the A-Ts.  You will see I have a slightly different take from a couple previous reviewers; obviously personal perceptions play significantly.  Here are my results:- Noise cancellation:  About the same.  However, I hear a very noticeable hiss from the A-Ts when they're turned on in a quiet environment; the Bose NR introduces a much-reduced 'ambient' hiss.- Sound quality:  A-T much more accurate, though it would be nice to have a tad more bass.  The Bose go too far the other way, with bloated bass and recessed mids.  An added A-T advantage:  It will pass the music through even with the NR turned off (or dead battery).  The Bose plays nothing with no power.- Comfort:  Bose has edge.  Its earcups feel slightly bigger around and deeper, with less contact on my ears.  Pressure and padding feel about the same between\n",
            " the two.- Construction:  I can't tell much difference.  The A-Ts feel perhaps more sturdy, but it's very subtle and subjective and I wouldn't bank much on it.- Other:  Battery life is about the same, from the same single AAA battery.  Bose uses proprietary audio cord, while the A-T cord uses standard plug on both ends so would be cheaper to replace.  Both store in similar flat cases, though the A-T case is slightly thicker.- The Bose-Killer:  Price.  The QC2 is better than A-T in a couple areas but IMHO is way overpriced at $185 more--especially if you care about sound quality.\n",

Both side products are too long, and the user must trim them if access to the DVD player and headphone jack are important.- The side/front/back pieces are also just a tad too wide. Result: after 3 months of use, all of my pieces are peeling away on the edges. Once they peel a bit more, I'll just chuck them. Zagg could have made the parts the right size and/or used better adhesives.- The top is just a little mis-sized. Current design doesn't leave quite enough overlap to give sufficient sticking surface as the top wraps around the Al MacBook Pro part. Just a little larger would have given enough sticking area. Or, Zagg could have cut the part just a little smaller and not worried about needing to have a skinny surface stick. As it is, a\n",

That's the good news. The bad news is that they take your credit card number and require you to return an entire Shield or they'll charge your card. They don't even pay return shipping. That's part of why I'll just chuck the bad side pieces on my unit rather than return it for \"free\" replacement.Oh: if you need to remove a large piece of Shield as I did, WOW IS IT A PAIN!!! While edges may peel away and trap dirt and look lousy, large, adhered surfaces really stick!Based on my experience with this unit, I will probably NOT buy another Invisible Shield for future MacBook Pros, and will think hard about buying them for other devices.

Cameras cannot be bought for less than $300 and expected to be up to par with your professional grade DLSRs. My advice, do NOT buy this camera. Look instead to the Canon SX40 HS.

The stickers were one of my favorite parts, because getting those last few specks off is often an issue.After cleaning the screen thoroughly, adding the protector was easy.

The protector is very slightly smaller than the screen - which is good, because otherwise it would be extremely easy to accidentally pry it up - and so until you've put the protector on, you're not quite sure exactly how to place it. The holes around the camera, top earpiece, etc. are large enough that you can't just rely upon looking at them. Anyway, barring that change, bear in mind that the protector will have a very thin (1mm or less) margin around it, so plan accordingly. My suggestion? Just lay it on the display with both of the peel-off layers on it before beginning any cleaning, just to get a feel for the margins.Bubbles smoothed out well. Simply ensure you've removed all dust (and oil), and the protector will lay down perfectly.Screen feel isn't quite as frictionless as the Gorilla Glass 3, but it's quite good.

I was actually pleasantly surprised by them. They aren't phenomenal by any stretch, but they're better than most other headphones I've tried at this price level, making them an excellent value. Let me rate each aspect of them:Treble: 9/10 - Crisp, clear highs. Music is detailed and punchy.Mids: 8/10 - Good balance in the mid-range, but not too mid-rangy.Bass: 5/10 - Not a strong suit for sure, but few headph\n",

Easily better than most, but not great.Coloration: 7/10 - I have not done true testing on these, but based on my non-technical observations, one of the most surprising aspects of these headphones is the lack of tonal coloration. Most headphones (especially in this price range) have significant coloration of the tone across the frequency spectrum. These have some (to the high-mid and low-treble side of things), but not nearly as much as I expected.Noise Isolation: 8/10 - Creates a good seal in the ear canal, blocking out ambient noise pretty well. Better than anticipated at this price range.Comfort: ??? - Not sure how comfortable these will be as I haven't had occasion to wear them for longer periods of time. However, I will say this: I typically HATE earbuds. I think they are one of the worst types of headphones. They are totally uncomfortable, they get tangled too easily, break too easily, and just don't have the size to r\n",

I often find the earbuds falling out after a short period of use. I guess I just don't have the size/shape of ear canals that are conducive to this type of design. Accordingly, I have a hard time finding earbuds that seem to fit well. With that in mind, I was VERY pleasantly surprised that these earbuds fit immediately out of the box, with very little adjusting, pushing, or rearranging needed. They went in quickly...and not uncomfortably...and they stayed put - a significant enough feat on its own. And once I started listening to music with them, I forgot they were there - which is a stunning achievement. Typically with earbuds I'm ACUTELY aware at all times that I'm wearing earbuds. With these, they were such a good fit that they kind of got themselves out of the way. This alone is worth the price of admission for these h\n",

Note that your mileage may vary depending on the size/shape of your ear canal, since everyone is different, though I was pleased to see that the box included two additional set of the rubber earbud mounts - one size smaller than the standard, and one size larger...a very helpful addition.\"Accessories\": 6/10 - The big plus here are the additional earbud pieces, as noted above. The two major omissions are not specific to these headphones, but are annoying nonetheless. The first is the lack of in-line volume control. As far as I'm concerned, every single pair of headphones over $10 should include these. They don't cost that much more to implement, but are infinitely useful. For those who don't need/want them, they don't have to use them. But for those who DO use them, they are invaluable, and their omission here is worth noting. The second is the absence of any kind of carrying case. ESPECIALLY with these thin-wire-type earbuds, they get tangled easily, and even moreso when you\n",
            " have to shove them in a bag or a pocket without any kind of case. This should also be standard for all but the cheapest headphones. Again, these aren't specific to just these headphones, but still worth noting for sure.Overall, I'm very pleasantly surprised by these headphones. Their sound is crisp and clean, with a slight upper-midrange coloration. They lack bass, but still have more than many in this price range. While long-term comfort remains to be seen, they fit (my ears, at least) right out of the box, and stayed put. These headphones are good overall, but are an excellent value. So if the highest fidelity isn't the most important thing for you, and you can do without a couple of accessories (albeit crucial ones), these offer excellent bang for your buck. Recommended.\n",

I needed a flash for a wedding overseas to use with my Canon 60D. I looked online extensively, not wanting to spend much over $100, yet not wanting to have to buy a better flash in a few months. If you're looking at this then you know the 565EX is a twin to a much more expensive Canon flash. I definitely wanted ETTL since the flash would be camera mounted on my overseas trip. And it needed enough power to be able to bounce light off walls or ceiling. I was a bit hesitant since I read mixed reviews about the flash suddenly stopping, or overheating during a shoot. But I had no problems with it. Flash arrived packaged well, in a branded box tucked inside its sturdy cloth pouch. I examined it and wa\n",

Also, once I put the batteries in (rechargeable AA's) I was not looking forward to hefting the weight of it around on a full day shoot. But I'm used to it since I use my LED light on my camera for video shoots.Ok, so then I checked the sparsely written and somewhat comical translation of the manual and understood the functions a bit better. Then I did an extensive test with the 60D, using it in various bounce settings in low light to simulate wedding conditions. Wow! I thought 'how can I miss!\" The ETTL worked perfectly. During my test I tried different types of batteries, and of course the Eneloops were the way to go if I didn't want to wait to take another shot.

The obvious cons to the flash are the manual and lack of high speed shutter. It's also slave-only and the audible beeps are astonishingly noisy (you turn it off deep in a function menu). If you need the ETTL with occasion to use it as a strobist flash get this one. It also works with Nikon (same unit right out of the box will work with either camera). If ETTL is no concern then get the 468ll or the 560lll. The 565EX is more powerful, has zoom range to 105mm and works wirelessly with ETTL.

I went to the menu and told it to update, and it said I had to eject my current disc before it would consider updating.- My old Samsung DVD player (DVD-HD860) would remember where you were on a disc when you turned it off (or ejected).  When you booted back up to that disc, you'd be right back where you left off.

            "$REVIEW.: So I'm currently using this at work to add a 3rd monitor as an extended desktop to my other two.  I have to say with Windows XP at least the set up is really quite nice and easy.  Lots of options for cloning or extending and a great deal of control over which monitor is which.One interesting thing that is worth mentioning is that you can have up to 6 of these.  That means 6 additional monitors can conceivably be added to your current set up should you ever have a desire for such a thing (although I personally would hate it as I'd never be able to find my cursor).  Now you can only do one monitor per device\n",
            " you buy.  If you DO want to do 6, you'll have to buy 6 of these.It also  allows you to add a VGA port to a device that doesn't have one.  Why do I care about this?  Well...it sure would be nice to play video files on my Dell Duo (tablet/netbook) on my HDTV.  Since it has no HDMI, VGA, or DVI port natively, this would allow that.  I'm sure you can think of other devices with this same issue...An additional point of interest for some - normally when you clone monitors in Windows you have to set both monitors at the same resolution.  Further it means you have to go with the resolution of the worst monitor as a max and that mixing monitors of differing aspect ratios will yield weird results.  (for instance, if you have a monitor that's capable of 1920x1200 and one that can only do 1280 x 1024, you'll have to run both at 1280x1024 or less).  This device allows you to clone monitors...at different resolutions!  If you don't need this...you don't care.  But if you do, you KNOW what a huge de\n",
            "al this is!The only complaint I have with the way I'm currently using it is that whenever my computer goes to sleep, whatever is on the 3rd monitor (the one on this device) gets pushed over to one of the other screens.  Very minor, but I have so many applications open at once that it'd be nice if they stayed put over there.However, that said here are some other things worth knowing (for most people these wouldn't be issues I don't think, but just in case it doesn't happen to impact you...)I originally got it for an embedded project since it would have been a lot nicer to have a USB port than a VGA port + power.  It was a nice small form factor for it, but ultimately I didn't end up using it because:1. It requires a driver to install.  This means that every computer you plug it into will need to install this software.  That's fine if you have a specific computer you're going to use it on.  Not so much for an embedded device that needs to plug into a variety of computers.2. I don't know \n",

The resolution stayed set from the last computer I used it on and as for cloning and extending the video card of the computer recognized it as a 3rd monitor.  It did mean I could technically use it, but I didn't have all options available and I wasn't able to get the exact set up I wanted because I couldn't access the software.  On the XP computers I didn't have this issue.  You may find you also only have access to some options if whatever impacted me shows up for you.  (It really may be the Win 7 thing)3. It's a teeny bit of a power hog.  I had a USB hub internal to my device.  I should have had about 200 mA available for this, but it exceeded it a few times which wasn't a big deal but I got flicker because of that.  Unless you are also using it on an unpowered hub with other devices though, you\n",

Here's a list of what I found impressive:PROSGreat keyboard - both the overall design and the feel. (Note: I didn't like the nonstandard placement of the control key. I went into the BIOS to swap it with FN key to get the normal position - now I'm happy).Very quiet (with exception of DVD drive - see below)7200 RPM 500GB hard drive seems plenty quiet and fasti5 2410m processor gives you turbo mode when needed (over less expensive system\n",
            "s that have the i3 2310m). I've noticed it kick in for sluggish web sites like bgr.com (can hear the fan get louder when this happens).Boot time 25 seconds to user screen, then 8 seconds after clicking on user. My boot time is now 30+10=40 total seconds after adding my own software. Resume from standby: less than 2 seconds.includes fingerprint reader, bluetooth, webcamThe overall hardware build quality very good considering the priceThe software build quality is terrific. Many system builders layer on so much junk onto Windows that it starts out of the box slow and buggy - not so with this unit. Includes Symantec's Norton Internet Security which I was using anyway (and have liked since version 10.0), and the Windows office starter, and a useful suite of Lenovo utilities. That's it.*****************************That being, said, this IS part of the budget lineup. Here's what I noticed was given up in this model in order to hit this price point:CONSNo keyboard Thinklight or key back light\n",
            "ing of any kind. The black keyboard can't be seen in dim light so you'll need an external light source at night. Most of the more expensive Lenovo's have this desirable feature.The screen is usable and without defects but is mediocre. I'm used to high quality screens for my desktop units and this is not even close, with poor viewing angles, less sharp text, muted colors, etc. It doesn't matter for me because I use it 98% of the time hooked up to a high quality 24\" monitor/TV.The DVD drive is a cheap unit that is obnoxiously loud. Thankfully, I greatly reduced the noise from this by going into the BIOS and choosing the \"silent\" option for the DVD drive which is a tradeoff - I sacrifice speed in order to get quiet. This is well worth it for me as I'll be using it primarily to play movies, which don't require a rapidly spinning drive.Default touchpad settings were not so great. Took quite a bit of fiddling with the touchpad settings to increase responsiveness and accuracy.WHY I BOUGHT THE\n",
            " e520We have a family room which doubles as my early AM/late PM home office, as well as a home entertainment center. So we've been using a slow, hot, noisy old Dell desktop to run Windows XP Media Center Edition. I've been waiting patiently for years to replace it with a much better HTPC with appropriate price/performance.The Mac Mini seems like the perfect form factor yet in the Windows world you have to spend at least $1000 to get similar quality. If you literally buy a current Mac Mini, you'd also have to buy a Windows license, an external DVD drive, and a TV tuner which works with Macs, which tend to be more expensive than Windows TV tuners. So the price goes almost up to $1000 that route as well.In doing my research for the HTPC, it become obvious that laptop components are better suited for HTPC use because they use less power and therefore run less hot and less noisy (less fan cooling required). However, until 2011, integrated graphics in notebooks were usually not adequate. Now\n",
            " there's Intel's Sandy Bridge mobile parts, namely the i5 2410m (or not quite as powerful i3 2310m) combined with Intel's integrated HD 3000 graphics. It is the HD 3000 which is the key - it is more than enough graphics power to easily handle any kind of HTPC use.So I started looking at inexpensive laptops and was pleasantly shocked at how much computer you can get for about six hundred dollars. I settled on the e520 for this purpose because it included a 7200 RPM 500GB hard drive which none of the notebooks with i5 2410m did at around the same price point. Dell was very close but with them you never know how much junk they put on your computer in the budget models which might hobble the system.WHY THIS UNIT WORKS SO WELL FOR MESo how is this working (after getting past the setup of figuring out how to make the DVD drive less noisy and getting the external monitor to be the main monitor)?Great! It's quiet and fast. It's relatively attractive. Windows 7 and Media center run fine (and no\n",

I did need to get a powered USB hub to accommodate the numerous USB devices but that's a good idea anyway to keep the unit running cooler. In the event we want to view a movie or TV recording in another part of the house, I'll be able to just disconnect the laptop and carry it there.Given how great this budget Lenovo unit is, I can only imagine how great the more expensive units are. But for someone planning to use their laptop primarily in a stationary setup like mine where you have plenty of light and an external monitor - this unit is a terrific value.\n",
